The impact of marital status on the lives of beginner English speaker masculine individuals can vary greatly. Here are some possible effects:

1. Social isolation: Married individuals may feel more isolated in their language learning journey due to the demands of their spouse and family. They may have less time and energy to devote to language learning, leading to slower progress or a lack of motivation.
2. Financial constraints: Married individuals may face financial constraints that can impact their ability to invest in language learning resources such as courses, tutors, or software. This can limit their access to quality language learning materials and hinder their progress.
