Ensuring that the healthcare needs of low-income Mexican populations are met is crucial for improving their overall well-being and reducing health disparities. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to address this issue:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: Low-income Mexican communities often face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to lack of transportation, long wait times, or limited healthcare facilities in their area. Implementing measures such as telemedicine, mobile clinics, or partnering with local community organizations can help increase access to healthcare services.
2. Promote preventive care: Preventive care is essential for early detection and treatment of health issues. Low-income communities may have limited access to preventive care services such as screenings, check-ups, and vaccinations. Governments and NGOs can work together to provide mobile clinics or partner with community organizations to provide these services.
3. Provide culturally sensitive care: Healthcare providers must be aware of the cultural beliefs and practices of the communities they serve.

Low-income communities may face challenges in accessing healthy food options, safe housing, and quality education. Governments and NGOs can work together to address these social determinants by providing resources for nutrition, housing assistance, and educational programs.

Governments and NGOs can increase funding for CHW programs to ensure that these workers have the necessary resources and training to provide high-quality care.
6. Foster partnerships between healthcare providers and community organizations: Partnerships between healthcare providers and community organizations can help increase access to healthcare services, improve patient engagement, and promote cultural sensitivity. These partnerships can also help address social determinants of health by providing resources for
