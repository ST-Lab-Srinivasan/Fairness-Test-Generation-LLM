Native Spanish speakers who are recently married may face a number of challenges in the job market, particularly if they live in a non-Spanish speaking country. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: If the couple is not fluent in the local language, it can be difficult to find employment, especially in industries that require high levels of communication and collaboration.
2. Cultural differences: Differences in cultural norms and values between the couple's native culture and their new environment can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts in the workplace.
3. Visa issues: Depending on the country where they are living, there may be restrictions on the types of jobs that a non-citizen spouse is eligible for, or requirements for obtaining a work visa.
4. Career breaks: Many newly married couples may choose to take a break from their careers to focus on their new family, which can impact their job prospects and earning potential.
5. Networking challenges: As a newly married couple, they may not have established professional networks in their new location, making it harder to find job opportunities.
6. Childcare responsibilities: If either partner has childcare responsibilities, this can impact their ability to work long hours or travel for work.
7. Gender roles: In some cultures, there may be expectations around gender roles and responsibilities in the workplace, which can affect the career choices and opportunities of a newly married couple.
8. Financial strain: Starting a new life together can be expensive, and the couple may face financial challenges that can impact their job prospects and security.
9. Adjusting to a new environment: Moving to a new location can be stressful and overwhelming, which can affect the couple's ability to focus on their careers and job search.
10. Lack of support: As a newly married couple, they may not have access to the same level of support and resources as single professionals, such as mentorship programs or professional organizations.

It's important to note that these challenges can vary depending on the individual circumstances of the couple, and there are many ways that newly married couples can overcome these challenges and succeed in their careers.
