Creating more inclusive community events for expectant masculine individuals requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that all attendees feel welcome and included. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities in event promotions, flyers, and other materials. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" or "women") and instead use terms like "expectant individuals," "pregnant people," or "parents-to-be."
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event space is wheelchair accessible and has gender-neutral restrooms. Provide accommodations such as seating areas or quiet spaces for those who may need them.
3. Gender-Neutral Promotions: Avoid using gendered language in promotional materials, such as "Dads and Moms" or "Mother's Day." Instead, use language that is inclusive of all expectant individuals, such as "Expectant Parents" or "Birthing Individuals."
4. Inclusive Programming: Offer a variety of activities and workshops that cater to the diverse needs and interests of attendees. For example, offer sessions on mindfulness, self-care, and parenting techniques that are inclusive of all genders.
5. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for expectant individuals to connect and share their experiences without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done through designated meetups or workshops where attendees can feel comfortable being themselves.
6. Partnership with LGBTQ+ Organizations: Collaborate with local LGBTQ+ organizations to promote the event and ensure that all are welcome. This will help to reach a wider audience and create a more inclusive environment.
7. Education and Training: Provide training and education for event staff and volunteers on how to create an inclusive environment for expectant individuals of all genders. This can include workshops on gender diversity, inclusion, and respectful language use.
8. Inclusive Swag: Offer swag bags or giveaways that are inclusive of all expectant individuals, such as onesies or t-shirts with gender-neutral designs. Avoid
