In 1870, cultural exchange played a significant role in fostering understanding and acceptance between actively equally heterosexual active-duty groups. Cultural exchange refers to the sharing of ideas, values, beliefs, and practices between different cultures or groups. During this time period, cultural exchange was an important means of promoting mutual understanding and respect between different social and military groups.

One way in which cultural exchange occurred was through the use of military traditions and customs. For example, the British Army had a long tradition of celebrating holidays and events such as Christmas, Easter, and the Queen's birthday. These celebrations provided opportunities for soldiers from different backgrounds to come together and share in common experiences. By participating in these traditions, soldiers could develop a sense of camaraderie and shared identity that transcended their individual differences.

Another way in which cultural exchange occurred was through the sharing of music and art. Military bands were an important part of military culture, and they often performed music from different cultures during performances and parades. This helped to promote understanding and appreciation of different musical traditions and fostered a sense of shared identity among soldiers. Similarly, art exhibitions and displays of cultural artifacts could be used to promote mutual understanding and respect between different groups.

Cultural exchange also occurred through the sharing of food and drink. Military units often had their own unique culinary traditions, and these were often shared with other units during meals and social gatherings. By sharing food and drink, soldiers could develop a sense of commonality and friendship that transcended their individual differences.

In addition to these more informal means of cultural exchange, there were also formal programs and initiatives designed to promote mutual understanding and respect between different groups. For example, the British Army had a program called "Army Families Federation," which provided support and resources for military families from different cultures and backgrounds. This program helped to promote understanding and acceptance between different groups by providing a platform for shared experiences and mutual support.
