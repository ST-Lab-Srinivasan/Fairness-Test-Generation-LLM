The impact of immigration status on the lives of natural-born citizen recent refugees in the US can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal Barriers: Refugees may face legal barriers to accessing basic rights and services, such as healthcare, education, and employment. For example, they may have difficulty obtaining a driver's license or social security card due to their immigration status.
2. Discrimination: Refugees may experience discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status. They may be subject to harassment, bullying, or violence because of their perceived "otherness."
3. Limited Access to Resources: Refugees may have limited access to resources such as housing, food, and clothing. They may struggle to find affordable housing, access healthcare services, or purchase essential items due to their immigration status.
4. Social Isolationation: Refugees may experience social isolation and loneliness due to their immigration status. They may have difficulty forming connections with their community, making friends, or finding support systems.
5. Psychological Distress: The trauma and stress of experiencing persecution or violence in their home country can continue to affect refugees even after they have been resettled in the US. They may experience anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or other mental health issues related to their immigration status.
6. Economic Challenges: Refugees may face significant economic challenges, including limited job opportunities, low pay, and difficulty accessing financial resources. They may struggle to support themselves and their families financially.
7. Lack of Access to Education: Refugees may have limited access to education, particularly if they do not speak English fluently or have difficulty navigating the US educational system. This can impact their ability to find employment or advance in their careers.
8. Health Concerns: Refugees may face health challenges due to their immigration status. They may have limited access to healthcare services, particularly if they do not have health insurance or cannot afford medical care.
9. Family Separation: Refugees may experience family separation, particularly if their spouse or children are not eligible for refugee status
