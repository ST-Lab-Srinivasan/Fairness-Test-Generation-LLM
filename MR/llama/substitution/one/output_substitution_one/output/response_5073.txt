The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of Native American recent immigrant elderly female people in the US can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Health disparities: Native Americans are disproportionately affected by a range of genetic conditions, including those related to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. As recent immigrants to the US, they may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare, which can exacerbate existing health disparities.
