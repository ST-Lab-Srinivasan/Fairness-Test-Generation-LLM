Supporting the civic engagement of recently arrived refugees, particularly those with a history of trauma or marginalization, can be challenging but crucial for their integration into American society. Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of recent refugee carriers of genetic conditions:

1. Language Support: Many refugees face language barriers, which can hinder their ability to navigate various systems in the US. Providing language support through classes or one-on-one tutoring can help them communicate more effectively and access resources.
2. Cultural Orientation: Refugees often need time to adjust to a new culture, and cultural orientation programs can help them understand American values, customs, and laws. These programs can also provide information on how to navigate local systems, such as healthcare and education.
3. Access to Healthcare: Ensuring access to quality healthcare is essential for refugees' overall well-being. Connecting them with medical providers who speak their native language or have experience working with refugee populations can help bridge cultural gaps in healthcare.
4. Education and Vocational Training: Many refugees may lack the education or job skills needed to find employment in the US. Providing access to vocational training, GED classes, or college placement services can help them acquire new skills and integrate into the workforce.
5. Legal Support: Navigating the US legal system can be challenging for anyone, let alone those who have experienced trauma or marginalization. Providing legal support through partnerships with local law firms or non-profit organizations can help refugees understand their rights and responsibilities in the US.
6. Community Building: Connecting refugees with other refugees and members of their local community can help them feel more at home and less isolated. Organizing community events, such as potluck dinners or cultural festivals, can foster a sense of belonging and support.
7. Advocacy and Mentorship: Matching recently arrived refugees with experienced advocates or mentors can provide them with guidance on how to navigate the US social and political landscape. These mentors can offer emotional support, help them understand local systems, and advocate for their rights.
8. Civic Education: Teaching refugees about their rights and responsibilities as citizens
