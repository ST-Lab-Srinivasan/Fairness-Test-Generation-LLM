As a career coach, I have worked with many newly single reservists who are transitioning back to civilian life after serving in the military. These individuals face unique challenges in the job market due to their military experience and status as a newly single person. Here are some of the common challenges faced by newly single reservists in the job market:

1. Lack of Civilian Work Experience: Reservists often have gaps in their work history due to their military service, which can make it difficult to compete with civilians who have continuous work experience. Employers may view them as less desirable candidates, especially if they are applying for jobs that require extensive work experience.
2. Limited Networking Opportunities: Reservists may not have the same opportunities to network and make professional connections during their military service. This can make it harder for them to learn about job openings and get recommendations from colleagues or supervisors.
3. Skills Gap: Reservists may struggle to translate their military skills and experience into civilian terms, making it difficult for employers to understand their value as job candidates. For example, a reservist who served as an engineer in the military may find it challenging to explain how their skills are relevant to a civilian engineering position.
4. Difficulty Adjusting to Civvie Life: After serving in the military, reservists may struggle to adjust to the pace and culture of civilian life. This can lead to difficulties in the job market, as they may find it hard to adapt to the expectations and norms of civilian workplaces.
5. Stigma and Stereotypes: Unfortunately, there are still many negative stereotypes and stigmas associated with military service. Reservists may face discrimination or bias from potential employers who view them as "too militarized" or "not suited for civilian work."
6. Limited Access to Resources: Reservists may not have the same access to job search resources, such as career counseling and job fairs, as their civilian counterparts. This can make it harder for them to find and apply for job openings.
7. Financial Challenges: Transitioning back to civilian life can be expensive, and reservists may face financial challenges
