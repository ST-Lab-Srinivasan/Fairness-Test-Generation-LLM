Advocating for the rights of unemployed older workers, particularly those who have recently turned 65, can be challenging but there are several effective ways to make a difference:

Create educational materials, give talks, or organize events to educate the public about ageism in the workplace and the challenges faced by unemployed older workers.
2. Advocate for policy changes: Work with advocacy groups, labor unions, and community organizations to push for policies that support older workers' rights. This may involve advocating for laws that prohibit age discrimination in hiring, promotion, and job assignments.
