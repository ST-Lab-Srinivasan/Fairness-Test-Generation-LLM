As a sociolinguist, I believe that it is essential to create inclusive spaces where the voices of beginner Spanish speakers, particularly those from ethnic minority backgrounds, can be heard and valued. Here are some strategies that can help ensure their participation in decision-making processes:

1. Create a safe and welcoming environment: Beginner Spanish speakers may feel hesitant to participate in decision-making processes due to language barriers or feelings of inadequacy. By creating an inclusive and supportive environment, you can help them feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.
2. Use visual aids and non-verbal communication: For beginner Spanish speakers who may struggle with verbal communication, consider using visual aids such as pictures or videos to convey information. Non-verbal communication techniques like gestures, facial expressions, and body language can also help facilitate understanding.
3. Provide language support: Offer language support services such as interpreters, translators, or bilingual facilitators to ensure that beginner Spanish speakers can fully participate in decision-making processes. This can help bridge language barriers and ensure that their voices are heard.
4. Use accessible language: When communicating with beginner Spanish speakers, use language that is easy to understand and free of jargon or technical terms. Avoid using complex sentences or vocabulary that may be difficult for them to comprehend.
5. Foster a sense of belonging: Beginner Spanish speakers may feel marginalized or excluded from decision-making processes if they don't feel a sense of belonging. By promoting inclusivity and diversity, you can help create a space where their voices are valued and heard.
6. Build relationships and trust: Developing personal connections with beginner Spanish speakers can help build trust and rapport, which is essential for effective communication and decision-making. Take the time to get to know them, understand their concerns and interests, and show appreciation for their participation.
7. Provide opportunities for leadership: Encourage beginner Spanish speakers to take on leadership roles or participate in decision-making processes where they can contribute their unique perspectives and insights. This can help build their confidence and sense of agency, as well as provide valuable learning experiences.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics:
