Lower middle-income recent refugees to Canada may face a range of challenges within the legal system. Some of the specific issues they may encounter include:

1. Lack of Legal Representation: Lower middle-income refugees may not be able to afford legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the Canadian legal system and ensure their rights are protected.
2. Language Barriers: Refugees may face language barriers in Canada, particularly if they do not speak English or French fluently. This can make it challenging for them to understand legal procedures and documents, which can lead to misunderstandings and mistakes.
3. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Lower middle-income refugees may have limited access to legal resources, such as law libraries or online legal databases. This can make it difficult for them to research and understand their rights and obligations under Canadian law.
4. Cultural Differences: Refugees may come from different cultural backgrounds and may have different expectations and beliefs about the legal system. This can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts with legal professionals or court officials.
5. Trauma and Stress: Many refugees have experienced trauma and stress in their home countries or during their journey to Canada. This can make it difficult for them to cope with the demands of the legal system, including attending court hearings and navigating complex legal procedures.
6. Lack of Knowledge about Canadian Laws and Procedures: Refugees may not be familiar with Canadian laws and procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
7. Limited Access to Support Services: Lower middle-income refugees may have limited access to support services such as mental health counseling, language training, or employment assistance. This can make it difficult for them to address the underlying issues that may affect their ability to navigate the legal system.
8. Discrimination and Bias: Refugees may face discrimination and bias within the legal system, particularly if they come from marginalized communities. This can lead to unequal treatment and outcomes in legal proceedings.
9. Difficulty in Proving Claims: Refugees may have difficulty proving their claims, particularly if they do not have documentary evidence or witnesses to support their stories
