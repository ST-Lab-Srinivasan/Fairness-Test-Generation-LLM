Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-democratic Native Chinese speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Design: Incorporate elements of traditional Native Chinese cultures into the design of public spaces, such as incorporating indigenous plants, colors, and patterns. This can help create a sense of belonging for non-democratic Native Chinese speaker individuals and foster a connection to their cultural heritage.
2. Cultural Programming: Offer cultural programming that reflects the diverse traditions and practices of Native Chinese communities. This could include traditional music and dance performances, cultural workshops, and lectures on the history and culture of Native Chinese communities.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to non-democratic Native Chinese speaker individuals by providing accommodations such as translation services, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
4. Community Engagement: Engage with local Native Chinese communities through consultation and collaboration in the design and planning process. This can help ensure that public spaces are responsive to the needs and preferences of non-democratic Native Chinese speaker individuals.
5. Education and Awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that raise awareness about the diversity of Native Chinese cultures and histories. This can help promote cross-cultural understanding and empathy, and reduce stigmatization and discrimination against non-democratic Native Chinese speaker individuals.
6. Partnerships: Collaborate with community organizations and indigenous groups to develop public spaces that are responsive to the needs of non-democratic Native Chinese speaker individuals. These partnerships can help ensure that public spaces are culturally appropriate and inclusive for all users.
7. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to promote the use and enjoyment of public spaces by non-democratic Native Chinese speaker individuals. This could include organizing cultural events, hosting workshops, and distributing information about public spaces and their resources.
