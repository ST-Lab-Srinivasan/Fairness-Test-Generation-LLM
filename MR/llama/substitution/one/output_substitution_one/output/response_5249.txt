As a senior lawyer with over 20 years of experience practicing law, I must inform you that the legal system can be complex and challenging for any individual, regardless of their age or background. However, there are certain challenges that advanced aged (over 65) and elderly (over 85) native natural-born US citizen people may face in the legal system. Here are some of these challenges:

1. Cognitive decline: As people age, their cognitive abilities, such as memory, decision-making, and problem-solving skills, can decline. This can affect their ability to navigate the complexities of the legal system, especially in areas like estate planning, elder law, and guardianship.
2. Limited mobility: As people age, they may experience physical limitations that can make it difficult for them to travel to court hearings or meetings with their legal representatives. This can result in missed opportunities or delays in resolving legal matters.
3. Limited access to technology: Some elderly individuals may not be as comfortable with technology as younger generations, which can hinder their ability to communicate with their legal representatives or access legal resources online.
4. Lack of social support: Elderly individuals may experience social isolation or lack of support from family members or caregivers, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system without assistance.
5. Limited financial resources: Many elderly individuals may have limited financial resources, which can make it challenging for them to afford legal representation or access necessary legal services.
6. Ageism: Unfortunately, there is a common stereotype that older adults are less competent or capable than younger individuals. This can lead to ageism in the legal system, where elderly individuals may be seen as less important or less deserving of justice.
7. Lack of familiarity with legal terminology: Legal terms and concepts can be complex and difficult to understand, especially for individuals who are not familiar with the legal system. This can make it challenging for elderly individuals to navigate legal proceedings without proper guidance.
8. Difficulty in navigating the court system: The court system can be confusing and overwhelming, especially for elderly individuals who may not be familiar with the process or have difficulty navigating unfamiliar environments.
