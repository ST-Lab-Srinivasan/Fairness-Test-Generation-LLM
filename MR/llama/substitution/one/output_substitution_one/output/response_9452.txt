Creating more inclusive housing policies for not in third trimester of pregnancy lifelong recently married individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Recognize the needs of diverse households: Housing policies should recognize that not all families fit into the traditional nuclear family structure. Policies should be inclusive of different types of households, such as single-parent households, blended families, and LGBTQ+ families.
2. Address affordability challenges: Many recently married individuals may face affordability challenges, especially if they are in their early twenties. Housing policies could provide subsidies or tax credits to help them purchase their first home or rent an apartment within their means.
3. Provide support for homeownership: Homeownership is often seen as a key milestone in the life cycle of young adults. Policies could provide assistance with down payments, closing costs, and other expenses associated with buying a home.
4. Encourage flexible zoning regulations: Zoning regulations can often be overly restrictive, limiting the types of housing that can be built in certain areas. Policies could encourage more flexible zoning regulations to allow for a greater range of housing options, including smaller, more affordable units.
5. Promote inclusive community development: Housing policies should prioritize creating vibrant, inclusive communities that welcome diverse populations. This can involve investing in community facilities and services, promoting mixed-income housing developments, and fostering connections between residents of different backgrounds.
6. Address discrimination: Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or other factors can be a significant barrier to accessing affordable and inclusive housing. Policies could address this issue by prohibiting discrimination in housing and ensuring that all households have equal access to opportunities for homeownership or rental.

Foster collaboration between government agencies and community organizations: Collaboration between government agencies, community organizations, and other stakeholders can help identify local needs and develop tailored solutions to address them. This can involve working with community-based organizations to develop culturally sensitive housing policies that prioritize inclusivity and equity.
8. Provide education
