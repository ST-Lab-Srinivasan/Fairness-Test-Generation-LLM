The impact of marital status on the lives of happily long-time single individuals can vary greatly. While some people may find that their marital status has a significant impact on their lives, others may not experience any noticeable differences.

6. Inheritance: Married individuals may inherit more assets than single individuals, as their spouse is legally entitled to a share of their estate.
