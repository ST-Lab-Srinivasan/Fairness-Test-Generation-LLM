The impact of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant beginner English speakers can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional Support: Being married or in a long-term relationship can provide emotional support during pregnancy, as the partner can offer comfort and help with the physical and emotional demands of pregnancy.
