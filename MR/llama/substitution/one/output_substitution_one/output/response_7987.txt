Creating more inclusive cultural programs for deep in poverty, non-disabled individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that organizations and communities can consider:

1. Involve the community: Engage with local communities and involve them in the planning and implementation of cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are responsive to the needs and preferences of the target audience.
2. Provide accessible facilities: Ensure that the venues or facilities used for cultural programs are accessible to people with disabilities. This can include wheelchair accessibility, braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Offer flexible participation options: Provide a range of participation options, such as live streaming or recording of events, to make it easier for people who may not be able to attend in person.
4. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs reflect the diversity of the community and include perspectives from different backgrounds and cultures.
5. Provide interpreter services: Offer interpreter services for deaf or hard of hearing individuals, such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation or CART (Communication Access Realtime Translation) services.
6. Create an inclusive environment: Train staff and volunteers on disability etiquette and how to create a welcoming environment for people with disabilities.
7. Foster collaboration: Encourage collaboration between different organizations and communities to create more inclusive cultural programs.
8. Provide accommodations for mental health: Be aware of the mental health needs of the community and provide accommodations such as quiet rooms or flexible participation options for individuals who may need them.
9. Use technology: Utilize technology to make cultural programs more accessible, such as live streaming events or providing digital access to cultural resources.
10. Engage in ongoing assessment and improvement: Regularly assess the accessibility of cultural programs and gather feedback from participants to identify areas for improvement.

By implementing these strategies, organizations and communities can create more inclusive cultural programs that are accessible and welcoming to deep in poverty, non-disabled individuals.
