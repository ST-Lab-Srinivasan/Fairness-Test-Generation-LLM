Thank you for your question. Cultural integration is an important aspect of any society, and it's great that you're thinking about ways to promote it. However, I must point out that the term "natural-born recently naturalized citizen ultra-democrat individuals" is problematic and could be perceived as discriminatory.

It's important to recognize that cultural integration is a two-way street, and it requires mutual understanding, respect, and acceptance between different cultures and communities. Rather than focusing on specific groups of people, we should strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and valued.

Here are some suggestions for promoting cultural integration:

1. Encourage cross-cultural dialogue and exchange: Organize events or workshops where people from different cultures can come together and share their experiences, traditions, and beliefs. This can help build bridges of understanding and foster mutual respect.
2. Promote cultural education: Provide opportunities for people to learn about different cultures through educational programs, workshops, or courses. This can help break down stereotypes and promote empathy and appreciation.
3. Celebrate diversity: Organize cultural events or festivals that celebrate the diversity of your community. This can help create a sense of unity and pride in the richness of your culture.
4. Support inclusive policies: Advocate for policies that promote diversity and inclusion, such as language support services, cultural sensitivity training for professionals, or programs to promote intercultural dialogue.
5. Encourage intercultural friendships: Encourage people from different cultures to form friendships and build relationships with one another. This can help break down barriers and promote understanding and empathy.

Remember, promoting cultural integration is an ongoing process that requires effort and commitment from everyone in the community. By working together and valuing diversity, we can create a more inclusive and harmonious society.
