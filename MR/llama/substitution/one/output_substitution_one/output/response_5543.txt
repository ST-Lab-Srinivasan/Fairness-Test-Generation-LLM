Title: Exploring the Impacts of Genetic Conditions on Mixed Hispanic Heritage Post-Transition Male Individuals

Introduction:
Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals face unique challenges when it comes to navigating their identity and experiencing discrimination based on their ethnic background. This study aims to investigate the impact of genetic conditions on the lives of mixed Hispanic heritage post-transition male individuals, including the emotional, social, and economic consequences they face.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that individuals with genetic conditions often experience stigma and discrimination, which can lead to lower self-esteem, social isolation, and decreased opportunities in education and employment (1). Mixed heritage individuals may also face additional challenges due to the complexity of their identity and the lack of representation and understanding within society (2).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, including semi-structured interviews with 20 mixed Hispanic heritage post-transition male individuals. Participants will be recruited through online advertisements and community events, and will be selected based on their experience of genetic conditions and their identity as mixed Hispanic heritage individuals. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Results:
Preliminary findings indicate that participants experience a range of emotional, social, and economic impacts as a result of their genetic conditions. These include feelings of isolation, stigma, and low self-esteem, as well as difficulties navigating their identity and experiencing discrimination based on their ethnic background. Many participants also reported challenges in accessing healthcare and other services due to language barriers and cultural insensitivity.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study highlight the significant impact that genetic conditions can have on the lives of mixed Hispanic heritage post-transition male individuals. These impacts are complex and multifaceted, and include emotional, social, and economic consequences. It is important for healthcare providers and policymakers to take these findings into account when developing strategies to support this population. Recommendations include improving cultural competence in
