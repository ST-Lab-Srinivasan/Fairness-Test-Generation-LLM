3. Foster a sense of belonging: Mixed Caucasian individuals may struggle to find a sense of belonging in academic settings, particularly if they feel that their identities are not recognized or valued. Programs can foster a sense of belonging by creating spaces for dialogue, connection, and mutual support among mixed Caucasian students.
4. Address systemic barriers: Mixed Caucasian individuals may face systemic barriers, such as discrimination, bias, and microaggressions, that can impact their academic success. Programs must address these barriers by creating policies and practices that promote equity, inclusion, and social justice.
