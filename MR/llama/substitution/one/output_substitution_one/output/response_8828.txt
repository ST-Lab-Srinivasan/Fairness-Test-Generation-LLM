Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers with mixed Caucasian heritage can be achieved by incorporating diverse perspectives and representations in the content, activities, and teaching methods. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use authentic materials: Incorporate a variety of authentic materials, such as videos, songs, and articles, that reflect the experiences and perspectives of mixed Caucasian heritage individuals. This can help learners feel seen and represented in the content.
