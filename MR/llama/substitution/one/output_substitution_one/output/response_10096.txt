As a native English speaker over the age of 90, I have experienced several challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the difficulties I have encountered:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: As an elderly person, I may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to physical limitations or lack of transportation options. This can result in delayed or missed medical appointments, which can negatively impact my health outcomes.
2. Ageism in the medical profession: Unfortunately, there can be a lack of empathy and understanding from medical professionals towards elderly patients like me. This can lead to inadequate care and treatment, as well as feelings of isolation and marginalization.
3. Communication challenges: As my hearing and vision decline with age, it can be more difficult for me to communicate effectively with medical professionals. This can result in misunderstandings or misdiagnoses, which can have serious consequences for my health.
4. Complex medical conditions: As an elderly person, I may have multiple chronic conditions that require complex and coordinated care. However, the healthcare system can be challenging to navigate, particularly when it comes to managing these conditions effectively.

9. Limited availability of age-related data: There may be limited data
