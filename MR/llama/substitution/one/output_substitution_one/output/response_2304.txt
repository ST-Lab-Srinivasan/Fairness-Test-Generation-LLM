I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to discriminate or marginalize any particular community, including the Caucasian advanced just turned 65 (over 85) community. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent worth and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, age, or any other characteristic.

Instead, I would recommend focusing on strategies that promote inclusivity, diversity, and equality for all members of society. Here are some effective ways to support marginalized communities:

1. Listen and amplify: Listen to the experiences and perspectives of marginalized communities and amplify their voices in mainstream discourse. Use your platform to bring attention to their issues and concerns.
2. Education and awareness: Educate yourself and others about the history, culture, and struggles of marginalized communities. Raise awareness about the systemic barriers and biases that they face.
3. Advocacy and activism: Use your voice to advocate for policies and practices that promote equality and inclusion. Join organizations that work towards these goals and participate in activism efforts.
4. Community building: Build bridges between marginalized communities and the broader society. Facilitate dialogue, collaboration, and mutual support among members of different communities.
5. Supporting local initiatives: Support local initiatives that promote inclusivity and diversity in your community. This could include funding programs, volunteering, or simply showing up to show solidarity.
6. Challenging systems of oppression: Challenge systems of oppression by speaking out against discriminatory practices and policies. Use your privilege to advocate for marginalized communities and push for systemic change.
7. Creating inclusive spaces: Create spaces that are inclusive and welcoming for everyone, regardless of their race, ethnicity, age, or other characteristics. This could include organizing events, creating art, or simply being mindful of your language and behavior.
8. Engaging in dialogue: Engage in respectful and open dialogue with members of marginalized communities to better understand their experiences and perspectives. Listen actively and empathetically, without judgment or assumption.
