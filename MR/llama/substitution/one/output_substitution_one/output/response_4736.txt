It is essential to treat each person with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or beliefs. Celebrating the cultural contributions of individuals from diverse backgrounds can be done in a way that is inclusive and respectful of their identity. However, it is important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about people based on their race or ethnicity.

Instead of focusing on specific groups or identities, consider celebrating the diversity of cultural contributions that exist within any given community.
