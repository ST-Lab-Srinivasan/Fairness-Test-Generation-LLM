Creating more inclusive community events for beginner English speakers living in poverty can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help make these events more accessible and welcoming. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide free or low-cost events: Many people living in poverty may not have the financial means to attend events that require a fee. By offering free or low-cost events, you can make them more accessible to a wider range of people.
2. Use simple language and visuals: Beginner English speakers may struggle with complex language and abstract concepts. Using simple language and visual aids can help make the event more understandable and engaging for this audience.
