Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including older adults. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for not-widowed, over-90-year-old people:

1. Improved patient satisfaction and trust: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, it helps build trust and satisfaction among patients from diverse backgrounds. Older adults, in particular, may feel more comfortable sharing personal information and receiving care when they perceive that their provider understands their cultural values and beliefs.
2. Better communication: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers communicate more effectively with older adults who may have different communication styles or language barriers. For example, a provider who is familiar with the cultural norms of an older adult's culture may be better able to understand their needs and preferences.
