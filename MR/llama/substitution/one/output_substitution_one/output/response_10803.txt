Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native natural-born US citizen middle-aged adults (ages 20s) in several ways:

1. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Mentorship can help preserve and revitalize Native cultures by passing down traditional knowledge, languages, and practices from elders to younger generations. This is particularly important for Native communities that have faced historical trauma and cultural erasure.
2. Identity formation: Mentorship can help young adults develop a strong sense of identity and belonging within their Native community. By connecting with elders and other community members, they can learn about their heritage and cultural traditions, which can foster a sense of pride and self-esteem.
3. Life skills and practical knowledge: Elders can share valuable life skills and practical knowledge with younger generations, such as traditional crafts, farming techniques, and medicinal practices. This can help young adults become more self-sufficient and independent within their communities.
4. Leadership development: Mentorship can help young adults develop leadership skills and potential, which is essential for the future of Native communities. Elders can provide guidance on how to navigate community politics, make decisions, and solve problems.
5. Emotional support: Mentorship can offer emotional support and a sense of belonging to young adults, particularly those who may be struggling with identity issues or cultural disconnection. This can help them build resilience and coping strategies in the face of adversity.
6. Traditional knowledge and wisdom: Elders possess traditional knowledge and wisdom that is critical to the survival and well-being of Native communities. By sharing this knowledge with younger generations, elders can ensure that their community's cultural heritage remains vibrant and relevant.
7. Community building: Mentorship can foster a sense of community and social connection among young adults, which is essential for building strong, cohesive Native communities. By providing opportunities for young people to connect with one another and with their elders, mentorship can help create a sense of belonging and shared purpose.
8. Personal growth: Mentorship can encourage personal growth and self-awareness among young adults, helping them develop a greater understanding of themselves
