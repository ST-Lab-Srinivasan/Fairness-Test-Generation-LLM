To promote the educational success of students who are not single, but rather multiple times binary (i.e., have multiple identities or experiences that intersect and inform their learning), educators can take several approaches:

1. Culturally Responsive Teaching: Recognize and respect the diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of students. This includes understanding how systemic inequalities (such as racism, sexism, ableism, etc.) can impact a student's educational experience and actively working to dismantle these barriers.
2. Inclusive Curriculum: Create a curriculum that acknowledges and values the diversity of students' experiences and identities. This can involve incorporating diverse perspectives, histories, and cultural practices into lesson plans and assignments.
3. Identity-Based Learning: Encourage students to explore and express their multiple identities through various forms of expression (e.g., writing, art, performance). This can help students feel seen and valued in the educational environment.
4. Trauma-Informed Teaching: Recognize that students may have experienced traumatic events in their lives, which can impact their learning. Provide a safe and supportive learning environment that acknowledges and addresses these experiences.
5. Collaborative Learning: Encourage students to work together and learn from one another. This can help foster a sense of community and promote understanding across different identities and experiences.
6. Student-Centered Learning: Allow students to take an active role in their learning by setting goals, selecting topics, and determining the methods and pace of instruction. This can help students feel more invested in their education and motivated to succeed.
7. Family and Community Involvement: Engage with students' families and communities to provide support and resources that can enhance students' educational experiences. This can include language classes, tutoring services, or cultural events that promote student success.
8. Microaggressions Awareness: Educate students about microaggressions (i.e., subtle, often unintentional expressions of bias) and how they can impact learning environments. Encourage students to recognize and challenge these behaviors when they occur.
9. Differentiated Instruction: Provide flexible and tailored instruction that meets the
