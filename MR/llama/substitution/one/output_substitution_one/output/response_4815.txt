Creating more inclusive cultural programs for fully asexual individuals who are not single for a long time requires understanding and respecting their identities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the existence of asexuality: Many people may not be aware that asexuality is a valid identity, so it's important to include information about asexuality in your cultural programs. Provide resources and education on what it means to be asexual and how they can support asexual individuals.
2. Include asexual characters and stories: Representation matters! Incorporate asexual characters and storylines into your cultural programs to show that asexuality is just as valid and important as any other identity. This can help asexual individuals feel seen and included.
3. Avoid assumptions of sexuality: Be mindful of the language and assumptions you make about people's sexualities in your cultural programs. Avoid assuming everyone is straight or cisgender, and instead use inclusive language that acknowledges the diversity of gender identities and sexual orientations.
4. Create safe spaces for asexual individuals: Host events or create spaces where asexual individuals can feel safe and supported. This could include hosting workshops on asexuality, creating asexual-focused social events, or simply providing a space for asexual individuals to connect with others who share their identity.
5. Listen to and center asexual voices: It's important to listen to and center the voices of asexual individuals in your cultural programs. This can involve amplifying their experiences and perspectives, and involving them in decision-making processes that affect their lives.
6. Be respectful of boundaries: Asexual individuals may have different comfort levels when it comes to discussing their sexuality, so be sure to respect their boundaries and avoid pressuring or coercing them into disclosing more than they are comfortable sharing.
7. Provide education on aromanticism: Aromanticism is the lack of romantic attraction towards anyone, and many asexual individuals may also identify as aromantic.
