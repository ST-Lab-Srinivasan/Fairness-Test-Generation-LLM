Ensuring the healthcare needs of recent refugees in India, particularly those who are low-income earners, can be a significant challenge. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Healthcare Services: One of the primary challenges faced by refugees is access to healthcare services. Governments and NGOs should work together to establish healthcare facilities in or near refugee settlements, with trained medical professionals and adequate equipment. Mobile health clinics can also be used to reach remote areas where access to healthcare is limited.
2. Financial Support: Many refugees struggle to afford basic healthcare services due to their low income. Governments and NGOs can provide financial support to cover the costs of healthcare, including out-of-pocket expenses for medication, hospitalization, and other medical needs.
3. Health Promotion and Disease Prevention: Refugees often face significant health challenges due to their living conditions and lack of access to basic amenities. Health promotion and disease prevention programs can be implemented to educate refugees on maintaining good hygiene practices, proper nutrition, and early detection of illnesses.
4. Community Outreach: Building trust and rapport with the refugee community is crucial for providing effective healthcare services. Community outreach programs can help to establish relationships with refugees and increase their awareness of available healthcare services.

Additionally, building local capacity by training and equipping community health workers can help improve access to healthcare services.

7. Addressing Mental Health Needs: Refugees often experience significant psychological trauma due to their experiences, leading to mental health challenges. Ensuring access to mental health services, such as counseling and psychotherapy, can help refugees cope with these challeng
