The impact of marital status on the lives of beginner English speakers, particularly male-identifying individuals, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Married individuals may face social isolation due to their spouse's schedules and priorities. Beginner English speakers may struggle to find time for language learning and practice, leading to a decrease in proficiency.
2. Gender roles and expectations: In some cultures, gender roles and expectations can impact the learning process. Male-identifying individuals may face societal pressure to prioritize work and provider duties over personal growth and development. This could lead to reduced motivation for language learning.

4. Childcare responsibilities: Beginner English speakers with children may struggle to balance childcare and language learning. This can lead to reduced practice opportunities and a slower progression in language proficiency.
5. Social support: Married individuals may have fewer opportunities for social interaction, which can negatively impact language learning. Limited opportunities for practicing speaking and listening skills can slow progress.
