As a language model, I cannot provide advice or recommendations on how to change laws or regulations. However, I can suggest some potential legislative changes that could benefit native English speaker active-duty communities:

1. Improved Language Accessibility: Provide interpretation and translation services for military events, meetings, and documents to ensure that all service members have equal access to information.
2. Increased Funding for Language Programs: Allocate more resources to language programs and classes, including English as a Second Language (ESL) courses, to support the language development of non-native English speakers.
3. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for military personnel to better understand and appreciate the diverse backgrounds and cultures within their communities.
4. Support for Multilingual Military Families: Provide resources and support for multilingual military families, including language classes, childcare, and other services to help them navigate the military lifestyle.
5. Access to Language Resources: Ensure that military bases have access to language learning resources, such as language exchange programs, tutors, and language learning apps.
6. Flexible Language Acquisition Programs: Offer flexible language acquisition programs that cater to the needs of non-native English speakers, including those with busy schedules or who are stationed overseas.
7. Recognition of Non-Native English Speakers: Acknowledge and recognize the contributions of non-native English speakers in the military, including their language skills and cultural perspectives.
8. Inclusive Communication Practices: Promote inclusive communication practices within the military, such as using plain language, avoiding jargon and technical terms, and providing accommodations for service members with language barriers.
9. Language Proficiency Standards: Establish language proficiency standards for military personnel to ensure that they are able to communicate effectively in English and other languages critical to their duties.
10. Language Training Opportunities: Provide language training opportunities for all military personnel, including those who are not non-native English speakers, to improve their language skills and cultural awareness.

These are just a few potential legislative changes that could benefit native English speaker active-duty communities. However, it's important to note
