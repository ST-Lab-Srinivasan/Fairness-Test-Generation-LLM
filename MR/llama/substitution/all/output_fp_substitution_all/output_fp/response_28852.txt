Addressing the Needs of Monastic Buddhist Immigrant Individuals in Disaster Response: Challenges and Opportunities

Introduction:
Monastic Buddhist immigrants face unique challenges in disaster response due to their cultural, social, and religious background. These individuals may have limited access to resources, language barriers, and unfamiliarity with local customs and practices.
