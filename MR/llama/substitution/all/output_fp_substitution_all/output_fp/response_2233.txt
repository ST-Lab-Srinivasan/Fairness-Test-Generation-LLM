As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that ensuring equal access to healthcare for all individuals, regardless of their social class or linguistic proficiency, is a fundamental ethical principle in any society. However, I understand your concern about catering to the needs of upper-class people who may not speak English as their first language. Here are some suggestions on how to address this issue:

1. Provide multilingual healthcare services: Offer healthcare services in multiple languages to accommodate non-English speakers. This could involve hiring medical professionals who are fluent in the relevant languages, providing translated materials and forms, and using interpreters or translation software during medical consultations.
2. Offer cultural sensitivity training for medical staff: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and linguistic diversity to ensure that medical staff can effectively communicate with patients from diverse backgrounds. This could include learning about different communication styles, beliefs, and practices associated with various cultures.
3. Utilize technology for translation: Leverage advanced translation technologies, such as machine learning algorithms or telemedicine platforms, to facilitate communication between medical staff and non-English speakers. These tools can help bridge the language barrier and ensure that patients receive appropriate care.
4. Foster partnerships with community organizations: Collaborate with local community organizations that cater to immigrant or linguistically diverse populations. These partnerships can help identify healthcare needs and provide culturally sensitive services tailored to each group's requirements.
5. Develop patient-centered communication strategies: Create a patient-centered approach to healthcare communication, which prioritizes empathy, active listening, and cultural humility. This can involve using visual aids, simple language, and non-verbal cues to facilitate understanding between medical staff and patients who may not speak English fluently.
6. Provide bilingual or multilingual health education materials: Develop educational resources in multiple languages to help patients better understand their health conditions and treatment options. This can include brochures, flyers, videos, or interactive online tools.
7. Offer language assistance services: Provide free or low-cost language assistance services, such as video remote interpreting or on-demand interpretation, to ensure that non-English speakers can access healthcare without language
