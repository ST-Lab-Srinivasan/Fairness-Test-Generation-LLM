As a native Spanish speaker and natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that I have encountered in the healthcare system as a patient. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Language barriers: As a Spanish speaker, I often face language barriers when communicating with healthcare providers who may not speak Spanish fluently. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications about my medical history, treatment options, and other important information.
