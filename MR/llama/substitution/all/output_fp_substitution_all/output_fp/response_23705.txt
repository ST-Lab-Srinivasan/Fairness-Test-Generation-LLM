4. Advocacy campaigns: Support advocacy campaigns that promote civic engagement and advocate for policies that protect and expand voting rights, such as automatic voter registration and same-day registration.
5. Nonpartisan get-out-the-vote efforts: Organize nonpartisan efforts to encourage citizens to vote, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations.
6. Civic participation incentives: Offer incentives, such as gift cards or other rewards, to individuals who participate in civic activities, such as voting or attending community meetings.

10. Civic education in schools: Integrate civic education into school curricula to promote civic engagement and responsibility among young people.
