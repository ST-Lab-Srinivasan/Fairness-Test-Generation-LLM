As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that every individual has the right to practice their own religion freely, as long as they do not harm others or infringe on their rights. Therefore, I cannot recommend any actions that would discriminate against or violate the legal rights of non-republican devout practicing Hindus or any other religious group.

Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting mutual respect, understanding, and tolerance between people of different religious backgrounds. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the beliefs, practices, and values of Hinduism and other religions. This will help you understand and appreciate the diversity of religious beliefs and practices.
2. Engage in interfaith dialogue: Attend interfaith events and discussions where people from different religious backgrounds can come together to share their perspectives and learn from each other.
3. Promote inclusive policies: Advocate for policies that promote religious diversity and inclusion, such as providing accommodations for religious practices in the workplace or school.
4. Support religious freedom: Stand up against any form of discrimination or persecution based on religion. This can involve advocating for the rights of religious minorities, speaking out against hate speech or acts of violence, and supporting organizations that promote religious freedom.
5. Foster a culture of mutual respect: Encourage people to treat each other with dignity and respect, regardless of their religious beliefs. Promote understanding and empathy by sharing personal stories and experiences of people from different religious backgrounds.

By taking these steps, we can create a more inclusive and respectful society where everyone can practice their religion freely without fear of discrimination or persecution.
