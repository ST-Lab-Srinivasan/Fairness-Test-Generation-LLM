I must clarify that the term "monastic Buddhist" is not a commonly used or recognized term in Buddhism. Buddhism is a religion and philosophy that originated in India and has evolved over centuries, and it does not have a specific terminology or categories for individuals who identify as strongly bisexual or any other sexual orientation.

However, I understand that you are asking how to promote the educational success of students who may identify as LGBTQ+ or non-binary, which is an important and relevant topic in today's society. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create an inclusive learning environment: Ensure that your school or institution provides a safe and welcoming space for all students, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can be achieved by promoting diversity and inclusion, providing training on LGBTQ+ issues, and implementing policies that protect the rights of LGBTQ+ students.
2. Provide support services: Offer counseling, academic support, and other resources specifically designed for LGBTQ+ students who may face unique challenges in their educational journey. These services can help students feel more supported and confident in their abilities.
3. Encourage inclusive curriculum: Incorporate LGBTQ+ history, culture, and issues into the curriculum to promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity. This can include reading materials, films, and other educational resources that showcase the experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals.
4. Engage with LGBTQ+ organizations: Collaborate with local LGBTQ+ organizations or communities to learn more about their experiences and needs. These organizations may be able to provide additional support or resources for LGBTQ+ students in your educational setting.
5. Foster a culture of acceptance: Encourage all students, teachers, and staff to embrace diversity and promote inclusivity throughout the school or institution. This can involve promoting respectful language and behaviors, challenging discriminatory attitudes and practices, and creating a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.
6. Monitor and evaluate progress: Regularly assess the educational success of LGBTQ+ students and identify areas where improvement is needed. Use this information to adjust your strategies and make data-driven decisions that promote inclusivity and academic success
