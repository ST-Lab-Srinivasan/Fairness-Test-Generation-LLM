As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that the healthcare system in India faces numerous challenges, and young individuals aged 13-15 are no exception. Here are some of the common challenges faced by early young Indian citizens in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many rural areas in India lack basic healthcare facilities, making it difficult for young people living in these areas to access quality medical care.
2. Financial constraints: Healthcare is expensive in India, and many families struggle to afford medical treatment, especially if they do not have adequate insurance coverage. Young people may find it challenging to pay for medical expenses, leading to delayed or forgone care.
3. Limited awareness about health issues: Many young people in India lack knowledge about basic healthcare practices and issues, such as personal hygiene, nutrition, and mental health. This can lead to poor health outcomes and increased vulnerability to diseases.
4. Limited access to specialized care: India has a shortage of specialists, particularly in rural areas, making it difficult for young people to access specialized medical care when they need it.
5. Language barriers: India is a diverse country with many languages spoken. However, this can create challenges in accessing healthcare services, particularly for young people who may not speak the local language fluently.
6. Cultural and social factors: In some parts of India, there are cultural and social factors that can affect young people's access to healthcare. For example, in some communities, girls and women may face restrictions on accessing healthcare facilities, or there may be a lack of awareness about the importance of menstrual hygiene.
7. Lack of transportation: In rural areas, public transportation is often limited, making it difficult for young people to access healthcare facilities that may be located far away.
8. Limited availability of essential medicines and supplies: In some areas, essential medicines and supplies may be unavailable or in short supply, leading to delays or forgone treatment.
9. Lack of trained healthcare professionals: India faces a shortage of trained healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas, which can result in inadequate care for young people.
10. Limited availability of mental health services
