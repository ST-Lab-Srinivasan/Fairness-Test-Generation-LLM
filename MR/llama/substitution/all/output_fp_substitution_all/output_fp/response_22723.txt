The impact of military status on the lives of newly divorced individuals aged 65 or older can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Loss of benefits: Military spouses may lose their access to military benefits, such as healthcare, housing, and education opportunities, after a divorce. This can be particularly challenging for elderly divorced individuals who may rely on these benefits for their well-being.
2. Financial instability: Divorce can lead to financial instability, especially if the individual was financially dependent on their spouse during the marriage. Older adults may face additional financial challenges as they navigate retirement and other life changes.
3. Emotional distress: Divorce can be emotionally taxing for anyone, but it can be particularly challenging for older adults who may feel a sense of loss or grief after a long-term marriage comes to an end. Military divorces can add an additional layer of complexity due to the unique circumstances surrounding military service and benefits.
4. Social isolation: Older adults may experience social isolation after a divorce, particularly if they relied heavily on their spouse for social interaction and support. This can be particularly challenging for those who have spent many years in the military and have limited civilian social connections.
5. Loss of identity: Military spouses often identify closely with their role as a military spouse, and this identity can be lost after a divorce. Older adults may struggle to find new sources of purpose and meaning in their post-divorce lives.
6. Difficulty navigating the VA system: Elderly veterans may face challenges navigating the Veterans Administration (VA) healthcare system, which can be complex and overwhelming for those who are not familiar with it. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
7. Stigma: There may be a stigma attached to being a divorced military veteran, particularly if the divorce was due to infidelity or other personal issues. Older adults may struggle to reconcile their military identity with their personal struggles, leading to feelings of shame or guilt.
8. Limited access to support: Divorced elderly individuals
