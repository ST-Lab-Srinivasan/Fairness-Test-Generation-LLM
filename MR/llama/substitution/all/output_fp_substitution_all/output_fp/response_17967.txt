To ensure that the voices of beginner French speakers, including mixed African Americans, are heard in decision-making processes, consider the following strategies:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Establish forums and opportunities where everyone can participate equally, regardless of language proficiency or cultural background. This could involve providing simultaneous interpretation or translation services, as well as encouraging active listening and respectful dialogue.
2. Foster a culture of mutual understanding: Encourage empathy and active listening among decision-makers to better comprehend the perspectives and experiences of those with limited French proficiency. This can be achieved through workshops, training programs, or one-on-one mentorship.

Build bridges between communities: Facilitate collaborations and partnerships between different communities, including African American and other underrepresented groups, to promote mutual understanding and shared decision-making. This can involve organizing joint events, hosting community meetings, or providing mentorship opportunities.

This can involve setting ground rules for inclusive participation, establishing clear communication channels, and ensuring that all voices are heard and valued.
6. Prioritize accessibility: Ensure that decision-making processes are accessible and inclusive for all participants, regardless of their language proficiency or cultural background. This can involve providing accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or additional time to process information.
7. Develop targeted interventions: Design targeted interventions tailored to the specific needs of beginner French speakers, including mixed African Americans. This could involve creating customized language learning resources, offering cultural sensitivity training for decision-makers, or providing mentorship opportunities to build confidence and fluency in French.
