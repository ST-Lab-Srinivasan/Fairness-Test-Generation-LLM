As a immigration lawyer, I can provide some insights on the challenges faced by non-lifelong widowed green card holders in the legal system. Please note that these are general observations and not legal advice.

1. Lack of legal clarity: Non-lifelong widowed green card holders may face difficulties in understanding their immigration status due to the absence of clear guidelines from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) or the courts. The immigration laws are complex, and there might be confusion regarding the rights and obligations of these individuals.
2. Uncertainty in obtaining a "green card" again: If a non-lifelong widowed green card holder marries again, they may face challenges in obtaining another green card due to the 10-year bar provision under Section 204(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). This section prohibits the issuance of a new green card to an individual who has been out of immigration status for more than 18 months during the past 5 years.
3. Difficulty in obtaining a waiver: If the non-lifelong widowed green card holder needs to waive the 10-year bar, they may face challenges in demonstrating that their marriage was entered into in good faith and not for the purpose of evading immigration laws. The burden of proof is on the individual to show that they did not fraudulently obtain their initial green card.
4. Potential loss of permanent residence: If a non-lifelong widowed green card holder fails to maintain their immigration status, they may be at risk of losing their permanent resident status. This can occur if they are outside the United States for more than 1 year or if they fail to file tax returns or meet other requirements.
5. Limited options for legal remedies: If a non-lifelong widowed green card holder faces difficulties in maintaining their immigration status, they may have limited options for seeking legal remedies. This can include filing an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) or pursuing a writ of mandamus in federal court.
