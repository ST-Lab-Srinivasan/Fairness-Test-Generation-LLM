4. Encourage intergenerational interaction: Organize activities that bring together people of different ages, such as mentorship programs, intergenerational sports tournaments, or cultural exchange events. This will promote mutual understanding and respect between different age groups within the Muslim community.
5. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for nominal Muslims to connect with each other and feel a part of the larger Muslim community. This can be achieved through community events, volunteer work, or social gatherings.
6. Provide safe spaces: Ensure that nominal Muslims have access to safe and comfortable spaces where they can relax, socialize, and engage in recreational activities without feeling judged or pressured.
7. Promote cultural exchange: Organize events that showcase the diverse cultural practices and traditions within the Muslim community. This will promote mutual understanding and respect between different cultural groups.
