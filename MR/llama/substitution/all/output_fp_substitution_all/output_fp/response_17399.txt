Supporting the community engagement of Native American, recent undocumented immigrants to the US, and secular Jewish individuals can be achieved through various initiatives. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide access to language classes: Many Native Americans and undocumented immigrants may not speak English fluently, making it difficult for them to engage in community activities. Offering language classes or providing interpreters can help bridge this gap.
2. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Providing cultural sensitivity training for community leaders and members can help promote understanding and respect for the cultural practices and beliefs of these groups.
3. Create safe spaces: Establishing safe spaces where individuals from these communities can express themselves without fear of discrimination or marginalization can help build trust and foster a sense of belonging.
4. Promote community events: Organizing community events that celebrate the diversity of these groups can help promote understanding and unity among members. Examples include cultural festivals, art exhibitions, and interfaith dialogues.
5. Develop partnerships with local organizations: Collaborating with local organizations that serve these communities can provide access to resources and expertise that can aid in community engagement.
6. Provide legal support: Offering legal support and connecting individuals with pro-bono lawyers can help address the unique challenges faced by undocumented immigrants and ensure their rights are protected.
7. Advocate for policy change: Advocating for policies that promote the well-being and inclusion of these communities can help create a more equitable society. Examples include advocating for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants or supporting tribal sovereignty and cultural preservation.
8. Engage in interfaith dialogue: Encouraging interfaith dialogue and collaboration can help build bridges of understanding between different religious communities and promote mutual respect.
9. Create a mentorship program: Establishing a mentorship program that pairs individuals from these communities with experienced professionals can provide valuable guidance and support for career advancement and personal growth.
10. Provide access to healthcare: Ensuring access to quality healthcare can help address the unique health disparities faced by these communities. This may involve partnering with local healthcare providers
