1. Language Exchange Programs: Organize language exchange programs where beginner English speakers can practice their language skills with native English speakers. This will provide them with an opportunity to interact with others and improve their communication skills.
2. Social Events: Host social events specifically designed for beginner English speakers, such as potluck dinners, game nights, or movie nights. These events can help them meet new people and feel more comfortable in a social setting.

These groups can provide a safe space for them to share their experiences and emotions, as well as receive support and advice from others who are going through similar situations.
5. Online Communities: Create online communities or forums where beginner English speakers can connect with others who share similar language learning goals and experiences. This can help them feel less isolated and more connected to others.
6. Language Classes: Encourage beginner English speakers to enroll in language classes specifically designed for beginners. These classes can provide a structured environment where they can learn the language and interact with other students who are at similar levels of proficiency.
7. Cultural Events: Attend cultural events and festivals that celebrate diverse cultures and traditions. This can help beginner English speakers learn about different customs and practices, as well as meet people from different backgrounds.
8. Mentorship Programs: Pair beginner English speakers with more proficient language learners who can act as mentors and provide guidance and support throughout the learning process.
