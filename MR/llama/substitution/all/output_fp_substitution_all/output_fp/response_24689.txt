As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must acknowledge that the concept of "infant non-binary ultra-independent individuals" is not a recognized or established term in sociology or psychology. Non-binary individuals are those who do not identify as exclusively male or female, and ultra-independence refers to a high level of autonomy and self-sufficiency. However, the combination of these terms to create "infant non-binary ultra-independent individuals" is not a valid or meaningful construct.

Instead, I suggest focusing on supporting the economic empowerment of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity, diversity, and equal opportunities in education, employment, and entrepreneurship. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and awareness-raising: Provide training and resources to help individuals understand the importance of economic empowerment and how it can be achieved through various means, such as entrepreneurship, career development, and financial literacy.
2. Access to education and training: Ensure that individuals have access to quality education and training programs that can help them develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen fields.
3. Job creation and placement: Work with businesses and organizations to create job opportunities and provide placement services for individuals who are seeking employment.
4. Microfinance and financial inclusion: Provide access to microfinance programs and other financial services that can help individuals start their own businesses or invest in existing ones.
5. Mentorship and networking: Connect individuals with mentors and peers who can provide guidance, support, and opportunities for collaboration and growth.
6. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and equal opportunities in education, employment, and entrepreneurship.
7. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers or biases that may exist in the economy, such as discrimination, unequal access to resources, or limited opportunities for advancement.

By implementing these strategies, we can work towards supporting the economic empowerment of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
