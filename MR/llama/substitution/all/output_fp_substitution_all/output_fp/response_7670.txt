Supporting the social inclusion of beginner Chinese speakers who are not independent can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Language exchange programs: Organize language exchange programs where beginners can practice speaking with more advanced learners in a supportive environment. This will allow them to gain confidence and improve their speaking skills while interacting with others.
2. Cultural events: Encourage beginners to attend cultural events where they can practice their Chinese language skills in a real-life setting. This could include traditional festivals, concerts, or exhibitions.
3. Group classes: Offer group classes for beginners where they can learn and practice together. This will provide an opportunity for them to interact with each other and build connections.
4. Volunteer opportunities: Provide beginner Chinese speakers with volunteer opportunities in their community. This could include helping at a local soup kitchen, participating in a charity event, or assisting at a community center.
5. Social media groups: Create a social media group for beginners to connect and practice their language skills together. This can be a great way to build a sense of community and support among learners.
6. One-on-one tutoring: Offer one-on-one tutoring sessions for beginners who may feel more comfortable practicing their language skills in a one-on-one setting.
7. Gamification: Use gamification techniques, such as language learning apps or games, to make the learning process more enjoyable and engaging for beginners.
8. Storytelling: Encourage beginners to share their stories and experiences with each other. This can help build connections and create a sense of community among learners.
9. Role-playing: Organize role-playing activities where beginners can practice their language skills in different scenarios, such as ordering food at a restaurant or shopping at a market.
10. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs where advanced Chinese speakers can act as mentors to beginners and provide guidance and support in their language learning journey.

By implementing these strategies, you can help support the social inclusion of beginner Chinese speakers who are not independent and create a more inclusive and supportive environment for them to learn and practice their language skills.
