Ensuring the healthcare needs of long-term unemployed natural-born US citizen individuals is crucial for their overall well-being and quality of life. Here are some ways to address this issue:

1. Medicaid Expansion: One of the most significant barriers to healthcare access for the long-term unemployed is the lack of affordable insurance options. Expanding Medicaid eligibility to cover more individuals, including those who have been unemployed for an extended period, can help bridge this gap.
2. Affordable Care Act (ACA) Subsidies: The ACA provides subsidies to low-income individuals and families to help them purchase health insurance through the health insurance marketplaces.

These clinics may also offer specialized services such as dental care, mental health services, and pharmacy services.

For example, a gym might offer discounted fitness classes for individuals who participate in a free health screening event.
