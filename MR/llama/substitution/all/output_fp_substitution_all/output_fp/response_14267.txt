Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty seeking employment individuals can be a challenging task, but there are several steps that can be taken to make these events more accessible and welcoming. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their military status. Avoid using terms like "veterans only" or "active-duty personnel" and instead use language that includes everyone, such as "military members and veterans."
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event location and materials are accessible to people with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, and audio descriptions for visual content.
3. Scheduling: Be considerate of the schedules of military members and veterans who may have conflicting commitments. Offer events at times that are convenient for them, such as during evening hours or on weekends.
4. Advertising: Advertise the event widely to reach a diverse audience. Use social media platforms, local newspapers, and community newsletters to promote the event.
5. Outreach: Reach out to local military organizations, veterans' groups, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) to promote the event and encourage participation.
6. Childcare and Transportation: Provide childcare services or transportation options for attendees who may have difficulty accessing the event location.
7. Inclusive Programming: Offer a diverse range of programming that caters to different interests and needs. This can include workshops on job searching, resume building, and interviewing skills, as well as networking opportunities with potential employers.
8. Partnerships: Collaborate with local businesses and organizations to provide resources and support for active-duty seeking employment individuals.
9. Volunteer Opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities for military members and veterans to gain work experience and build their networks.
10. Follow-up: After the event, follow up with attendees to provide support and resources, and to gather feedback for future events.

By implementing these strategies, community events can become more inclusive and welcoming for
