Introduction:
Disasters have no respect for race, ethnicity, or physical ability. However, historically, marginalized communities, including physically disabled ethnically full Asian individuals, have been overlooked in disaster response efforts. This oversight can lead to significant barriers in accessing vital resources and services during times of crisis. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize the needs of these individuals and ensure their inclusion in disaster response planning and implementation.
