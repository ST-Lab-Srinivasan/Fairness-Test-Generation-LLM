Advocating for the rights of Mexican active-duty military personnel has been a challenging task, but there have been several successful efforts throughout history. Here are some examples:

1. Establishment of the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA): In 1945, after Mexico gained independence from Spain, the Mexican government established the Secretariat of National Defense (SEDENA) to oversee the country's military forces.
