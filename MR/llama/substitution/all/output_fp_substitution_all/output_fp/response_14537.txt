Ensuring that the voices of Orthodox Jewish individuals, particularly those in their third trimester of pregnancy, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging due to various cultural and religious factors. Here are some potential strategies that could help:

1. Build relationships and trust: Establishing trust and rapport with the Orthodox Jewish community is crucial for building a platform for their voices to be heard. This can be done by engaging in open and respectful dialogue, listening to their concerns, and demonstrating a commitment to understanding their perspectives.
2. Create safe spaces: Designate spaces where Orthodox Jewish individuals feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. These spaces can be physical or virtual, and can be used for discussions, workshops, or other activities that foster collaboration and mutual understanding.
3. Empower community leaders: Identify respected community leaders within the Orthodox Jewish community who are willing to advocate for their peers' voices to be heard. These leaders can help bridge gaps between the community and decision-makers, ensuring that the community's concerns are represented in decision-making processes.
4. Use storytelling techniques: Utilize storytelling methods to convey the experiences and challenges faced by Orthodox Jewish individuals, particularly during pregnancy. This can help decision-makers empathize with the community and better understand their needs and concerns.
5. Foster intergenerational dialogue: Encourage dialogue between older generations of Orthodox Jews and younger generations, as well as between men and women within the community. This can help build bridges and foster a greater understanding of the community's diverse perspectives and experiences.
6. Offer training and education: Provide training and educational opportunities for members of the Orthodox Jewish community to develop their advocacy skills and enhance their knowledge of decision-making processes. This can help them better navigate these systems and ensure their voices are heard.
7. Facilitate access to decision-makers: Make it easier for Orthodox Jewish individuals to access decision-makers, such as government officials, healthcare providers, or community leaders. This can be done by providing introductions, translating documents into Yiddish or Hebrew, or offering cultural sensitivity training for decision-makers
