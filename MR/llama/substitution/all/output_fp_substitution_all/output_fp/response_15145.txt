Addressing the specific needs of non-native or beginner Spanish speakers in education requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Adapt teaching methods: Use practical, interactive, and visual aids to help learners understand complex grammar rules and vocabulary. Provide opportunities for students to practice speaking and listening in small groups or one-on-one situations.
