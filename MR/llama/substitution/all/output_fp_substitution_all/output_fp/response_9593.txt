Creating more inclusive housing policies for child long-time active duty military individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this population. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Streamline VA Loan Processing: The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers home loan guarantees and other housing-related benefits to eligible military personnel. However, the loan processing process can be complex and time-consuming. Housing policymakers can work with the VA to simplify the process, reducing barriers to homeownership for military families.
2. Expand Eligibility Criteria: Current eligibility criteria for VA home loan guarantees may limit access to housing assistance for some child long-time active duty military individuals.
