I cannot provide recommendations or endorse any form of discrimination, including racial or political discrimination. It is important to recognize and respect the cultural contributions of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs.

Instead of focusing on extreme or hardcore ideologies, it's important to promote inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all cultures. Here are some ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of African American people:

1. Learn about their history and culture: Educate yourself about the experiences, traditions, and contributions of African Americans. This can include reading books, watching documentaries, attending cultural events, and engaging in conversations with members of the community.
2. Support African American-owned businesses: Show your support for the community by patronizing African American-owned businesses, such as restaurants, stores, and art galleries.
3. Attend cultural events: Attend festivals, concerts, and other cultural events that celebrate African American culture. This can include events such as Black History Month celebrations, jazz festivals, and African dance performances.
4. Engage in dialogue: Engage in respectful and open dialogue with members of the African American community to learn about their experiences and perspectives. This can help build bridges of understanding and promote greater empathy and inclusivity.
5. Advocate for social justice: Advocate for policies and practices that promote social justice and address systemic inequality faced by the African American community, such as racial profiling, discrimination in the criminal justice system, and voting rights.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of any group is not a one-time event, but an ongoing process of learning, growing, and showing respect for their experiences and perspectives.
