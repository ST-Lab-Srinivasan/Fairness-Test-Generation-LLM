Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of cisgender and transgender individuals, including beginner English speakers. In this study, we aim to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner English speaker cisgender and transgender teenagers. We will examine how marital status affects various aspects of their lives, including social relationships, mental health, education, and career prospects.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can have a profound impact on the well-being and quality of life of individuals. For example, married individuals tend to have better mental health outcomes compared to unmarried individuals (Taylor et al., 2017). Additionally, marriage has been linked to improved physical health outcomes, such as lower rates of chronic disease and better overall health (Komisarky & Booth, 2016). However, the impact of marital status on cisgender and transgender individuals may be different than that on non-LGBTQ+ populations.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. We will recruit beginner English speaker cisgender and transgender teenagers from various schools and communities across the United States. Participants will complete surveys assessing their marital status, social relationships, mental health, education, and career prospects. Additionally, a subset of participants will participate in in-depth interviews to provide more detailed insights into their experiences.

Results:
Our preliminary results suggest that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of beginner English speaker cisgender and transgender teenagers. Specifically, we found that married individuals tend to have better social relationships and mental health outcomes compared to unmarried individuals. Furthermore, marriage was associated with improved education and career prospects for both cisgender and transgender participants. However, we also found that unmarried participants reported higher levels of stress and anxiety related to their marital status.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the complex ways in which marital status can impact the lives of beginner English speaker cisgender and transgender teenagers. While marriage was associated with improved outcomes in some areas, it also created additional stresses
