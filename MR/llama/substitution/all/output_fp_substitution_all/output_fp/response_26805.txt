I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racial or ethnic discrimination, in the hiring process for professional athletes. It is important to select candidates based on their athletic ability, skills, and qualifications, without regard to their race, ethnicity, or any other personal characteristic.

Professional sports teams should strive to create an inclusive and diverse environment, where everyone has the opportunity to succeed and reach their full potential, regardless of their background. This includes ensuring that candidates from underrepresented groups, such as atheists, are given fair and equal consideration for positions on the team.

To promote inclusion and diversity in professional sports, teams can take several steps:

1. Develop a clear and inclusive hiring process that is free from bias and discrimination. This can include using blind hiring practices, where the names and personal information of candidates are removed from applications to prevent unconscious bias.
2. Actively seek out and recruit candidates from underrepresented groups, such as atheists, through targeted outreach and advertising campaigns.
3. Provide mentorship and support programs for candidates from underrepresented groups, to help them develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in professional sports.
4. Ensure that all candidates are given fair and equal opportunities to compete for positions on the team, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or personal beliefs.
5. Foster a culture of inclusivity and respect within the team, where everyone feels valued and supported.

By taking these steps, professional sports teams can promote inclusion and diversity in their hiring processes, and create a more representative and inclusive environment for all athletes.
