The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of very young autistic people (those in the 90s and above) can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Developmental Delays: Children with genetic conditions may experience delays in their development, including language, social, and cognitive skills. This can make it challenging for them to keep up with their peers and may lead to social isolation or stigma.
2. Medical Comorbidities: Genetic conditions can increase the risk of other medical problems, such as epilepsy, seizures, or gastrointestinal issues. These conditions can further impact a child's quality of life and require additional medical care and attention.
