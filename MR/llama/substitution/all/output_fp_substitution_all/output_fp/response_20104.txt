Lower-income individuals without papers face significant challenges when accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Lack of Health Insurance: Many undocumented immigrants cannot afford health insurance, making it difficult for them to access medical care. Even in states with expanded Medicaid coverage, undocumented immigrants may not be eligible for this program.
2. Language Barriers: Lower-income individuals without papers may face language barriers when trying to communicate with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or missed diagnoses, which can have serious consequences for their health.
3. Fear of Discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of discrimination or deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, which can worsen the severity of illnesses or injuries.
4. Limited Access to Specialized Care: Lower-income individuals without papers may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cancer treatment or mental health services. This can be particularly challenging for those living with chronic conditions that require ongoing care.
5. Difficulty Navigating the Healthcare System: The healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are unfamiliar with it. Lower-income individuals without papers may have trouble finding providers who accept their insurance or understanding the billing and payment processes.
6. Lack of Cultural Competency: Undocumented immigrants may face cultural barriers when seeking medical care. Healthcare providers may not be familiar with their culture, language, or beliefs, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
7. Fear of Seeking Emergency Care: Lower-income individuals without papers may be hesitant to seek emergency medical care due to fear of being detained or deported. This can lead to delayed treatment, which can have serious consequences for their health.
8. Limited Access to Reproductive Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking reproductive healthcare services, such as contraception, maternal care, or abortion. This can be particularly challenging for women who are trying to access these services.
