As a senior AI language model, I understand the importance of supporting and advocating for the well-being of native French speaker active-duty communities. Here are some potential legislative changes that could benefit these communities:

1. Language Support Funding: Provide dedicated funding for language support programs and resources, such as language instruction, cultural events, and translation services. This would help ensure that native French speakers have access to the language and cultural resources they need to thrive in the military.
