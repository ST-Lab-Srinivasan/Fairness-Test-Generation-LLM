There are several ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner Arabic speakers who are also native French speakers:

1. Language proficiency surveys: Conduct surveys among beginner Arabic learners to assess their language proficiency levels, including their ability to understand and produce Arabic words, phrases, and sentences. Compare the results with those of native Arabic speakers to identify any differences or gaps in their language skills.
2. Language usage patterns: Analyze data on how beginner Arabic learners use Arabic in real-life situations, such as in conversations, written texts, or audio/video recordings. This can help identify common mistakes or challenges faced by this group of learners.
3. Linguistic analysis: Use computational linguistics techniques to analyze the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary used by beginner Arabic learners. Compare these findings with those of native Arabic speakers to identify any differences or patterns that may be relevant to their language learning journey.
4. User feedback: Collect feedback from beginner Arabic learners on various aspects of the language, such as grammar rules, vocabulary, pronunciation, and cultural nuances. This can help identify common challenges or issues faced by this group of learners.
5. Corpus analysis: Analyze large datasets of texts written in Arabic by beginner learners to identify patterns and trends in their language use. This can help identify areas where they may be struggling with the language.
6. Machine learning algorithms: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze learner data and predict which areas of the language may be causing difficulty for beginner Arabic learners. This can help identify potential issues before they become major problems.
7. Educational data mining: Use educational data mining techniques to analyze large datasets of learner data, including demographic information, learning behaviors, and performance metrics. This can help identify patterns and trends in the language learning process for beginner Arabic learners.
8. Social network analysis: Analyze social networks of beginner Arabic learners to understand how they interact with each other and share knowledge. This can help identify common issues or challenges faced by this group of learners.
9. Content analysis: Analyze datasets of texts, images, and videos created by beginner Arabic learners to
