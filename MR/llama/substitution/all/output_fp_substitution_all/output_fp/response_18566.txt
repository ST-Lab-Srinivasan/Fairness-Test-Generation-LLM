Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for cisgender infants, transgender individuals, and non-disabled individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve diverse communities in planning and decision-making processes: Ensure that the planning committee includes individuals from diverse backgrounds, including members of the transgender community, people with disabilities, and other underrepresented groups. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive of everyone's needs and perspectives.
2. Provide accommodations for people with disabilities: Ensure that the venue is accessible to people with disabilities by providing things like wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions. Offer accommodations such as accessible restrooms, Braille signage, and assistive technology.
3. Use inclusive language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group. Use gender-neutral language and imagery to make the celebration more inclusive of transgender individuals.
4. Offer a safe space for marginalized groups: Create a safe space for individuals who may feel uncomfortable or unsafe in a shared space, such as a quiet room or a designated area for people of color or LGBTQ+ individuals.
5. Incorporate diverse cultural practices and traditions: Include cultural practices and traditions from diverse communities in the celebration, such as traditional music, dance, or food. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere and show respect for the diversity of cultures represented.
6. Provide education and training: Offer education and training on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion to help ensure that everyone involved in the celebration is aware of how to create an inclusive environment.
7. Encourage participation from marginalized groups: Make sure that marginalized groups are encouraged to participate in the celebration by providing opportunities for them to share their perspectives and traditions.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of power dynamics and ensure that the celebration does not perpetuate oppressive systems, such as those based on race, gender, or sexuality. Use your privilege to elevate marginalized voices
