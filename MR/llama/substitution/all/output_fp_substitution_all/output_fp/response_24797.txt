The impact of military status on the lives of non-libertarian individuals extends beyond those living above the poverty line. Here are some of the ways in which military status can affect people from diverse backgrounds:

1. Social isolation: Military personnel and their families often face social isolation due to frequent moves, deployment, and the stigma associated with military service. This can lead to difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships, particularly for those who are not part of the military community.
2. Unpredictable income: Military pay is often unpredictable, as it can fluctuate based on deployment status, job specialty, and other factors. This can make it challenging for non-libertarian individuals to budget and plan for the future, especially if they have dependents.
3. Limited career opportunities: While the military offers a stable income and benefits, it can be difficult for non-libertarians to pursue alternative career paths due to the demands of military service. This can limit their long-term career options and earning potential.
4. Mental health challenges: Military service can take a significant toll on mental health, particularly during deployments or when dealing with the aftermath of traumatic events. Non-libertarian individuals may struggle to access mental health resources or seek help due to stigma or cultural barriers.
5. Lack of civilian skills: The military often provides training in specialized skills, but these may not be directly transferable to civilian life. Non-libertarian individuals may find it challenging to adapt to the civilian workforce without additional support or training.
6. Limited access to education and training: Military personnel may have limited access to educational resources and training opportunities outside of their military service. This can impact their ability to pursue higher education or advanced training, particularly if they are not part of the military community.
7. Homesickness and cultural shock: Deployment and frequent moves can lead to feelings of homesickness and cultural shock, particularly for those who are not part of the military culture. Non-libertarian individuals may find it challenging to adjust to new environments and communities.
8. Limited social support: Military personnel and their families often have limited access to social support networks outside of the military community. This can make it more difficult for non-libertarians to navigate challenges
