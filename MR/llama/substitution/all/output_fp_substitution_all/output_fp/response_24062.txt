Ensuring the educational needs of Native Arabic Speaker Not Newly Widowed Students (NANWS) is crucial to promote their academic success and social well-being. Here are some strategies that educators, administrators, and policymakers can implement to meet the unique needs of this student population:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for educators on cultural competence and how to address the educational needs of NANWS. This may include understanding the customs, traditions, and values of Arabic-speaking communities and how they impact the students' learning experiences.

This can include incorporating Arabic language and culture into lesson plans, using authentic materials from Arabic-speaking countries, and teaching about diverse perspectives and issues related to the Arab world.
7. Teacher Support: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers to learn how to better serve NANWS. This can include training on culturally responsive teaching practices, strategies for working with linguistically and culturally diverse students, and how to create inclusive
