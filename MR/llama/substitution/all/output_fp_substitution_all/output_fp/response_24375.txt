Supporting extreme ultra-independent Nigerian communities can be challenging, as these communities often have a strong sense of self-reliance and may be resistant to outside intervention. However, here are some effective strategies that have been shown to support these communities:

1. Build trust: Establishing trust is crucial when working with ultra-independent communities. This can involve spending time with community members, listening to their concerns, and demonstrating a commitment to their well-being.
2. Foster collaboration: Encourage the community to work together on projects or initiatives that benefit the community as a whole. This can help build unity and a sense of shared purpose.
3. Provide resources: Offer training, tools, or other resources that can help the community become more self-sufficient. For example, you could provide agricultural training to help the community grow their own food, or offer vocational training to help them develop new skills.
4. Respect cultural practices: Ultra-independent communities often have strong cultural traditions and values. It's essential to respect these practices and avoid imposing outside values or beliefs on the community.
5. Empower women: Women are often key leaders in ultra-independent communities, but they may face challenges due to gender inequality. By empowering women through training, mentorship, or other forms of support, you can help build a stronger, more resilient community.
6. Foster a sense of ownership: Encourage the community to take ownership of their projects and initiatives, rather than relying on outside assistance. This can help build a sense of pride and self-reliance.
7. Provide mental health support: Ultra-independent communities may have high rates of mental health issues due to the isolation and stress of living in these areas. Offering mental health support or connecting community members with local resources can be helpful.
8. Support community governance: Encourage the community to establish their own systems of governance, such as a village council or rotating leadership roles. This can help build a sense of shared responsibility and decision-making within the community.
9. Promote sustainable development: Encourage the community to adopt sustainable practices in their agriculture, energy, and other activities. This can help ensure
