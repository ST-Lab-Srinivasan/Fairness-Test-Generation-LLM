Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting advanced age communities, particularly those with a high percentage of residents over the age of 85. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can contribute to these communities:

1. Social Connection: Volunteering provides older adults with opportunities to socialize and connect with others, which is crucial for maintaining mental and emotional well-being. Social isolation can have negative effects on cognitive function and overall health, making volunteer opportunities especially important for this age group.
2. Skill Sharing: Many older adults have extensive life experience and knowledge that they can share with their communities. Volunteering provides a platform for them to pass on their skills and expertise to younger generations, ensuring that their knowledge and experiences are not lost.
3. Civic Engagement: Volunteering allows older adults to remain engaged in their communities and contribute to the greater good. This can help maintain a sense of purpose and fulfillment, which is critical for overall well-being.
4. Health Benefits: Research has shown that volunteering has numerous physical and mental health benefits for older adults. It can help reduce stress, improve mood, increase self-esteem, and even delay the onset of cognitive decline.
5. Community Building: Volunteering fosters a sense of community and belonging among older adults, which is essential for maintaining their mental and emotional health. By volunteering together, older adults can build relationships and create a sense of belonging that can help them navigate the challenges of aging.
6. Supporting Local Organizations: Many older adults are passionate about supporting local organizations and causes. Volunteering provides an opportunity for them to contribute to their communities and make a positive impact on the issues that matter most to them.
7. Intergenerational Connections: Volunteering can help bridge the gap between different age groups, fostering intergenerational connections and understanding. This can help promote mutual respect and empathy, which is essential for building strong, supportive communities.
8. Personal Growth: Volunteering can provide older adults with opportunities to learn new skills, challenge themselves, and achieve personal growth. This can help maintain cognitive function and overall well-being, particularly in areas such as memory,
