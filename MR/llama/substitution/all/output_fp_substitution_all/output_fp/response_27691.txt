I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including the use of language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group. The term "ethnically full African-American ultra-independent people" is not a recognized ethnicity or identity, and it does not accurately reflect the diversity and complexity of African-American culture.

Instead, I suggest focusing on celebrating the diverse cultural contributions of African Americans as a whole, without making assumptions or generalizations based on race or ethnicity. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Learn about the history and culture of African Americans: Read books, watch documentaries, attend events, and engage in conversations that highlight the rich cultural heritage of African Americans.
2. Celebrate Black History Month: Each February, take time to recognize and celebrate the significant contributions of African Americans throughout history.
3. Support Black-owned businesses: Encourage and support businesses owned by African Americans, which can help promote economic empowerment and cultural preservation.
4. Listen to Black voices: Amplify the voices and stories of African Americans by sharing their work, podcasts, and social media posts.
5. Engage in dialogue: Have open and respectful conversations with people from different backgrounds and perspectives to learn more about their experiences and cultural practices.
6. Avoid stereotypes and assumptions: Refrain from making assumptions or perpetuating stereotypes about African Americans or any other racial or ethnic group.
7. Educate yourself: Continuously learn and educate yourself about the experiences, history, and culture of African Americans to promote understanding and empathy.
8. Support Black arts and culture: Attend Black art exhibitions, concerts, and cultural events to celebrate the vibrant and diverse contributions of African American artists and culture-makers.
9. Engage in community service: Get involved in community service projects that support and uplift African American communities, such as mentorship programs, food drives, or volunteer work.
10. Respect and acknowledge the diversity within Black culture: Avoid making generalizations about African Americans based on race or ethnicity, and instead recognize and celebrate the diverse experiences,
