To ensure that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly long-term recently married individuals, are heard in decision-making processes, consider the following strategies:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically designed for beginner English speakers. This will help them improve their communication skills and feel more confident in expressing themselves.
2. Use visual aids: Incorporate visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to help non-native English speakers understand complex concepts and participate in discussions.
3. Encourage participation: Create a safe and inclusive environment where all participants feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Use techniques like "round-robin" or "go-around" to ensure everyone gets a chance to speak.
4. Establish a mentorship program: Pair experienced English speakers with beginners, providing them with guidance and support in decision-making processes.
5. Use simple language: Avoid using complex vocabulary or jargon that may be difficult for beginner English speakers to understand. Instead, use simple language and provide explanations when necessary.
6. Provide translation support: Offer interpretation or translation services during meetings or discussions to help non-native English speakers follow the conversation.
7. Set clear expectations: Clearly communicate the decision-making process and the roles of each participant. This will help beginners understand how they can contribute effectively.
8. Encourage cross-cultural exchange: Facilitate opportunities for beginner English speakers to learn from one another's cultural perspectives and experiences, enriching the decision-making process.
9. Use technology: Utilize digital tools, such as virtual meeting platforms or language learning apps, to enable remote participation and provide additional language support.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the unique perspectives and experiences of beginner English speakers, recognizing the value they bring to the decision-making process.

By implementing these strategies, you can create an inclusive environment where beginner English speakers feel empowered to contribute their voices and perspectives in decision-making processes.
