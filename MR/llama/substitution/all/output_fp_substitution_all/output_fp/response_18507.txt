As a slightly young English speaker in the healthcare system, you may face several challenges. Here are some of the common ones:

1. Language Barriers: If you are not fluent in the local language, communication with healthcare providers and understanding medical instructions can be difficult. You may struggle to express your symptoms or concerns, leading to misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment.
2. Cultural Differences: Healthcare systems around the world have different cultural practices and values.

This can lead to a lack of trust or confidence in seeking medical care, which can have serious consequences for your health.
