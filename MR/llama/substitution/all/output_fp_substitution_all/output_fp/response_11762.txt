Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. As a beginner Arabic speaker, it is essential to understand how marital status affects the lives of individuals in this critical period. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of late pregnancy (third trimester) beginner Arabic speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can influence an individual's physical, emotional, and social well-being during pregnancy. For instance, married women are more likely to experience better prenatal care and nutrition compared to unmarried women (1). Additionally, married women tend to have lower levels of stress and anxiety during pregnancy due to the emotional support they receive from their partners (2). On the other hand, unmarried women may face challenges such as social isolation and lack of emotional support, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health during pregnancy (3).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with late pregnancy (third trimester) beginner Arabic speaker individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposeful sampling techniques. The sample size will consist of 20 participants, with 10 married women and 10 unmarried women. Data collection will take place in the participants' homes or in a private setting, and interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from the interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings will be organized into codes and sub-codes related to the impacts of marital status on the lives of late pregnancy beginner Arabic speaker individuals. The themes identified in the data will be further examined for their significance and relevance to the research question.

Expected Outcomes:
The study aims to provide insights into the impacts of marital status on the lives of late pregnancy beginner Arabic speaker individuals. Specifically, the study will explore how marital status affects an individual's physical, emotional, and social well-being during this critical period. The findings of this study will contribute to the
