The challenges faced by non-independent ethnically full Asian people in the healthcare system can vary depending on individual experiences and cultural background. However, some common challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many Asian immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can create difficulties in communicating with healthcare providers, understanding medical instructions, and navigating the healthcare system.
2. Cultural differences: Different ethnic groups within the Asian population may have distinct cultural beliefs and practices that can impact their healthcare experiences. For example, some may prefer traditional Chinese medicine or other alternative therapies over Western medicine.
3. Access to care: Limited English proficiency or lack of knowledge about the healthcare system can make it harder for non-independent Asian people to access timely and appropriate medical care.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin still exists in many parts of the world, including the healthcare system. Non-independent Asian people may face discrimination when seeking medical care, which can lead to delays or poor treatment.
5. Stigma and shame: In some cultures, there may be a stigma attached to seeking mental health services or disclosing mental health issues. This can make it harder for non-independent Asian people to seek help when they need it.
6. Lack of representation: Non-independent Asian people may feel that their cultural background and experiences are not represented in the healthcare system, leading to a lack of understanding and empathy from providers.
7. Limited education: Some non-independent Asian people may have limited access to healthcare education, which can make it harder for them to navigate the healthcare system or understand their medical conditions.
8. Caregiving responsibilities: Non-independent Asian people may be responsible for caring for elderly or disabled family members, which can limit their ability to access healthcare services.
9. Financial barriers: Many non-independent Asian people may face financial barriers when accessing healthcare services, such as lack of insurance coverage or limited financial resources.
10. Lack of trust: Non-independent Asian people may have difficulty trusting the healthcare system due to historical or personal experiences of discrimination or poor treatment.
