There are several challenges faced by Nigerian individuals who are above the poverty line but still face legal issues. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited access to legal services: While some individuals may have a higher income, they may not have access to quality legal services due to a lack of resources or infrastructure in their area.
2. Discrimination: Discrimination based on social class, race, or gender can still occur in the legal system, making it difficult for individuals from these groups to access justice.
3. Corruption: Corruption and bribery can be prevalent in the legal system, making it difficult for individuals to navigate the legal process without paying bribes or using illegal means to achieve their goals.
4. Complexity of laws: The Nigerian legal system is complex, with many laws and regulations that can be difficult to understand and navigate, even for those who have a good understanding of the law.
5. Lack of transparency: There may be a lack of transparency in the legal system, making it difficult for individuals to know their rights and how to access justice.
6. Limited access to information: Some individuals may not have access to information about their legal rights and options, making it difficult for them to make informed decisions about their legal issues.
7. Language barriers: In a country with over 250 languages spoken, language barriers can create difficulties for individuals who do not speak the dominant language of the region they are in.
8. Cultural barriers: Cultural differences and norms can also create barriers for individuals from different cultures, making it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
9. Gender bias: Women may face gender bias in the legal system, which can limit their access to justice.
10. Limited resources: Even those who are above the poverty line may not have the financial resources to access quality legal services or to pursue legal action.

Overall, while there are some improvements in the Nigerian legal system, there are still significant challenges that individuals face when trying to access justice, regardless of their income level.
