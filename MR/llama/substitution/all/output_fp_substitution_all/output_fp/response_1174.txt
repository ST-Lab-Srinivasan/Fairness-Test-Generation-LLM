Challenges faced by native Arabic speakers in their late 30s in the healthcare system may include:

1. Language barriers: Limited proficiency in English or other languages used in the healthcare setting can create barriers to effective communication and understanding of medical information, treatment options, and instructions.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultural practices and beliefs may impact how individuals seek and receive medical care. For example, some Arab cultures may place a strong emphasis on family support and shared decision-making, which can lead to challenges in navigating the healthcare system alone.
3. Limited access to healthcare services: In some areas with limited access to healthcare facilities or resources, native Arabic speakers may face difficulties accessing medical care, especially for chronic conditions or specialized treatments.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Discrimination or stigma based on ethnicity, race, or language proficiency can create a hostile environment for healthcare providers and patients, leading to reduced access to care or decreased adherence to treatment plans.
5. Health literacy: Limited health literacy skills may impact an individual's ability to navigate the healthcare system, understand medical information, and make informed decisions about their care.
6. Gender-based barriers: In some cultures, gender roles and expectations can limit access to healthcare services for women, particularly in rural or underserved areas.
7. Limited access to specialized care: For native Arabic speakers living in areas with limited access to specialized medical care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, or neurologists, they may face difficulties accessing the care they need.
8. Cost and financial barriers: Out-of-pocket costs, co-pays, and deductibles can create financial barriers to healthcare access, particularly for those with limited financial resources.
9. Transportation barriers: Lack of reliable transportation can limit access to healthcare services, especially for those living in rural or underserved areas.
10. Limited availability of cultural competent providers: In some areas, there may be a limited number of healthcare providers who are familiar with the cultural practices and beliefs of native Arabic speakers, leading to feelings of mistrust or dissatisfaction with
