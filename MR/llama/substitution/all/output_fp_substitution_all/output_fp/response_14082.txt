Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for documented non-liberal individuals requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand and acknowledge the diverse experiences of non-liberal individuals: It's essential to recognize that each person has their unique cultural background, beliefs, and practices. Take the time to learn about the specific traditions and customs of the individuals you want to include in your celebrations.
2. Be mindful of power dynamics: Non-liberal individuals may face discrimination or marginalization in society. Be aware of these dynamics and work to create a space where everyone feels valued and respected.
3. Involve non-liberal individuals in the planning process: Invite them to participate in the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that their perspectives and needs are taken into account.
4. Be flexible and adaptable: Be willing to adjust your plans if necessary to accommodate the needs of non-liberal individuals. For example, if someone has a dietary restriction, be prepared to provide alternative food options.
5. Provide accessibility and accommodations: Ensure that your celebrations are accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities or mobility issues. Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or wheelchair-accessible venues.
6. Avoid cultural appropriation: Be mindful of the cultural traditions and practices of non-liberal individuals, and avoid adopting them without proper understanding or permission. Instead, seek to learn from and respect their cultural heritage.
7. Foster inclusive language and communication: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and identities. Avoid using language that may be offensive or alienating to non-liberal individuals.
8. Address power imbalances: Be aware of any power imbalances that may exist within the group, and work to address them. For example, if there is a disproportionate amount of representation from one cultural group, make an effort to include perspectives from other groups.
9. Encourage cross-cultural exchange: Create opportunities for non-liberal individuals to share their traditions and practices with others
