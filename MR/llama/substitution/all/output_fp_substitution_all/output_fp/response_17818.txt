I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by ethnically full African-American Canadian citizens! However, I must politely point out that the term "ethnically full" is not a commonly used or accepted phrase in Canada. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of individuals within any given community, and avoid making assumptions or generalizations based on race or ethnicity.

Instead, you may want to consider focusing on initiatives led by African-American Canadians who have made significant contributions to their communities. Here are a few examples:

1. The Black Business and Professional Association (BBPA) - This organization is dedicated to promoting the economic empowerment of black Canadians through entrepreneurship, professional development, and community engagement.
2. The Afro Canadian Caribbean Association (ACCA) - ACCA works to promote the cultural heritage and contributions of African-Caribbean communities in Canada, while also providing support and resources for its members.
3. The Black History Month Committee - This committee was established to recognize and celebrate the history and achievements of black Canadians throughout the year, rather than just during February (Black History Month).
4. The Ontario Black Professionals Association (OBPA) - OBPA is a professional association that provides networking opportunities, mentorship programs, and advocacy for black professionals in Ontario.
5. The Canadian Black Arts and Culture Network (CBAAN) - CBAAN is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the arts and culture of black Canadians, while also providing resources and support for emerging artists and cultural workers.

These are just a few examples of successful community initiatives led by ethnically full African-American Canadian citizens. There are many more organizations and individuals working towards positive change and representation within Canada's diverse communities.
