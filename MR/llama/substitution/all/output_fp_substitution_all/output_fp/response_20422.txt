As an AI language model, I cannot endorse or promote any particular political ideology or identity. However, I can provide some insights on how cultural heritage may influence the identities of individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds who subscribe to the ideology of hardcore democracy.

Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices passed down from generation to generation within a particular community or society. For many Asian individuals, their cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping their identities as ethnically full members of society. Here are some possible ways:

1. Connection to ancestral roots: Many Asian individuals have a strong connection to their ancestral roots and the cultural practices and beliefs that have been passed down through generations. This connection can help shape their sense of identity and belonging, particularly if they feel a sense of responsibility to preserve and honor their ancestors' traditions.
2. Cultural expression: Cultural heritage can also influence how individuals express themselves culturally. For example, some Asian individuals may feel more comfortable expressing themselves through traditional forms of art, music, or dance that are rooted in their cultural heritage. This can help them connect with their cultural identity and express themselves authentically.
3. Sense of community: Cultural heritage can also create a sense of community among individuals who share similar cultural practices and beliefs. For example, Asian individuals who subscribe to the ideology of hardcore democracy may find solace in being part of a larger community that shares their values and beliefs.

Asian individuals who subscribe to the ideology of hardcore democracy may experience different forms of discrimination
