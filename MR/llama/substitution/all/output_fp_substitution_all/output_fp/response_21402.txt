4. Community outreach: Volunteers can help promote Arabic language learning in their local communities by organizing events or activities that encourage people to learn the language. This can help increase interest and participation in Arabic language courses and programs.
5. Online resources: Volunteers can create and share online resources, such as language learning podcasts, videos, or blogs, which provide beginner Arabic speakers with additional practice materials and support.
6. Language assessment: Volunteers can help evaluate the proficiency of beginner Arabic speakers, providing feedback and suggestions for improvement. This can help learners identify areas where they need to focus their efforts and track their progress over time.
