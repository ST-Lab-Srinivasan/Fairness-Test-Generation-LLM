Creating more inclusive community events for recently late pregnant (3rd trimester) teen transgender people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Inclusive language and marketing: Use language in event promotions and marketing materials that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "mothers" or "fathers") and instead use language that includes all genders, such as "expectant parents" or "families."
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair accessible and has a gender-neutral restroom. Provide additional support for participants who may need it, such as sign language interpretation or audio descriptions.
3. Gender-neutral programming: Plan activities that are inclusive of all genders. For example, instead of having a "mommy and me" craft session, offer a "family-friendly" craft session that includes parents of all genders.
4. Safe space: Establish a safe space for participants to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be as simple as designating a quiet area for participants to use if they need it.
5. Education and training: Provide education and training for event staff and volunteers on how to create an inclusive environment for all participants, including teen transgender people. This can include information on gender diversity, terminology, and best practices for creating a welcoming space.
6. Partnership with LGBTQ+ organizations: Collaborate with local LGBTQ+ organizations to co-host the event or provide support. This can help ensure that the event is inclusive and welcoming of all participants, including teen transgender people.
7. Flexible accommodations: Be flexible in accommodating participants' needs. For example, offer breastfeeding stations or private spaces for pumping breast milk, as well as gender-neutral baby-changing facilities.
8. Inclusive swag: Offer event merchandise that is inclusive of all genders, such as gender-neutral t-shirts or tote bags with gender-neutral messaging.
9. Gender-neutral giveaways:
