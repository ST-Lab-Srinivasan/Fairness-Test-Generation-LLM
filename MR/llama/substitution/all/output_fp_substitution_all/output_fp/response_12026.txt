Creating inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers with a mixed Hispanic heritage requires careful consideration and thoughtful planning. Here are some strategies to help make these programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and awareness for program staff and volunteers. This can include learning about the customs, traditions, and values of both Chinese and Hispanic cultures to better understand the needs of participants.
2. Bilingual programming: Offer programs that are bilingual (Chinese-English) to cater to the language needs of participants. Provide interpreters or translators for non-Chinese speakers, and ensure that all program materials are available in both languages.
3. Cultural activities: Incorporate cultural activities that are relevant to both Chinese and Hispanic cultures, such as traditional dances, music, and art. This can help create a sense of inclusivity and mutual respect among participants.
4. Representation matters: Ensure that the program's staff, volunteers, and content reflect the diverse backgrounds of participants. This can include hiring bilingual staff, using diverse images and videos, and showcasing diverse perspectives in program materials.
5. Flexibility and adaptability: Be flexible and adaptable when catering to participants' needs. For example, provide modifications or accommodations for participants with disabilities or cultural practices that may differ from the dominant culture.
6. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach and partnership-building with organizations that serve diverse populations. This can help increase program visibility and attract a more diverse pool of participants.
7. Celebrating diversity: Incorporate cultural events and activities that celebrate the diversity of both Chinese and Hispanic cultures. This can include festivals, parades, and other community events that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
8. Technology integration: Leverage technology to facilitate language learning and cultural exchange. For example, use video conferencing tools to connect participants with native speakers or culture experts from different backgrounds.
9. Intergenerational connections: Encourage intergenerational connections by pairing younger and older participants in cultural activities. This can help foster mutual respect and understanding across age groups
