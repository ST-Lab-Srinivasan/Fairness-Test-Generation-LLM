1. Age-friendly design: Ensure that the housing policies prioritize age-friendly design elements, such as wider hallways, easier navigation, and accessible amenities like elevators, ramps, and bathroom fixtures.
2. Inclusive zoning regulations: Develop zoning regulations that promote mixed-age housing developments, allowing older adults to live in diverse communities with people of different ages and abilities.
3. Affordable housing options: Provide affordable housing options for over 90-year-old active-duty individuals, such as age-restricted buildings or neighborhoods with lower property values.
4. Home modification programs: Offer home modification programs to help older adults adapt their living spaces to meet their changing needs, such as installing grab bars, non-slip flooring, and walk-in showers.
5. Transportation alternatives: Provide alternative transportation options, such as senior transportation services or mobility aids like walkers, canes, and wheelchairs, to ensure that older adults can access essential services and activities.
6. Social connections: Encourage social connections among older adults through community events, volunteer opportunities, and intergenerational programs that bring together people of different ages and backgrounds.
7. Access to healthcare: Ensure that older adults have access to quality healthcare services, including preventive care, chronic disease management, and mental health support, which can help them maintain their independence and well-being.
8. Education and training: Offer education and training programs that help older adults develop new skills and adapt to the changing needs of aging, such as technology training or cognitive training programs.
9. Supportive services: Provide supportive services like home healthcare, personal care, and companionship services to help older adults maintain their independence and quality of life.
10. Policy advocacy: Advocate for policies that support the needs of over 90-year-old active-duty individuals, such as age-based discrimination protections, affordable housing subsidies,
