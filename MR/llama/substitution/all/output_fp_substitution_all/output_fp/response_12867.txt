Ensuring that the educational needs of active duty military mixed Hispanic heritage students are met requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that schools and educators can consider:

1. Understand the unique challenges faced by military-connected students: Military-connected students often face unique challenges such as frequent moves, deployments, and separations from family members. These challenges can impact their academic performance and social-emotional well-being. Educators should be aware of these challenges and provide support to help students navigate them.
2. Provide flexible learning options: Military-connected students may have varying schedules due to their parents' deployments or military obligations. Schools can offer flexible learning options such as online courses, accelerated learning programs, or flexible scheduling to help these students stay on track with their academic progress.

Educators can promote inclusivity and cultural competency by incorporating diverse perspectives, using teaching strategies that reflect the students' backgrounds, and providing opportunities for student reflection and expression.

5. Address the needs of non-traditional students: Military-connected students may not fit into traditional academic expectations, such as attending school during regular hours or following a structured curriculum. Educators should be flexible and accommodating of these unique circumstances to ensure that all students have access to quality education.

Schools can involve parents in the educational process through regular communication, parent-teacher conferences, and opportunities for involvement in decision-making processes.
