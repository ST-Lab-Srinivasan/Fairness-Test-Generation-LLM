Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native Chinese speakers who are ethnically full Asian people. Here are some ways:

1. Identity formation: Cultural heritage serves as an important factor in shaping the identity of native Chinese speakers, particularly those from non-Han Chinese ethnic groups. Their cultural practices, traditions, and beliefs help them define their sense of self and belonging within their respective communities.
2. Sense of community: Cultural heritage provides a shared framework for communication, understanding, and mutual support among native Chinese speakers from different ethnic backgrounds. It helps foster a sense of belonging and connection to their cultural origins, which can be especially important in a country where the Han Chinese majority may dominate other cultures.
3. Preservation of cultural practices: Cultural heritage serves as a link to the past and a means of preserving traditional practices and beliefs. For example, many ethnic minority groups in China have managed to maintain their unique customs, such as the Yi people's New Year celebrations or the Bai people's dragon dances, despite the influence of modernization and urbanization.
4. Resistance against assimilation: Cultural heritage can serve as a means of resistance against assimilation into the dominant Han Chinese culture. By preserving their unique cultural practices and traditions, ethnic minority groups in China can maintain their distinct identities and avoid being lost in the larger cultural landscape.
5. Intergenerational transmission: Cultural heritage is often transmitted from one generation to the next, allowing native Chinese speakers to maintain a connection to their cultural roots. This intergenerational transmission helps preserve cultural practices and traditions, ensuring that they continue to play a role in the lives of native Chinese speakers.
6. Personal identity: Cultural heritage can also play a significant role in the personal identity of native Chinese speakers. It provides a sense of individuality and self-expression, allowing them to explore their cultural background and express themselves through their unique customs and traditions.
7. Community cohesion: Cultural heritage can help foster community cohesion among native Chinese speakers from different ethnic groups. By sharing cultural practices and traditions, they can build bridges across their communities and create a sense of unity and cooperation.
8. Economic development:
