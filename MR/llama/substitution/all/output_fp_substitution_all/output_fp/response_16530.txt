The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of native Chinese speakers who are not conservative. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Pressure: In China, there is a strong social pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations, particularly for women. Non-conservative individuals may face discrimination and marginalization within their communities, which can impact their mental health and overall well-being.
2. Limited Access to Education and Employment: Non-conservative individuals may face barriers when accessing education and employment opportunities due to their non-conformist beliefs and behaviors. This can limit their career advancement and earning potential, leading to financial hardship and insecurity.
3. Lack of Representation and Visibility: Non-conservative individuals may feel marginalized and invisible within their communities, particularly if they are part of a minority group. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from society, which can have negative impacts on mental health and overall well-being.
