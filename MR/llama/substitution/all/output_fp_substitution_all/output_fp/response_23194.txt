As a recent green card holder, an unemployed Native American face several challenges in accessing healthcare in the US. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Lack of access to health insurance: Many unemployed Native Americans lack access to affordable health insurance, which can make it difficult to receive necessary medical care. Without insurance, they may be unable to afford expensive medical procedures or treatments.
2. Limited availability of healthcare providers: In many rural areas where Native Americans live, there may be a shortage of healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about their cultural and linguistic needs. This can make it difficult for them to receive culturally competent care.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages and may not be fluent in English, which can create communication barriers when trying to access healthcare services. Providers who are not familiar with these languages may struggle to communicate effectively with patients.
