Highlighting the issues faced by native French speakers and native English speakers can be done through various means, including:

1. Language Proficiency Tests: Conduct language proficiency tests to measure the language skills of both groups. This will help identify areas where individuals from each group may struggle more than the other. For example, a test could assess vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and comprehension abilities.
2. Surveys and Interviews: Conduct surveys or interviews to gather data on the language use and perception of both groups. This can help identify how individuals from each group experience language barriers or difficulties in their daily lives. For example, you could ask questions about communication challenges, cultural differences, and language-related stress.
3. Corpus Analysis: Analyze large datasets of texts to identify patterns of language use and comprehension difficulties. This can help identify common areas where individuals from each group may struggle more than the other. For example, you could analyze a corpus of written texts to see how often certain words or phrases are used by native French speakers versus native English speakers.

This can help identify if there are any negative perceptions or stereotypes towards native French speakers or native English speakers that could contribute to language barriers. For example, you could ask questions about how comfortable individuals feel speaking in each other's language, or whether they perceive any differences in proficiency levels between the two groups.
