The impact of military status on the lives of non-libertarian, non-upper middle-income individuals can vary significantly. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to education and job opportunities: Non-libertarian, non-upper middle-income individuals may face barriers in accessing quality education and job opportunities due to their military status. This can limit their ability to advance in their careers and increase their earning potential.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Military status can lead to stigma and discrimination, particularly for those who serve in lower-ranking positions or in non-combat roles. Non-libertarian individuals may face discrimination in employment, housing, and social situations due to their military status.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Military personnel may have limited access to healthcare services, particularly if they are not eligible for veterans' benefits. This can result in delayed or inadequate medical care, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
4. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: Military personnel may struggle to adjust to civilian life after serving in the military. They may experience difficulty finding employment, building relationships, and navigating social situations due to the unique culture and expectations of the military.
5. Mental health challenges: Military personnel are at a higher risk of developing mental health challenges, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. These challenges can impact their ability to function in civilian life and may require ongoing support and treatment.

7. Difficulty balancing work and family responsibilities: Military personnel may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities due to long working hours, frequent deployments, and the demands of military service. This can lead to stress and burnout, which can impact their mental health and relationships.
