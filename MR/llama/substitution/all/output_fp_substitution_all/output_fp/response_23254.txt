Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-independent native Chinese speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional design approach that considers their unique needs and experiences. Here are some strategies to achieve this goal:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to individuals with limited mobility or hearing/visual impairments. Provide clear signage, Braille labels, and audio descriptions for visual content. Offer assistive technology devices such as wheelchairs, walkers, and communication aids upon request.
2. Language Support: Offer language support services such as interpreters, translators, or bilingual staff to facilitate communication between non-independent native Chinese speakers and other users. Provide multilingual materials and signs in languages spoken by the local community.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Design the public space with cultural sensitivity in mind. Incorporate elements of Chinese culture, such as traditional artwork or artifacts, to create a welcoming environment for non-independent native Chinese speakers.
4. Technology Integration: Leverage technology to enhance accessibility and inclusivity. For example, install audio induction loops for individuals with hearing impairments or provide virtual reality experiences for those with mobility issues.
5. Inclusive Wayfinding: Develop an inclusive wayfinding system that considers the needs of non-independent native Chinese speakers. Use clear and simple language in signage, provide audio directions, and use visual cues such as color-coded routes or tactile markers for individuals with cognitive or sensory impairments.
6. Community Outreach: Engage with local communities to understand their needs and preferences. Conduct outreach programs to raise awareness about the public space and its inclusive features, and encourage community members to provide feedback and suggestions.
7. Training and Education: Provide training for staff and volunteers on how to interact with non-independent native Chinese speakers in a respectful and inclusive manner. Offer cultural sensitivity workshops and language classes to enhance their ability to communicate with this population.
8. Flexibility and Adaptability: Design the public space to be adaptable to different user needs. For example, provide flexible seating options, adjustable tables, or wheelchair-accessible bathrooms
