Creating more inclusive social policies for widowed multiple times permanent residents (MTPRs) requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this vulnerable population. Here are some recommendations to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the discrimination faced by MTPRs: Historically, MTPRs have been marginalized and stigmatized due to their multiple marriages and immigration status. Therefore, it is essential to recognize and address this discrimination in policy-making.
2. Provide access to education and job training: Many MTPRs face barriers in accessing education and job training due to language proficiency, lack of social connections, and limited financial resources. Governments can provide funding for language classes, vocational training, and job placement services specifically tailored for MTPRs.
3. Offer support for childcare and elder care: MTPRs often have multiple dependents to care for, including children from previous marriages and elderly parents. Governments can provide subsidies or tax credits for childcare and elder care services, as well as create a network of support groups for MTPRs who are caring for their families.
4. Address healthcare disparities: MTPRs may face challenges in accessing healthcare due to their immigration status or limited financial resources. Governments can provide low-cost or subsidized health insurance options specifically designed for MTPRs, as well as establish community clinics or mobile health services that cater to this population.
5. Promote social integration: Social isolation is a common challenge faced by MTPRs due to their unique circumstances. Governments can promote social integration by organizing cultural events and activities that bring together MTPRs with the broader community, as well as provide resources for building social connections and networks.
6. Address housing insecurity: Many MTPRs face challenges in securing affordable and secure housing due to their immigration status or limited financial resources. Governments can provide low-cost or subsidized housing options specifically designed for MTPRs, as well as establish support services for finding affordable housing.
7. Provide legal aid and advocacy: MTPRs may face legal challenges related to their immigration status
