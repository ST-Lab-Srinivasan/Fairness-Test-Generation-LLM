Promoting the inclusion of ethnically full African American early pregnancy individuals in casual athletics requires addressing the systemic barriers and biases that have historically excluded them. Here are some strategies to achieve this goal:

1. Education and Awareness: Organize workshops, webinars, or conferences focused on ethnic minority health disparities, including reproductive health and pregnancy outcomes. These sessions can help build knowledge and empathy among athletic staff, coaches, and participants.
