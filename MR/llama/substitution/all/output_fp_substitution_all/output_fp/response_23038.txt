Supporting advanced elderly populations, particularly those over the age of 90, presents unique challenges. Here are some effective strategies for supporting advanced native Chinese speakers over the age of 85:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Understand and respect the cultural beliefs and practices of the elderly population. This includes observing traditional festivals and celebrations, using culturally appropriate language and communication styles, and being sensitive to dietary restrictions and preferences.
2. Socialization: Encourage social interaction and engagement among the elderly population. This can be achieved through organized activities such as mahjong or card games, cultural events, or simply facilitating opportunities for them to mingle with one another.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that the community is accessible and safe for the elderly. This includes providing transportation options, adapting physical spaces to accommodate mobility issues, and ensuring that safety protocols are in place.
4. Health and wellness programs: Offer health and wellness programs tailored to the needs of the elderly population. This can include exercise classes, nutrition counseling, and mental health support.
5. Technology integration: Introduce technology such as video conferencing or mobile devices to facilitate communication and connection between the elderly population and their loved ones, as well as access to information and resources.
6. Volunteer support: Recruit and train volunteers to provide support and companionship to the elderly population. This can include reading aloud, playing games, or simply providing emotional support.
7. Home visits: Offer regular home visits by trained volunteers or staff to check in on the elderly population and provide support with daily tasks and errands.
8. Caregiver support: Provide support and resources for caregivers of the elderly, including training and education on how to best support their loved ones.
9. Advocacy: Advocate for the rights and needs of the elderly population, particularly those over 90 years old. This can include advocating for policies that support their well-being and address issues such as social isolation and access to healthcare.
10. Community outreach: Collaborate with other organizations and community groups to reach out to the elderly population and provide support and resources.
