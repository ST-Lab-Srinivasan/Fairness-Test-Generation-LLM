The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of over 90-year-old physically disabled people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Reduced mobility and independence: Many genetic conditions that cause physical disabilities can also affect an individual's mobility and independence. For example, muscular dystrophy can lead to muscle weakness and wasting, making it difficult for individuals to walk or perform daily tasks without assistance.
2. Social isolation: Physical disabilities can make it challenging for individuals to participate in social activities and events, leading to social isolation and loneliness. This can further exacerbate feelings of depression and anxiety.
3. Financial burden: Caring for a loved one with a genetic condition can be expensive, particularly if they require ongoing medical care or assistive technology. This can lead to financial strain and stress on the family.
4. Emotional toll: Living with a genetic condition can take an emotional toll on individuals and their families. The uncertainty and unpredictability of the condition can cause anxiety, fear, and stress, while the loss of autonomy and independence can lead to feelings of grief and loss.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to many genetic conditions, leading to discrimination and social exclusion. This can further erode an individual's sense of self-worth and identity.
6. Limited access to healthcare: Individuals with genetic conditions may face challenges in accessing appropriate healthcare due to a lack of specialized services or resources in their area. This can result in delayed diagnosis, inadequate treatment, and poor quality of life.
7. Psychological impact: Living with a genetic condition can also have psychological impacts, such as increased stress levels, anxiety, and depression. This can affect an individual's overall well-being and quality of life.
8. Impact on relationships: Genetic conditions can also have a significant impact on relationships within the family. Caring for a loved one with a genetic condition can be emotionally and physically draining, leading to stress and strain on family relationships.
