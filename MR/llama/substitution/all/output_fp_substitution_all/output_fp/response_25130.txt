Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for Nigerian actively slightly heterosexual individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the Community: Engage with the Nigerian community in your area to understand their preferences and needs. This will help you create a cultural celebration that resonates with them and feels inclusive.
2. Representative of Heterosexuality: Incorporate elements that are representative of heterosexuality, such as same-sex couples, gender-nonconforming individuals, and diverse sexual expressions. This will help create a cultural celebration that is inclusive of all sexual orientations.
3. Education and Awareness: Provide educational resources and awareness campaigns to educate people about the diversity of sexual orientations and genders. This will help break down barriers and promote acceptance and understanding.
4. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for individuals of all sexual orientations and genders to participate in cultural celebrations without fear of discrimination or harassment.
5. Cultural Sensitivity: Be culturally sensitive when creating the cultural celebration, respecting the traditional values and beliefs of Nigerian culture while also being inclusive of diverse sexual orientations and genders.
6. Involve LGBTQ+ Individuals: Involve LGBTQ+ individuals in the planning and execution of the cultural celebration to ensure that it is inclusive and meets their needs.
7. Celebrate Diversity: Embrace diversity and promote a culture of inclusivity during the cultural celebration, encouraging participants to express themselves freely without fear of judgment or discrimination.
8. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow participants to learn about and express their sexual orientation and gender identity in a safe and respectful manner.
9. Community Partnerships: Collaborate with local LGBTQ+ organizations and community groups to promote the cultural celebration and ensure its success.
10. Post-Celebration Follow-Up: After the cultural celebration, follow up with participants to gather feedback and assess the inclusivity of the event. Use this information to improve future celebrations and make them more inclusive for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
