As a beginner Arabic speaker in your late 30s, you may face several challenges when navigating the healthcare system in an Arabic-speaking country. Here are some of the common challenges that you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: The biggest challenge faced by non-native speakers is the language barrier. Limited proficiency in Arabic can make it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers, fill out medical forms, and understand complex medical terminology.
