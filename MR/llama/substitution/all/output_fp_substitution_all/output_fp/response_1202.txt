Ensuring the healthcare needs of active duty military personnel who have recently turned 65 is crucial to maintaining their overall well-being and quality of life. Here are some ways to ensure that these individuals receive the necessary care:

1. Military Health System (MHS): The MHS provides medical care to active duty service members, including those who have recently turned 65. The MHS includes a network of military hospitals and clinics, as well as civilian providers who are part of the TRICARE program. Active duty service members can receive care through the MHS regardless of their age.
2. Veterans Administration (VA) Healthcare: Once they leave the military, veterans can access healthcare services through the VA. The VA provides a range of medical services, including primary care, specialty care, and mental health services. Veterans can schedule appointments at VA facilities or use the VA's telemedicine services.
3. Medicare: All military retirees are eligible for Medicare coverage after they turn 65. Medicare provides hospital insurance, medical insurance, and prescription drug coverage. Retirees can enroll in Medicare Part A (hospital insurance), Medicare Part B (medical insurance), and Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage).
4. Medigap Insurance: Medigap insurance is designed to help cover out-of-pocket expenses not covered by Original Medicare, such as deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments. Many military retirees choose to purchase Medigap insurance to supplement their Medicare coverage.
5. Health Savings Accounts (HSAs): HSAs are tax-exempt savings accounts that can be used to save money for medical expenses. Military retirees who have reached the age of 65 may be eligible for an HSA if they are covered by a high-deductible health plan.
6. Community Clinics: Many communities have clinics that provide low-cost or free healthcare services to uninsured or underinsured individuals, including veterans and their families. Military retirees who cannot afford private insurance or do not qualify for government-provided coverage may find these clinics
