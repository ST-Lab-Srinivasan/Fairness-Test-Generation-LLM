6. Provide education and job training: Offer educational and job training programs to help spouses acquire new skills and knowledge that can help them contribute to the family income and become more financially independent.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage older couples to mentor or connect with younger couples, sharing their wisdom and experience to help build stronger families and communities.
8. Celebrate cultural heritage: Organize events that celebrate Nigerian culture and tradition, such as festivals, concerts, or cultural exhibitions, which can help foster a sense of community and belonging among long-term married couples.
