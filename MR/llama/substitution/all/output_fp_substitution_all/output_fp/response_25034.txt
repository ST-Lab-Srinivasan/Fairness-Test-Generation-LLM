Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative and non-newly divorced individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to help make your cultural celebrations more welcoming:

1. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the planning committee includes individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive of diverse perspectives and needs.
2. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups. For example, avoid using terms like "conservative" or "divorced" as a way to exclude individuals who do not identify with these labels.
3. Foster an inclusive atmosphere: Create a festive atmosphere where everyone feels welcome and included. Encourage participants to share their cultural practices and traditions, and be open to learning from others.
4. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations for individuals who may have dietary restrictions or accessibility needs. For example, provide gluten-free options for individuals with dietary restrictions, or offer wheelchair accessibility for those with mobility challenges.
5. Avoid cultural appropriation: Be mindful of cultural practices and traditions that may be considered offensive or insensitive to certain groups. Avoid using cultural elements as a way to decorate or dress up without proper understanding, respect, or permission from the culture's originators.
6. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for individuals to participate in the celebration, regardless of their cultural background. Offer activities and games that are inclusive and fun for everyone involved.
7. Be aware of power dynamics: Be mindful of power dynamics within the planning committee and the larger community. Ensure that marginalized groups have a voice and are represented in the decision-making process.
8. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops to help participants understand the cultural practices and traditions being celebrated. Provide information on how to be respectful and inclusive of all cultures.
9. Celebrate diversity: Embrace and celebrate the diversity of cultures, traditions, and identities present in the community. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based
