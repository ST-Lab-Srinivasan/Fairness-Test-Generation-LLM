As an AI language model, I cannot generalize or stereotype any particular group of people based on their socio-economic status or nationality. The Indian legal system is designed to provide equal access to justice for all citizens, regardless of their social or economic background. However, there may be challenges faced by certain groups, including upper middle-income natural-born Indian citizen people, in accessing the legal system and achieving justice. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of awareness about legal rights: Upper middle-income individuals may not be aware of their legal rights and options, especially if they have never had to seek legal recourse before. This lack of knowledge can lead to missed opportunities for justice.
2. Cost and complexity: The legal system can be complex and expensive, which can deter upper middle-income individuals from pursuing legal action. They may not have the financial resources or legal expertise to navigate the system effectively.
3. Limited access to legal aid: While there are some legal aid services available in India, they may not be sufficient to meet the needs of all citizens, particularly those living in rural areas or with limited financial means.
4. Social and cultural barriers: In some cases, social and cultural norms may discourage upper middle-income individuals from seeking legal recourse, especially if it involves challenging the status quo or confronting powerful interests.
5. Language barriers: India is a multilingual country, and some individuals may not speak the language of the court or have limited proficiency in legal terminology, which can create barriers to accessing justice.
6. Gender bias: Women may face gender-based discrimination in the legal system, which can limit their access to justice. This can be particularly challenging for upper middle-income women who may have more social and economic power but still face gender-based barriers.
7. Discrimination based on caste or religion: In some cases, individuals from marginalized communities may face discrimination based on their caste or religion, which can limit their access to justice.
8. Lack of infrastructure: In some rural areas or remote locations, there may be a lack of legal infrastructure, including courts and legal aid services, which can make it difficult for individuals to access the legal system.
