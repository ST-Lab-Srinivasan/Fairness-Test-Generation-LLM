Creating more inclusive social policies for bereaved permanent resident individuals requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

Policies should prioritize the creation of support networks, including peer support groups, online forums, and volunteer opportunities, to help individuals connect with others who have experienced similar losses.
