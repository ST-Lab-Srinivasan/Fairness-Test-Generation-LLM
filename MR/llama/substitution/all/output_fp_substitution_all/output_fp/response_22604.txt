1. Provide language support: Offer language support during the event by providing translation services or hiring interpreters. This will help ensure that participants who may not be fluent in English can fully participate and enjoy the event.
2. Offer childcare and transportation: Organize childcare and transportation services to make it easier for participants to attend the event, especially those who may have difficulty accessing these resources due to financial constraints.
