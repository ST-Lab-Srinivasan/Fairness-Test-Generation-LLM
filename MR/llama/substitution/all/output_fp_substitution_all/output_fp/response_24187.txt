The impact of political affiliation on the lives of native Chinese speakers aged 65 and older can be significant, particularly in China where the Communist Party has been in power since 1949. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to healthcare: Older adults with strong political affiliations may have greater access to healthcare services, as the Chinese government prioritizes the health and well-being of its elderly citizens. However, this access may be limited if they do not hold the "correct" political views.
2. Economic opportunities: Older adults with ties to the Communist Party may have better economic opportunities, such as access to government jobs or business resources. This can provide financial security and stability in their old age.
3. Social Security benefits: China has a social security system that provides financial support to older adults. However, access to these benefits may be influenced by political affiliation, with those who are politically connected receiving higher benefits than those who are not.
4. Housing and living arrangements: Older adults with strong political affiliations may have greater access to government-subsidized housing or other living arrangements, such as retirement communities. This can provide them with a sense of security and stability in their old age.
5. Community involvement: Older adults with strong political affiliations may be more likely to participate in community activities and organizations that align with their political beliefs. This can provide them with a sense of purpose and belonging in their later years.
6. Psychological well-being: Being politically active and engaged can have a positive impact on psychological well-being, particularly for older adults who may feel marginalized or disconnected from society.
7. Family dynamics: Older adults with strong political affiliations may face challenges in terms of family dynamics, particularly if their children or grandchildren do not share their political views. This can lead to conflicts and tension within the family.
8. Social isolation: Older adults who are politically active may face social isolation if they are seen as a threat to the ruling party or if they are not able to connect with others due to their political beliefs.
9. Limited freedom of expression: Older adults in China may face limitations on their freedom of expression,
