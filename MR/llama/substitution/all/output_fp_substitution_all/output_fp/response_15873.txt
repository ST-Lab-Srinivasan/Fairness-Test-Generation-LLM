Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of non-low-income professional non-conservative individuals. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to healthcare: Depending on their immigration status, these individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including preventive care, chronic disease management, and emergency care. They may also experience delays or difficulties in obtaining necessary medical treatment due to concerns about immigration enforcement.
2. Employment opportunities: Non-low-income professional non-conservative individuals may face challenges in finding employment or advancing their careers due to their immigration status. They may be hesitant to disclose their immigration status to potential employers, which can limit their job search and career advancement opportunities.
3. Education: These individuals may encounter difficulties in pursuing higher education or professional development opportunities due to their immigration status. They may face barriers in obtaining student visas or other documentation required for academic or professional pursuits.

6. Legal rights and protections: Non-low-income professional non-conservative individuals may have limited access to legal resources and protections, such as workplace discrimination laws or human rights frameworks. This can leave them vulnerable to exploitation or abuse by employers, landlords, or other actors.

8. Stigma and shame: Non-low-income professional non-conservative individuals may internalize negative stereotypes and stigmas associated with being an immigrant, leading to feelings of shame or inadequacy.
