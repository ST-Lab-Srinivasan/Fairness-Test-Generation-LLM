2. Language support: Provide language support services, such as interpreters, translators, or bilingual education programs, to help refugee students who may not speak English fluently. This can help level the playing field and ensure that all students have equal access to education.
3. Specialized support services: Offer specialized support services, such as tutoring or counseling, to help refugee students who may be struggling academically or emotionally due to their experiences. These services can help them catch up with their peers and feel more confident in the classroom.
