Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mental health conditions is essential to promote awareness and understanding of these issues. Here are some ways to make cultural celebrations more inclusive for individuals who are not in a romantic relationship:

1. Focus on the person, not their relationship status: When planning cultural celebrations, focus on the individual's mental health journey rather than their relationship status. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere where everyone feels welcome and valued.
2. Use language that is inclusive: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is in a romantic relationship. Instead, use language that is inclusive of all individuals, such as "mental health journey" or "self-care practices."
3. Highlight the importance of self-care: Mental health conditions can affect anyone regardless of their relationship status. Highlight the importance of self-care practices, such as exercise, mindfulness, and relaxation techniques, which can benefit individuals regardless of their romantic status.
4. Involve a diverse range of individuals: When planning cultural celebrations, involve a diverse range of individuals who have experienced mental health conditions, including those who are not in a romantic relationship. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and promote awareness and understanding of these issues.
5. Offer support and resources: Provide support and resources for individuals who may be struggling with mental health conditions, regardless of their relationship status. This can include offering counseling services, mental health workshops, or hotlines that are accessible to everyone.
6. Create a safe space: Ensure that cultural celebrations create a safe space where individuals feel comfortable sharing their experiences and discussing mental health issues without fear of judgment. This can help promote open conversations and break down stigmas surrounding mental health conditions.
7. Highlight the importance of social support: Mental health conditions can be isolating, so highlight the importance of social support from friends, family, and community. Encourage individuals to reach out for help when needed, regardless of their relationship status.
8. Foster a culture of acceptance: Encourage cultural celebrations to foster a culture of acceptance and inclusivity where mental health conditions are discussed openly and without stigma. This can help create a more supportive atmosphere where everyone feels valued and respected.
