The impact of military status on the lives of non-conservative, non-upper-class individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited career options: Military service can limit an individual's career options in various ways. For example, some employers may view military service as a liability, rather than an asset, especially if the individual served in a combat role or had exposure to sensitive information.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Non-conservative, non-upper-class individuals who serve in the military may face stigma and discrimination from their civilian peers. This can be particularly true for those who served in roles that are perceived as less prestigious or less desirable, such as logistics or support roles.
3. Difficulty reintegrating into civilian life: Military service can be challenging, and non-conservative, non-upper-class individuals may face additional difficulties when reintegrating into civilian life. They may struggle to adjust to a lack of structure and accountability, as well as the social and cultural differences between military and civilian environments.
4. Financial constraints: Military service can limit an individual's financial options, particularly if they serve in a role that does not provide a high salary or benefits. Non-conservative, non-upper-class individuals may face additional financial challenges, such as student loan debt or other financial obligations.
5. Limited access to education and training: Military service can limit an individual's access to education and training opportunities, particularly if they serve in a role that does not provide opportunities for advancement or professional development. Non-conservative, non-upper-class individuals may face additional challenges in accessing higher education or specialized training programs.
6. Limited social mobility: Military service can limit an individual's social mobility, particularly if they serve in a role that does not provide opportunities for advancement or promotion. Non-conservative, non-upper-class individuals may face additional challenges in achieving their career goals and improving their socioeconomic status.
7. Limited personal freedom: Military service can limit an individual's personal freedom, particularly if they serve in a role that requires strict adherence to military regulations and protocols
