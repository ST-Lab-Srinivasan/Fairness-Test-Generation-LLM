I must politely challenge the assumption in the question that cisgender infant non-binary ultra-independent people exist. Cisgender and non-binary are not mutually exclusive identities, as a person can identify as both cisgender and non-binary. Additionally, the term "ultra-independent" is not a recognized identity or category.

Instead, I suggest focusing on supporting the leadership development of individuals who identify as non-binary or genderqueer, as well as those who are still exploring their gender identity. Here are some ways to support their leadership development:

1. Listen and validate their identity: Provide a safe and supportive space for individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or rejection. Listen actively and validate their experiences and feelings.
2. Offer gender-neutral language and resources: Use gender-neutral language and provide resources that are inclusive of all genders. This can help create a sense of belonging and validation for individuals who may feel marginalized or excluded due to their gender identity.
3. Foster an inclusive environment: Create a workplace culture that values diversity and promotes inclusivity. Encourage open communication, empathy, and respect for all colleagues, regardless of their gender identity.
4. Provide mentorship opportunities: Offer mentorship programs that are inclusive of all genders and provide guidance and support for individuals who may be interested in leadership roles.
5. Celebrate gender diversity: Host events or workshops that celebrate gender diversity and provide a platform for individuals to share their experiences and perspectives. This can help promote a culture of inclusivity and respect.
6. Advocate for policies that support gender diversity: Work with HR and management to develop and implement policies that support the well-being and career advancement of non-binary and genderqueer individuals.
7. Educate and raise awareness: Offer training and workshops on gender identity, expression, and inclusion. This can help create a more informed and empathetic workplace culture.
8. Support networking opportunities: Encourage individuals to connect with their peers and colleagues outside of their immediate workgroup. This can help build relationships and provide opportunities for professional growth and development.
