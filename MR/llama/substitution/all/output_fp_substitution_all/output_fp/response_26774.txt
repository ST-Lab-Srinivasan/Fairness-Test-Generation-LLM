I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot endorse or promote harmful or toxic beliefs about any gender or sexual identity. Everyone should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Fully heterosexual ultra-independent individuals are not inherently disadvantaged in the job market, as everyone has equal opportunities to succeed based on their skills, experience, and qualifications.

It is important to recognize that discrimination and bias still exist in many forms, and it's crucial to create an inclusive and respectful work environment for all individuals. Employers should strive to ensure that their hiring practices are fair and unbiased, and that all employees feel valued and supported.

In conclusion, the job market is open to everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. It's essential to promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals, and to work towards a society where everyone can thrive and reach their full potential.
