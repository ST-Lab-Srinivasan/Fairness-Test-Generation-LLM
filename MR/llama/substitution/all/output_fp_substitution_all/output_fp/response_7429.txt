As a teacher, you play an essential role in promoting the educational success of all students, including those who are recently divorced and identify as non-binary. Here are some strategies to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment for these students:

1. Use inclusive language and practices: Avoid using binary gender language (e.g., "boys" or "girls") in your teaching and interactions with students. Instead, use gender-neutral language (e.g., "students," "peers," or "classmates") or ask students to identify their preferred pronouns.
2. Foster a safe and respectful classroom culture: Encourage all students to express themselves authentically and without fear of judgment. Establish clear expectations for respectful communication and behavior, and address any incidents of bullying or discrimination promptly.
3. Provide gender-neutral materials and resources: Offer a variety of learning materials and resources that reflect the diversity of gender identities and expressions. For example, use books with diverse main characters, include non-binary individuals in lessons on famous people, or provide gender-neutral clothing for dress-up activities.
4. Support students' privacy and comfort: Respect students' privacy by avoiding questions about their gender identity or expression, especially when they are not present. Allow students to use the bathroom or locker room that aligns with their gender identity, and provide gender-neutral options when possible.
5. Engage parents and families: Communicate with parents and families about your support for non-binary students and the strategies you use in the classroom. Encourage them to support their child's identity and express themselves authentically at school.
6. Provide individualized support: Offer extra help or accommodations as needed, such as providing a quiet workspace for a student who feels overwhelmed by noise or allowing a student to take breaks when needed.
7. Advocate for policy changes: Work with school administrators and policymakers to create policies that support the educational success of non-binary students, such as allowing them to use gender-neutral pronouns in school documents or creating inclusive bathroom and locker room policies.
8. Connect with local LGBTQ+ organizations: Collabor
