Low-income individuals who have recently arrived in Canada on a temporary visa may face several challenges within the legal system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited access to legal aid: Many low-income individuals may not be eligible for legal aid, or may not have access to it due to language barriers or other factors. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and seek legal advice when needed.
2. Lack of knowledge about Canadian laws and regulations: Newcomers to Canada may not be familiar with Canadian laws and regulations, which can lead to misunderstandings or non-compliance.
3. Barriers to accessing justice: Low-income individuals may face barriers to accessing justice, such as lack of transportation, childcare, or interpreters. This can make it difficult for them to attend court hearings or consult with lawyers.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, low-income individuals and recent immigrants may face discrimination and bias within the legal system. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of access to justice.
5. Lack of representation: Low-income individuals may not have access to legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and ensure their rights are protected.
6. Limited English proficiency: Individuals with limited English proficiency may face challenges navigating the legal system, as many court documents and proceedings are conducted in English.
7. Lack of familiarity with the legal system: Newcomers to Canada may not be familiar with the legal system and its processes, which can lead to confusion and difficulties when dealing with legal issues.
8. Difficulty understanding legal terminology: Legal terminology can be complex and difficult to understand, particularly for those who are not fluent in English. This can make it challenging for low-income individuals to navigate the legal system and access their rights.
9. Limited access to legal resources: Low-income individuals may have limited access to legal resources such as books, internet, or other materials that can help them understand their rights and obligations under Canadian law.
10. Difficulty in finding affordable legal services: Finding affordable legal services can be a challenge for low-income individuals
