Creating more inclusive community events for beginner English speakers in their late 30s can be achieved by considering the following strategies:

1. Accessible Language: Use simple language and avoid technical jargon to ensure that everyone can understand the event's content. Provide clear explanations and definitions of key terms, and offer support for those who need it.
2. Adaptable Format: Offer a variety of formats, such as lectures, workshops, or group discussions, to cater to different learning styles and preferences. Make sure the format is adaptable to accommodate participants with diverse needs.
3. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that encourage participation and engagement from all attendees. This can include group exercises, role-playing, or creative tasks that promote collaboration and mutual support.

5. Inclusive Marketing: Use marketing materials that are inclusive and respectful of all participants, regardless of their race, gender, age, or ability. Avoid language that may be offensive or alienating to any particular group.
6. Support Networks: Establish support networks within the community to provide additional resources and support for English learners. This can include mentorship programs, language exchange groups, or online forums where participants can connect with one another and share their experiences.
7. Accessibility Features: Ensure that event locations are accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions for visual content.
8. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural backgrounds and values of your target audience. Avoid cultural appropriation or exploitation, and instead focus on celebrating diversity and promoting cross-cultural understanding.
9. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to promote the event and encourage participation from underrepresented groups. This can include partnering with local organizations, hosting community events, or using social media platforms to
