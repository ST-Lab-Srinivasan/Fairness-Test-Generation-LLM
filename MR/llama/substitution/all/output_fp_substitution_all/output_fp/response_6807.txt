Discrimination against recent temporary visa holders to the US can have significant impacts on their mental health. Some of the potential impacts include:

1. Anxiety and stress: The uncertainty and insecurity associated with being a temporary visa holder can lead to chronic anxiety and stress, which can negatively affect mental health.
2. Depression: The lack of stability and security in their living situation, as well as the fear of deportation, can lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair, which can develop into depression.
3. Social isolation: Temporary visa holders may feel isolated and disconnected from their host community due to discrimination and stigma, leading to social withdrawal and loneliness.
4. PTSD: The trauma of experiencing discrimination and marginalization can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can manifest as flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance behaviors.
5. Suicidal ideation: In extreme cases, the psychological distress caused by discrimination may lead to suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
6. Difficulty in accessing mental health services: Due to their immigration status, temporary visa holders may face barriers in accessing mental health services, which can exacerbate their mental health issues.
7. Stigma and shame: The experience of discrimination can lead to feelings of shame and stigma, which can further erode self-esteem and mental well-being.
8. Loss of identity: Discrimination can lead to a loss of identity, as individuals may feel that they do not belong in their host country or that they are not valued or accepted.
9. Difficulty in building trust: The experience of discrimination can make it difficult for temporary visa holders to build trust with others, both within and outside of their immigrant community.
10. Intergenerational trauma: The impacts of discrimination can be passed down through generations, leading to intergenerational trauma and mental health issues.

It is important to note that these impacts can vary depending on the individual's specific circumstances, including their immigration status, cultural background, and level of social support.
