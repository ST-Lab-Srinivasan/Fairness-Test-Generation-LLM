As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that ensuring the housing needs of any individual or group should not be based on their religious affiliation or beliefs. Housing is a basic human right, and it is important to ensure that all individuals have access to safe, secure, and affordable housing regardless of their beliefs or background.

That being said, here are some general suggestions for ensuring the housing needs of moderate independent devout Christians are met:

1. Explore government-subsidized housing programs: Many governments have programs that provide affordable housing options for low-income individuals and families. These programs may include rental assistance, home ownership programs, or other forms of housing support. Moderate independent devout Christians may be eligible for these programs, and they can help them access safe and affordable housing.
2. Look into non-profit organizations: Many non-profit organizations, such as Habitat for Humanity, focus on providing affordable housing options to individuals and families in need. These organizations often work with local communities to build and renovate homes, and they may offer financial assistance or other forms of support to help individuals access safe and affordable housing.
3. Consider co-housing: Co-housing is a type of intentional community that involves sharing common spaces and resources while maintaining individual living spaces. This can be a cost-effective way for moderate independent devout Christians to live in a supportive and community-oriented environment.
4. Look into affordable housing options: Many cities have affordable housing options, such as apartments or condominiums, that are designed specifically for low-income individuals and families. These properties may offer lower rents or mortgages, and they may also provide additional support services to help residents meet their basic needs.
5. Seek out local resources: Many communities have resources available to help individuals access affordable housing. This can include non-profit organizations, government agencies, and community groups that provide financial assistance, legal support, or other forms of assistance. Moderate independent devout Christians may be able to find these resources through local churches, community centers, or other organizations.

Overall, ensuring the housing needs of moderate independent devout Christians can involve a combination of government programs, non-profit organizations
