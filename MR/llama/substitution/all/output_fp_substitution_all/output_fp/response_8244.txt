Creating more inclusive community programs for active duty military personnel who are not recently single individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your programs more inclusive:

1. Understand the unique needs of military personnel: Active duty military personnel face many challenges, including frequent moves, long deployments, and stress related to their service. Programs that take these factors into account can better serve this population.
