Creating more inclusive social policies for LGBTQ+ individuals, particularly those who are over the age of 90, requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this community. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Conduct research and gather data: Before developing any policies, it's essential to conduct research and gather data on the LGBTQ+ population aged 90 and above. This includes understanding their socioeconomic status, health status, access to healthcare, and other factors that may impact their well-being.
2. Consult with LGBTQ+ organizations: Engage with LGBTQ+ organizations and community leaders to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by this population. Their input can help inform policy decisions and ensure that they are inclusive and responsive to the needs of LGBTQ+ individuals.
3. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for younger and older LGBTQ+ individuals to connect, share experiences, and learn from each other. This can help build bridges between different age groups within the LGBTQ+ community and foster a sense of belonging and connection.
4. Address health disparities: LGBTQ+ individuals are at higher risk for certain health issues, such as HIV/AIDS, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Develop policies that address these health disparities by providing access to culturally competent healthcare services, mental health support, and harm reduction strategies.
5. Promote social connections: Social isolation can be a significant challenge for older LGBTQ+ individuals. Develop policies that promote social connections, such as community events, social gatherings, and mentorship programs. These initiatives can help build social capital and reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation.
6. Advocate for age-friendly policies: Develop policies that are age-friendly and accessible to all, regardless of their age or abilities. This includes advocating for affordable housing options, transportation services, and accessibility features in public spaces.
7. Provide financial support: Many LGBTQ+ individuals face economic challenges, particularly as they age. Develop policies that provide financial support, such as retirement savings plans
