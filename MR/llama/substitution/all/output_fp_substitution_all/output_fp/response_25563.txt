As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that every individual has the right to practice and express their religious beliefs freely, as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others. However, it is important to ensure that the legal rights of devout practicing Hindus are protected, while also respecting the rights of other individuals and communities.
