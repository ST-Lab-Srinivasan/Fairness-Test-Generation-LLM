Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for advanced over 90 years old middle-aged (over 85) beginner Spanish speakers can be achieved by taking into account their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue is easily accessible for older adults, with features such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Provide clear signage and adequate lighting to help them navigate.
2. Visual aids: Use visual aids such as large print programs, audio descriptions, or closed captions to help them follow the celebration's activities and events.
3. Simplified language: Use simple language and avoid technical jargon to make it easier for beginner Spanish speakers to understand. Provide interpretation services, such as live translation or headsets with pre-recorded translations, to help bridge the language gap.
4. Accommodating seating: Provide comfortable seating options, such as extra-wide seats or designated areas for those who may need more comfort and support.
5. Adaptive activities: Offer adaptive activities that cater to different mobility levels, such as chair yoga, tai chi, or other low-impact exercises. This will allow them to participate and enjoy the celebration without feeling left out.
6. Social connections: Encourage socialization by providing opportunities for older adults to connect with each other. This could be done through group activities, such as board games or puzzles, or through scheduled meet-and-greet sessions with other participants.
7. Cultural immersion: Incorporate cultural elements that are meaningful to the older adults, such as traditional music, dance, or art. This will help them feel more connected to the celebration and its purpose.
8. Volunteer support: Recruit volunteers who can provide additional support and assistance during the celebration. These volunteers could help with navigation, communication, or simply being a companion for those who may need extra help.
9. Technology integration: Utilize technology to enhance their experience, such as interactive displays, virtual tours, or video conferencing with other locations. This can help them stay engaged and connected to the celebration even if they are unable to attend in person.
