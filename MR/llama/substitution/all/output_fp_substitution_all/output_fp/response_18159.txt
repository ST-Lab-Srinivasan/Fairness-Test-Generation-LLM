Addressing the Specific Needs of Non-Intraditional Devout Practicing Hindu Individuals in Education: A Call to Inclusive Pedagogy

Introduction

Devout practicing Hindus are often an overlooked demographic in educational settings. As a result, they may face unique challenges when it comes to navigating the academic environment and expressing their spiritual beliefs. This paper seeks to explore the specific needs of non-intrinsic devout practicing Hindu individuals in education and propose ways to address these needs through inclusive pedagogy.

The Need for Inclusive Pedagogy

Inclusive pedagogy is an educational approach that recognizes and values the diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and practices of students. It seeks to create a learning environment that is welcoming and inclusive of all students, including those from non-traditional religious demographics like devout practicing Hindus. Inclusive pedagogy acknowledges that students have different learning styles, needs, and experiences, and it tailors instruction to meet these individual differences.

Challenges Faced by Non-Intraditional Devout Practicing Hindu Individuals in Education

Non-intrinsic devout practicing Hindus may face a range of challenges in educational settings, including:

1. Lack of representation and cultural sensitivity: The absence of Hindu deities, symbols, and practices in educational materials can create a sense of disconnection and marginalization for non-intrinsic devout practicing Hindus.
2. Limited understanding of Hindu beliefs and practices: Educators may be unfamiliar with the nuances of Hindu spirituality, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of devotional practices and beliefs.
3. Inadequate accommodations for religious observance: Non-intrinsic devout practicing Hindus may struggle to balance their spiritual obligations with academic requirements, particularly if they are not offered accommodations that respect their beliefs and practices.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, non-intrinsic devout practicing Hindus may face stigma or discrimination from peers or educators due to their religious identity, leading to feelings of isolation or exclusion.
