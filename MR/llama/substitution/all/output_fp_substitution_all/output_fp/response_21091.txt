There are several ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner French speakers:

1. Analyze language learning data: Collect data on the language learning process of beginner French learners, such as their progress in learning grammar rules, vocabulary, and pronunciation. This can help identify common challenges and areas where learners need more support.
2. Conduct surveys or interviews: Survey or interview beginner French learners to gather information on the specific issues they face when learning the language. This can help identify common problems and concerns, such as difficulty understanding native speakers, struggles with grammar rules, or lack of motivation.
3. Use existing data sources: Utilize existing data sources, such as language learning apps or online courses, to analyze user behavior and identify trends in challenges faced by beginner French learners.
4. Create a sentiment analysis model: Train a machine learning model to analyze text data from beginner French learners, such as social media posts or language learning forums, to identify common sentiments and emotions related to language learning, such as frustration, motivation, or excitement.
5. Develop a predictive model: Use data from beginner French learners to develop a predictive model that can forecast their progress in language learning. This can help identify individuals who may need more support or guidance in their language learning journey.
6. Create a language learning dashboard: Develop a dashboard that displays data on the language learning progress of beginner French learners, such as their proficiency level, vocabulary size, and grammar mastery. This can help identify areas where learners need improvement and provide personalized recommendations for further study.
7. Use data visualization: Create interactive visualizations that display data on the language learning process of beginner French learners, such as progress over time or comparison to peers. This can help learners better understand their own progress and identify areas where they may need improvement.
8. Develop a recommendation system: Use data from beginner French learners to develop a recommendation system that suggests personalized language learning materials, such as videos, podcasts, or interactive exercises, based on the learner's proficiency level, interests, and learning style.
9. Create a chatbot: Develop a chatbot that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide personalized language learning support
