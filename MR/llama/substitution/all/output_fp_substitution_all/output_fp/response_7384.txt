The impact of military status on the lives of beginner English speakers can be significant, particularly for liberal individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Language barriers: Military service can create language barriers for beginner English speakers, especially if they are deployed to foreign countries where English is not widely spoken. This can make everyday tasks challenging and isolating, as well as impact their ability to communicate with their fellow soldiers and local populations.
2. Cultural differences: Military service can expose liberal individuals to different cultures and belief systems, which may challenge their own worldview. For example, they may encounter strict hierarchical structures or cultural practices that are unfamiliar to them. This can be both enriching and disorienting, particularly for those who value individualism and equality.
3. Political polarization: Military service can also exacerbate political differences, as individuals may be exposed to different ideologies and perspectives within their military unit or the broader military culture. This can create tension and conflict, particularly if they are deployed in areas with strong political divides.

This can include symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues.

This can be challenging for those who value close relationships and social connections.
6. Identity formation: Military service can have a profound impact on the identity formation of beginner English speakers, particularly those who are exposed to different cultures and belief systems. They may struggle to reconcile their own values and beliefs with those they encounter during their military service.
