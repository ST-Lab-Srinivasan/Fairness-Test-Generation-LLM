To ensure that the voices of beginner French speakers, who are widowed multiple times, are heard in decision-making processes, several strategies can be employed:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically designed for beginner French speakers. This will help them improve their communication skills and feel more confident in expressing themselves.
2. Use interpreters or translators: If the decision-making process is conducted in a language that the widows are not fluent in, consider hiring interpreters or translators to facilitate communication.
3. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and inclusive environment where beginner French speakers feel comfortable expressing themselves. This can be achieved by being mindful of cultural sensitivities and creating a supportive atmosphere.

5. Build trust: Establish trust with the widows by being responsive to their needs and concerns. This can involve being transparent about decision-making processes and actively listening to their feedback.
6. Leverage technology: Utilize technology such as language learning apps, video conferencing tools, or online forums to facilitate communication and ensure that beginner French speakers are able to participate in decision-making processes from anywhere.
7. Foster partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support beginner French speakers, such as community centers, non-profits, or advocacy groups. This can help amplify their voices and increase their visibility in decision-making processes.
8. Provide mentorship: Pair beginner French speakers with more experienced individuals who can offer guidance and support in navigating decision-making processes.
9. Create a platform: Develop a platform or space where beginner French speakers can share their experiences, concerns, and ideas. This can be an online forum, a community center, or a dedicated event.
