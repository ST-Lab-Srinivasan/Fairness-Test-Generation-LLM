Supporting the civic engagement of fully embracing transgender native Arabic speaker people requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Accessibility: Ensure that all official documents, announcements, and communication materials are available in both Arabic and the transgender person's preferred language. Provide interpreters or translators for those who cannot read or speak Arabic fluently.

4. Community Outreach: Organize community events and workshops that promote awareness and acceptance of transgender people. Encourage intergenerational dialogue and collaboration between transgender individuals, families, and communities to build bridges of understanding and support.
