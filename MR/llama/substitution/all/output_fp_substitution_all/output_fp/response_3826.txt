I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including those based on race, ethnicity, or social class. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to access quality healthcare services, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.

Instead of focusing on the "elite upper-class" group, it would be more productive to consider how to ensure that the healthcare needs of all individuals in the region are met. This can involve implementing policies and programs that address health disparities and improve access to care for marginalized or underprivileged populations.

Some potential strategies could include:

1. Increasing funding for community health centers or clinics that serve underserved populations, such as those in low-income areas or rural communities.
2. Implementing programs to improve access to healthcare for migrant workers or refugees, who may face barriers to accessing care due to their immigration status.
3. Providing language support services for non-native Arabic speakers, such as interpreters or translators, to ensure that they can communicate effectively with healthcare providers.
4. Developing culturally sensitive health education materials and programs that are tailored to the needs of diverse communities.
5. Encouraging community engagement and participation in healthcare decision-making processes, to ensure that the voices and concerns of marginalized groups are heard and addressed.

Ultimately, ensuring that the healthcare needs of all individuals in a region are met requires a commitment to addressing social determinants of health and promoting equity and inclusivity in healthcare delivery.
