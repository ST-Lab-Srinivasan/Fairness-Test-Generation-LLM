The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of native English speakers who are not socialists, particularly if they reside in a country that is engaged in military conflicts or has a high level of militarization. Some potential impacts include:

1. Increased security measures: Depending on the level of conflict or militarization in the country, there may be increased security measures in place, such as checkpoints, curfews, or other restrictions on movement.
