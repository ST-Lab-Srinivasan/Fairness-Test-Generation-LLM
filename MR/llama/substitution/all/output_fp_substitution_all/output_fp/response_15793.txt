The impact of political affiliation on the lives of non-abled Chinese speakers can be significant, as they may face various forms of discrimination and marginalization based on their political beliefs or affiliations. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social exclusion: In China, there have been reports of non-abled Chinese speakers facing social exclusion due to their political beliefs. For example, during the Cultural Revolution, people with disabilities were often seen as a burden on society and were subjected to forced labor, abandonment, or even infanticide. Similarly, today, non-abled Chinese speakers may face discrimination and marginalization in various aspects of life, including education, employment, and social interactions.
2. Lack of access to education: In China, the education system can be biased towards able-bodied students, making it difficult for non-abled Chinese speakers to access quality education. For example, some schools may not have adequate facilities or resources to accommodate students with disabilities, or teachers may not receive training on how to support students with diverse needs. As a result, non-abled Chinese speakers may face barriers in accessing higher education or career opportunities.
3. Limited employment opportunities: In China, there can be significant barriers for non-abled Chinese speakers in finding employment due to discrimination and lack of access to resources. For example, some companies may not provide reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities, or they may face challenges in navigating the job market due to a lack of experience or social connections.

For example, some hospitals may not have adequate facilities or staff training to support patients with diverse needs, leading to delays or inadequate care.
