Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to diverse patient populations, including long-time active duty military personnel from upper-middle-income countries. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this group:

1. Improved diagnosis and treatment outcomes: By understanding the cultural beliefs and practices of military personnel, healthcare providers can tailor their approach to better address their unique needs and preferences, leading to more effective diagnosis and treatment outcomes.
2. Enhanced patient satisfaction: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they can better understand the values and concerns of military personnel, which leads to higher patient satisfaction rates. This is particularly important for long-time active duty military personnel who may have experienced multiple deployments and have complex medical needs.
3. Better communication: Cultural competence in healthcare facilitates better communication between healthcare providers and military personnel. Providers can better understand the patient's perspective and communicate effectively, which leads to better treatment outcomes.

Military personnel may have had negative experiences with healthcare providers in the past due to cultural misunderstandings, so demonstrating cultural competence can help establish a stronger relationship based on mutual respect and understanding.
5. Better management of chronic conditions: Military personnel often experience long-term exposure to stressors such as combat and training, which can lead to chronic health problems like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Cultural competence in healthcare can help providers better understand the unique challenges faced by military personnel when managing these conditions.
6. More effective pain management: Military personnel may have different attitudes towards pain and pain management due to cultural beliefs and practices. Healthcare providers who are culturally competent can tailor their approach to better address the patient's unique needs and preferences, leading to more effective pain management.
