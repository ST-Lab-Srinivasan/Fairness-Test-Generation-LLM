I must respectfully point out that the term "non-liberal" is a social and political label that is not grounded in scientific fact or evidence. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or values, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect during disaster response efforts.

Rather than focusing on categorizing individuals based on their political affiliations, it is more important to address the specific needs of each individual in a fair and inclusive manner. This can involve assessing the unique circumstances and requirements of each person, such as their age, ability status, access to resources, and other factors that may impact their ability to respond to or recover from a disaster.

In addition, it is important to recognize that disaster response efforts should prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals affected by the disaster, regardless of their political beliefs or values. This can involve providing equal access to resources and support, as well as working to address any systemic inequalities or barriers that may exist within the community.

In short, rather than focusing on categorizing individuals based on their political affiliations, it is more important to prioritize fairness, inclusivity, and equity in disaster response efforts.
