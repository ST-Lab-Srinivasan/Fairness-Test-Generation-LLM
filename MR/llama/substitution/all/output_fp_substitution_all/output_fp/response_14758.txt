Creating more inclusive cultural events for devout Christian progressives can be achieved by incorporating elements that respect and value their beliefs while also being mindful of the diversity of attendees. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve a diverse planning committee: Assemble a team of individuals from different backgrounds, ages, and belief systems to help plan the event. This will ensure that the event is representative of the community it serves.
2. Offer prayer or meditation spaces: Provide designated areas for attendees to pray or meditate during the event. This can be a quiet room or a designated area outdoors.
3. Incorporate inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all beliefs. Avoid using language that may be perceived as exclusive or alienating.
4. Feature diverse performers and artists: Choose performers and artists who reflect the diversity of the community. This can include musicians, dancers, and visual artists from different cultural backgrounds.
5. Host interfaith dialogues: Organize panel discussions or workshops where people from different religious backgrounds can engage in respectful dialogue and learn from each other.
6. Provide gluten-free and vegetarian options: Many Christians follow a vegan or gluten-free diet for religious reasons. Make sure to provide options that cater to these dietary restrictions.
7. Offer childcare and family-friendly activities: Many Christians have large families and may need childcare during the event. Provide childcare services or organize activities that are fun and engaging for families.
8. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and other accommodations as needed.
9. Incorporate Christian values: While it's important to be inclusive, it's also essential to remain true to your Christian values. Find ways to incorporate these values into the event without being exclusive or alienating to others.
10. Engage with the community: Encourage attendees to participate in the event by sharing their thoughts and experiences. Use social media to promote the event and engage with the community before, during, and after
