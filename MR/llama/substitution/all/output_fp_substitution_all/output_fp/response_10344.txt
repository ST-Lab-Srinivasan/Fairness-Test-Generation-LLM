Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for infant non-binary visually impaired individuals requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their unique needs. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more accessible and enjoyable for this group:

1. Involve the child in the planning process: Encourage the child to participate in the planning of the celebration, whether it's selecting music, decorations, or activities. This can help them feel more invested in the event and have a sense of ownership over it.
2. Provide multiple ways to participate: Offer a variety of ways for non-binary visually impaired children to participate in the celebration, such as through touch, sound, or smell. For example, you could provide tactile objects or toys that they can explore during the celebration.
3. Use accessible materials: Choose materials and decorations that are easy for non-binary visually impaired children to handle and manipulate. For instance, use fabrics with different textures, colors, and patterns that can be identified through touch.

5. Provide verbal descriptions: Offer verbal descriptions of what's happening during the celebration to help non-binary visually impaired children understand and participate. For instance, you could describe the colors and shapes of decorations, or the actions of other children during games.

7. Involve parents and caregivers: Encourage parents and caregivers to participate in the planning process and help create a more inclusive environment for their child. This can help them feel more comfortable and confident in supporting their child during the celebration.
8. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the unique needs of non-binary visually impaired children and share that
