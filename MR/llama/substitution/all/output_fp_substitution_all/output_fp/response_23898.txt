To highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish speaker and beginner Chinese speaker individuals, you can use data in several ways:

1. Analysis of language learning statistics: You can analyze data on the number of people who start learning a new language, the number of people who drop out, and the number of people who reach different proficiency levels to identify trends and challenges faced by beginner learners. For example, you might find that many beginners struggle to advance beyond the intermediate level, or that a significant proportion of learners drop out within the first year of learning.
2. Survey research: You can conduct surveys among language learners to gather data on their experiences and challenges. For instance, you could ask learners about their motivation for learning the language, the resources they use, and the difficulties they face. This can help identify common issues faced by beginner learners, such as lack of practice opportunities or difficulty understanding grammar rules.
3. Corpus analysis: You can analyze large databases of texts in Spanish and Chinese to identify patterns and challenges faced by beginner learners. For example, you might find that beginner learners have difficulty with certain grammatical structures or vocabulary items, based on the frequency of their use in authentic language samples.
4. Case studies: You can conduct in-depth case studies of individual learners to gather detailed data on their language learning experiences and challenges. This can help identify unique issues faced by beginner learners, such as difficulties with pronunciation or comprehension, and provide insights into how these issues can be addressed.
5. Machine learning: You can use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of language learning data, including data on beginner learners. For example, you might use machine learning to identify patterns in learner language that indicate difficulty with certain grammar structures or vocabulary items.
6. User behavior analysis: You can analyze user behavior data from language learning apps or online resources to identify trends and challenges faced by beginner learners. For instance, you might find that many beginners spend most of their time on basic vocabulary and grammar, rather than moving on to more advanced topics.
7. Neural networks: You can use neural networks to analyze large datasets of language learning data, including data on beginner learners. For example, you might use a neural network to identify patterns in learner language that indicate difficulty with
