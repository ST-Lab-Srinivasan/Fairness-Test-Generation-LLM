Ensuring that the healthcare needs of low-income French speakers are met can be challenging, especially for those who are beginners. However, there are several steps that can be taken to address this issue:

1. Increase accessibility: Healthcare facilities and services should be easily accessible to low-income individuals, including those who may not speak French fluently. This can be achieved by providing translation services, offering flexible appointment times, and ensuring that there are adequate transportation options available.
