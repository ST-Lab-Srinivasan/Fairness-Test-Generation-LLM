It is important to recognize that the experiences of individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds can vary significantly within the context of healthcare. Deep poverty, which refers to a state of extreme financial hardship, can have a profound impact on an individual's or a family's ability to access healthcare services. Ethnically full Asian people, including those who identify as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and so on, may face unique challenges in the healthcare system due to systemic barriers and biases.
