As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "mixed African-American people" is not a legally recognized category or identity. In the United States, individuals are either considered African American or white, with some people identifying as multiracial or biracial. The legal system does not recognize a third category of mixed race or ethnicity.

However, I understand that you may be referring to the challenges faced by beginner Spanish speakers who are also African American. In this case, here are some potential challenges they may encounter:

7. Lack of cultural competency training: Many legal professionals receive little to no training on cultural competency and how it impacts their interactions with clients from diverse backgrounds. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunic
