Creating more inclusive housing policies for active-duty children is essential to ensure that they have access to safe and affordable housing, regardless of their parent's military status. Here are some ways to create more inclusive housing policies for active-duty children:

1. Expand Eligibility Criteria: Housing policies should be expanded to include all active-duty children, regardless of their parents' rank or length of service. This includes children of reserve and National Guard members, as well as those whose parents are retired or separated from the military.
2. Prioritize Military Families: When allocating housing resources, prioritize families with active-duty members, especially those who are deployed or have been injured in service. This can include providing additional support and resources to help them find and maintain affordable housing.
3. Offer Financial Assistance: Provide financial assistance to active-duty children and their families to help them cover the costs of housing, including down payments, closing costs, and ongoing expenses such as rent or mortgage payments.
4. Develop Military-Friendly Housing Options: Develop housing options that are specifically designed for military families, with features such as pet-friendly communities, easy access to military bases and installations, and amenities that cater to the unique needs of service members and their families.
5. Streamline PCS Moves: Make the process of moving during a permanent change of station (PCS) easier for active-duty children by providing assistance with relocation costs, including transportation, storage, and housing setup.
6. Provide Housing Stability: Ensure that active-duty children have access to stable and secure housing by offering long-term leases or mortgages, rather than short-term rentals or subleases. This can help reduce the stress and uncertainty associated with frequent moves.
7. Offer Support Services: Provide support services to active-duty children and their families, such as financial counseling, legal aid, and mental health resources. These services can help them navigate the challenges of military life and ensure that they have access to the resources they need to thrive.
8. Collaborate with Military Organizations: Work closely with military organizations and advocacy groups to better understand
