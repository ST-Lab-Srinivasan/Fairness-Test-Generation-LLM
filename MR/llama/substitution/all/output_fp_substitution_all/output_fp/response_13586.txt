Supporting elderly individuals, especially those over the age of 90, can be challenging due to various physical, cognitive, and social changes that occur with aging. Here are some effective strategies for supporting advanced older native English speakers (over 85) communities:

1. Age-friendly environments: Create communities that are safe, accessible, and comfortable for older adults. This includes adapting living spaces to meet their needs, providing clear signage and wayfinding, and ensuring easy access to amenities such as transportation, healthcare, and social activities.
2. Social connections: Older adults often experience social isolation, which can negatively impact mental and physical health. Encourage social connections by organizing group activities, volunteering opportunities, and providing transportation to social events.
3. Cognitive stimulation: Engage older adults in cognitively stimulating activities such as puzzles, brain games, and creative hobbies to help maintain cognitive function and reduce the risk of dementia.
4. Physical activity: Encourage physical activity through exercise programs, walking groups, or other recreational activities to improve physical health and mobility.
5. Health monitoring and management: Provide regular health check-ups and monitor chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and dementia. Offer education and support on managing these conditions and making healthy lifestyle choices.
6. Mental health support: Provide mental health services such as counseling and therapy to help older adults cope with stress, anxiety, and depression.
7. Nutrition and hydration: Ensure that older adults are receiving adequate nutrition and staying hydrated through proper dietary planning and access to healthy food options.
8. Home care and support: Provide home care services such as personal care, housekeeping, and meal preparation to help older adults maintain their independence and quality of life.
9. Transportation: Provide transportation services to enable older adults to access medical appointments, social events, and other activities.
10. Community outreach and education: Educate the community on the needs and concerns of older adults, and provide resources and support for their caregivers
