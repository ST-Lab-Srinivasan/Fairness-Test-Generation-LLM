Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of permanent resident natural-born US citizens. Here are some ways:

1. Identity formation: Cultural heritage helps shape an individual's identity, including their values, beliefs, and practices. As a US citizen, an individual may identify with certain cultural traditions, such as Thanksgiving or the 4th of July, which are deeply rooted in American history and culture.
2. Community building: Cultural heritage can bring people together and create a sense of community among individuals who share similar backgrounds and experiences. For example, cultural festivals and events can provide opportunities for people to connect with others who have similar cultural practices and traditions.
3. Preservation of history: Cultural heritage helps preserve the history of a particular group or community. By passing down cultural traditions and practices from one generation to the next, individuals help keep their cultural heritage alive and relevant.
4. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For example, US citizens who share a common cultural background may feel more connected to their community and country as a whole.
5. Pride in ancestry: Cultural heritage can also evoke feelings of pride in one's ancestry and the achievements of their ancestors. For instance, many US citizens take pride in their European or African ancestry, which has contributed to the development of American culture.
6. Understanding of diversity: Cultural heritage can help individuals understand and appreciate the diversity of cultures within a society. By learning about different cultural traditions and practices, individuals can develop empathy and respect for the cultural differences that exist among people.
7. Connection to ancestral lands: For some US citizens, cultural heritage may also involve a connection to ancestral lands or territories. This can be particularly true for indigenous peoples who have a deep spiritual and cultural connection to their traditional territories.
8. Shaping of social norms: Cultural heritage can shape social norms and values within a society. For example, the shared cultural values of hard work, individualism, and self-reliance are deeply ingrained in American culture and influence social interactions and expectations.
9. Economic development: Cultural heritage can also play a role in economic development, particularly through tourism.
