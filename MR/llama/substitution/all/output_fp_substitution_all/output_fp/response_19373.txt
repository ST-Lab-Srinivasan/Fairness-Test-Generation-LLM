5. Use your voice: Share your personal story or the stories of others to highlight the issues facing undocumented communities. Utilize social media, writing, or public speaking to amplify the voices of these individuals and bring attention to their experiences.
6. Collaborate with other advocacy groups: Build alliances with organizations that support immigrant rights, racial justice, and civil rights. Together, you can create a more robust movement for change.
