Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. In Nigeria, where traditional and cultural values are deeply ingrained, the institution of marriage is highly valued and seen as a critical step in an individual's journey towards adulthood. However, early pregnancy can pose significant challenges for young couples, particularly those in their first trimester. This study aimed to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant Nigerian individuals during their first trimester.

Methodology:
This study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A total of 100 recently pregnant Nigerian women were recruited from two hospitals in Lagos State, Nigeria. Participants were randomly selected from the outpatient clinics of the hospitals and were aged between 18 and 35 years. Data were collected through interviews with the participants and their spouses/partners, if applicable, using a semi-structured questionnaire. The questionnaire covered topics such as demographics, marital status, pregnancy complications, and social support networks.

Results:
The results of the study revealed that marital status had a significant impact on the lives of recently pregnant Nigerian individuals during their first trimester. Specifically, married participants reported higher levels of social support compared to unmarried participants. Married participants also reported fewer pregnancy complications and better prenatal care compared to unmarried participants. On the other hand, unmarried participants reported greater emotional stress and feelings of isolation during their first trimester.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study highlight the significant impact of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant Nigerian individuals during their first trimester. Marriage was found to provide a supportive network and improve prenatal care, leading to better pregnancy outcomes. Unmarried participants, however, experienced greater emotional stress and feelings of isolation, which may have negative implications for their pregnancies. These findings underscore the importance of marriage in enhancing the well-being of young couples during early pregnancy.
