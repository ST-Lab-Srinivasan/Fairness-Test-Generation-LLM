Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty employed people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Understand the needs of military personnel: Research the unique challenges faced by active-duty military personnel, such as frequent moves, long work hours, and deployment. Design your events with their needs in mind, such as scheduling events during non-peak hours or providing flexible attendance options.
2. Offer childcare and transportation: Military families often struggle with finding quality childcare and transportation. Provide on-site childcare services or partner with local organizations to offer these amenities. Additionally, consider offering free or low-cost transportation options for attendees who may not have access to reliable transportation.
3. Involve military spouses in the planning process: Military spouses are often overlooked when it comes to community events. Involve them in the planning process by soliciting input and feedback on what they would like to see at the event. This can help ensure that the event is tailored to their needs and interests.
4. Provide flexible pricing options: Military personnel often have limited financial resources due to deployments, training, or other military-related expenses. Offer flexible pricing options, such as sliding scale fees or pay-what-you-can structures, to make the event more accessible to a wider range of attendees.
5. Host events during non-peak hours: Military personnel often have limited time outside of work due to their duties. Consider hosting events during non-peak hours, such as evenings or weekends, to accommodate their schedules.
6. Offer virtual attendance options: For military personnel who are unable to attend in person, consider offering virtual attendance options, such as live streaming the event or providing a recording after the fact. This can help ensure that everyone has access to the information and resources provided at the event.
7. Create a welcoming environment: Military personnel may feel uncomfortable attending events outside of their military community. Create a welcoming environment by incorporating elements that are familiar to them, such as patriotic decorations or military-themed activities.
8. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support specifically tailored to the needs
