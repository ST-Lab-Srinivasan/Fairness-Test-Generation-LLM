As a native Chinese speaker and recent green card holder to the US, there may be several challenges you face in the legal system. Here are some potential issues:

1. Language barrier: Depending on where you live in the US, you may encounter language barriers when interacting with law enforcement officers, court officials, or legal professionals. While many courts and legal services offer interpreters, it's essential to be aware of your rights and communicate clearly about any linguistic challenges you face.
