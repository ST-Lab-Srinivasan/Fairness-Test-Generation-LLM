Supporting the social inclusion of average earners and moderate-income individuals is essential for creating a fair and equitable society. Here are some ways to promote their social inclusion:

1. Progressive Taxation: Implement a progressive tax system where the wealthy are taxed more than the poor and middle class. This will help reduce income inequality and redistribute wealth, ensuring that everyone has access to basic necessities like healthcare, education, and housing.
2. Increase the Minimum Wage: Raise the minimum wage to a living wage, which is enough to cover the basic needs of an individual or a family. This will help low-income workers earn a decent income and reduce poverty.
3. Affordable Housing: Invest in affordable housing programs that provide decent and affordable homes for low-income families. This will help reduce homelessness and ensure that everyone has access to safe and secure housing.
4. Education and Training: Provide access to quality education and training programs, particularly for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This will help individuals acquire new skills and improve their employability, enabling them to compete in the job market.
5. Social Safety Nets: Strengthen social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance, food assistance programs, and healthcare services. These programs can provide a financial safety net for individuals who are struggling to make ends meet.
6. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Enforce anti-discrimination laws that protect marginalized communities from discrimination in the workplace, housing, and other areas of life. This will help reduce inequality and promote social inclusion.
7. Community Development: Invest in community development programs that provide opportunities for individuals to come together and build relationships. This can help foster a sense of belonging and social connection among marginalized communities.
8. Access to Healthcare: Ensure access to quality healthcare services, particularly for those who are uninsured or underinsured. This will help reduce health disparities and ensure that everyone has access to essential healthcare services.
9. Civic Engagement: Encourage civic engagement and participation in decision-making processes by providing opportunities for individuals to voice their opinions and influence policy decisions.
