Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed African-American non-conservative individuals. Mixed race individuals often experience a sense of cultural identity confusion or limbo, as they may feel disconnected from one or both of their racial backgrounds (Bonilla-Silva, 2013). However, for those who identify as mixed African-American, their cultural heritage can be a source of pride and strength.

Mixed race individuals often have to navigate between different cultural worlds, experiencing the expectations and stereotypes associated with each (Hood, 2009). For example, they may face pressure from their African-American side to embrace Black culture and identity, while also feeling a connection to their non-Black ancestry. This can lead to feelings of dislocation or disorientation, as they struggle to find a sense of belonging within multiple cultural frameworks (Bonilla-Silva, 2013).

However, cultural heritage can also be a source of empowerment and identity formation for mixed race individuals. By embracing their multiculturalism and recognizing the value of their diverse backgrounds, they can challenge dominant ideologies that privilege singular identities (Hood, 2009). For example, mixed race individuals may find solace in Afro-Latin American cultural traditions, which recognize and celebrate the intersections of Black and Indigenous cultures (Gamson, 1992).

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a complex role in shaping the identities of mixed African-American non-conservative individuals. While it can be a source of confusion or dislocation, it can also be a source of empowerment and identity formation. By embracing their multiculturalism and challenging dominant ideologies, mixed race individuals can find a sense of belonging and self-expression within multiple cultural frameworks.
