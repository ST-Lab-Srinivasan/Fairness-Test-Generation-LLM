As a native French speaker and a natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that I may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Language barrier: As a non-native English speaker, I may struggle with the language used in legal documents, court proceedings, and legal terminology. This can make it difficult for me to fully understand my rights and responsibilities under the law.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in the US is based on common law, which may differ from the civil law system used in France. As a result, I may find some of the legal concepts and practices unfamiliar or misunderstood.
3. Lack of familiarity with US laws: As a native French speaker who was born and raised in France, I may not be familiar with the specific laws and regulations in the US. This can make it difficult for me to navigate the legal system and understand my rights and responsibilities.
4. Bias or discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a lot of bias and discrimination towards non-native English speakers in the legal system. As a result, I may face additional challenges when trying to access legal services or navigate the court system.

6. Difficulty navigating the court system: The court system in the US can be complex and confusing, especially for someone who is not familiar with it. As a result, I may find it difficult to navigate the system and understand how to proceed with legal matters.
7. Lack of trust in the legal system: As a non-native English speaker, I may feel less comfortable interacting with the legal system and may be less likely to trust it. This can make it more difficult for me to access legal services and navigate the court system.
