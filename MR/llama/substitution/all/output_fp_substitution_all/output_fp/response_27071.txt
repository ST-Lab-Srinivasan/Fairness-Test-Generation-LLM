As a language model, I cannot endorse or suggest any specific legislative changes that may benefit a particular community or group of people. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how legislation could be improved to support and promote inclusivity for native English speaker visually impaired communities:

1. Accessible Communication: Ensure that all forms of communication, including written documents, signage, and digital media, are accessible to individuals with visual impairments through the use of clear and simple language, high contrast colors, and assistive technologies such as screen readers.
2. Education and Awareness: Provide training and resources for educators, employers, and healthcare professionals on how to support and accommodate individuals with visual impairments in various settings. This could include workshops on accessible communication, technology, and inclusive practices.
3. Employment Opportunities: Encourage the creation of job opportunities that cater specifically to the needs of native English speaker visually impaired communities. This could involve working with organizations that provide job training and placement services tailored to individuals with visual impairments.
4. Healthcare Accessibility: Ensure that healthcare facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and medical offices, are accessible and inclusive for individuals with visual impairments. This could involve providing audio descriptions of medical equipment, Braille labels on medication bottles, and large print or audio materials for patient education.
5. Public Transportation: Improve public transportation systems to be more accessible and user-friendly for individuals with visual impairments. This could involve installing audio signals for bus stops, subway stations, and train platforms, as well as providing accessible routes and scheduling information.
6. Housing Accessibility: Ensure that housing options are available and accessible to native English speaker visually impaired communities. This could involve working with developers and landlords to create more accessible housing units, such as those with wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio signals for doorbells and alarm systems.
7. Social Inclusion: Encourage social inclusion by promoting events and activities that cater to native English speaker visually impaired communities. This could involve partnering with organizations to host accessible cultural events, such as concerts, art exhibits, or sport
