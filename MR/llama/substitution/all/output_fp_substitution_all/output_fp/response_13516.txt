The healthcare system faces various challenges when it comes to serving patients who are native Arabic speakers and native Spanish speakers. Here are some of the common challenges that these individuals may encounter:

Challenges faced by Native Arabic Speakers:

1. Language Barriers: Communication is a crucial aspect of healthcare, and language barriers can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications. Arabic speakers may struggle to communicate their symptoms or medical history to healthcare providers who are not fluent in Arabic.
