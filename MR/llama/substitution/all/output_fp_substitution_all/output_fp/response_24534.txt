As a socially responsible AI language model, I appreciate your interest in creating more inclusive community programs for recently single, multiple times ultra-liberal individuals. Here are some suggestions on how to design and implement such programs:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct research or surveys to gather information about the interests, values, and lifestyles of the target group. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their specific needs and create a more inclusive environment.
2. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming atmosphere where individuals feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. Encourage open communication, active listening, and mutual respect among participants.
3. Offer diverse activities and workshops: Provide a range of activities that cater to the different interests and needs of the target group. This could include art classes, fitness sessions, book clubs, or volunteer opportunities. Ensure that the activities are inclusive and accessible to all participants.
4. Support mental health and well-being: Recognize that being single multiple times can be emotionally challenging, especially for those who identify as ultra-liberal. Offer mental health workshops or provide access to counseling services to support participants' emotional well-being.
5. Encourage intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for older and younger individuals to connect, learn from each other, and build meaningful relationships. This can help break down age-related barriers and promote a sense of community.
6. Foster social connections: Organize events or activities that bring participants together in a relaxed and enjoyable setting. Encourage mingling and socializing to help individuals form new connections and friendships.
7. Provide safe spaces for vulnerable groups: Ensure that your programs are inclusive of all gender identities, sexual orientations, and races/ethnicities. Create safe spaces for participants who may feel marginalized or excluded in mainstream society.
8. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local community centers, libraries, or other organizations to reach a broader audience and leverage their resources and expertise. This can help you create more comprehensive and effective programs.
9. Evaluate and improve programs regularly
