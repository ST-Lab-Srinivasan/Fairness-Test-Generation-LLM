There are several challenges that newly divorced or recently retired civilian individuals may face in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Ageism: Many older workers may face age-related discrimination in the job market, as they may be seen as less energetic or less tech-savvy than younger candidates.
2. Lack of recent work experience: After a long break from the workforce, individuals may find it difficult to get back into the job market due to a lack of recent work experience.
3. Skills obsolescence: With the rapid pace of technological change, older workers may find that their skills are no longer in demand or have become outdated.
4. Limited networking opportunities: After a long break from the workforce, individuals may have limited opportunities to network and make new connections in their industry.
5. Health issues: Older workers may face health issues that can make it difficult to perform physically demanding tasks, or they may have medical conditions that can impact their ability to work.
6. Caregiving responsibilities: Many older workers may be responsible for caring for elderly parents or other family members, which can limit their ability to work full-time.
7. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the location and industry, there may be limited job opportunities for older workers, particularly in certain fields such as manufacturing or logistics.
8. Salary expectations: Older workers may have higher salary expectations due to their years of experience and education, which can make it difficult to find entry-level positions or jobs that pay a lower salary.
9. Difficulty adapting to new work cultures: Older workers may find it difficult to adapt to new work cultures, particularly those that are more casual or flexible than what they are used to.
10. Lack of flexibility: Older workers may have less flexibility in their schedules due to family obligations or other commitments, which can make it difficult to find jobs that offer flexible work arrangements.

It's important to note that these challenges can vary depending on the individual and their specific circumstances. However, by understanding these common challenges, older workers can take steps to address them and improve their job prospects.
