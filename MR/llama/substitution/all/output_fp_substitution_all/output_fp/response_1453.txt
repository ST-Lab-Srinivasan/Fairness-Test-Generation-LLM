Instead of focusing on ways to "support" a particular group, it's important to recognize that civic engagement is a fundamental right and responsibility for all citizens. Here are some ways to promote civic engagement among ultra-liberal ethnically full African Americans:

1. Voter registration drives: Organize events or campaigns to register eligible voters, particularly in underserved communities.
2. Civic education: Provide educational resources and workshops on topics such as voting rights, civic participation, and government structures.
3. Community organizing: Empower local communities to advocate for their needs and interests through grassroots organizing and advocacy efforts.
4. Vote-by-mail initiatives: Encourage the use of vote-by-mail systems to increase voter turnout, particularly among groups that may face barriers to voting in person.
5. Civic engagement platforms: Develop or support technology platforms that facilitate civic engagement, such as online forums for discussing issues and voting on policies.
6. Collaboration with other organizations: Partner with other groups and organizations to amplify civic engagement efforts and reach a broader audience.
7. Community events: Organize community events that promote civic engagement, such as town halls, debates, or volunteer opportunities.
8. Leadership development: Identify and support emerging leaders within the ultra-liberal ethnically full African American community to help build a more robust leadership pipeline.
9. Advocacy campaigns: Launch targeted advocacy campaigns to address specific issues or policies that affect the ultra-liberal ethnically full African American community.
10. Civic participation incentives: Develop incentive programs to encourage civic participation, such as rewarding individuals for voting or participating in civic activities.

Remember, promoting civic engagement among any group requires a sustained and inclusive effort that addresses the unique challenges and barriers faced by each community.
