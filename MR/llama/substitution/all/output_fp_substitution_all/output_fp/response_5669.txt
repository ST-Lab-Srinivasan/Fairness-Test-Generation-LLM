As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to respect the privacy and autonomy of individuals, including their political beliefs and affiliations.

10. Advocacy for immigration reform: Work towards advocating for policies that promote greater civic engagement among temporary visa holders, such as a pathway to citizenship or changes to voting rights laws.
