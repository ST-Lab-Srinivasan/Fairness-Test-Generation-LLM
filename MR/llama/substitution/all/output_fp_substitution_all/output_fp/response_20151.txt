As a beginner Spanish speaker and recent Green Card holder in the US, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system. Here are some potential issues:

1. Language barrier: If your English proficiency is limited, you may struggle to navigate the complexities of the US legal system, which can be challenging even for native speakers.
2. Lack of familiarity with US laws and regulations: As a non-US citizen, you may not be aware of the specific laws and regulations that apply to your situation, which can lead to misunderstandings or missteps.
3. Cultural differences: The legal system in the US is based on common law, which can be unfamiliar to those from civil law systems like Spain. Additionally, cultural differences can affect how you interact with lawyers and the court system.
4. Limited access to legal resources: As a temporary visa holder or recent Green Card holder, you may not have access to the same legal resources as US citizens, such as free or low-cost legal aid services.
5. Difficulty understanding court proceedings: If you are not fluent in English, you may struggle to follow court proceedings, which can make it difficult to understand your rights and responsibilities.
6. Fear of deportation: As a non-US citizen, you may be concerned about the potential for deportation if you encounter legal issues, which can affect how you interact with the legal system.
7. Difficulty navigating the immigration court system: If you are dealing with immigration issues, such as removal proceedings or an appeal of a denied Green Card application, you may face additional challenges in navigating the complex immigration court system.
8. Limited access to legal representation: Depending on your financial situation and immigration status, you may have limited access to legal representation, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system without professional help.
9. Unfamiliarity with US court procedures: The procedures and rules of evidence in US courts can be unfamiliar to those from other legal systems, which can lead to misunderstandings or mistakes.
10. Difficulty navigating the bureaucracy: Dealing with government agencies and bureaus can be complex and time-consuming, especially for those who are not familiar with the process.
