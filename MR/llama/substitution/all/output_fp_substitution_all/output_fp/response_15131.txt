Supporting the economic empowerment of lower-class Native natural-born US citizen individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses systemic barriers and provides opportunities for education, training, and entrepreneurship. Here are some strategies that can help:

This could include vocational training, apprenticeships, and certification programs in high-demand fields such as technology, healthcare, and skilled trades.

4. Access to affordable housing: Work towards providing affordable housing options in urban and rural areas to help lower-class Native individuals access safe and decent living conditions.
5. Addressing systemic barriers: Advocate for policies that address systemic barriers such as discrimination, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and inadequate infrastructure in Native American communities.
6. Entrepreneurship support: Provide resources and support for entrepreneurs in lower-class Native communities through incubators, accelerators, and other programs that can help them start and grow their businesses.
7. Community development: Invest in community development projects that provide job opportunities, improve infrastructure, and promote economic growth in Native American communities.
8. Collaboration with local governments: Work with local governments to develop policies and programs that support the economic empowerment of lower-class Native individuals.
