Addressing the specific needs of ethnically full Asian individuals who have not been divorced for a long time in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, cultural backgrounds, and socio-economic status.

2. Recognize and address language barriers: Many ethnically full Asians may face language barriers, particularly if they are recent immigrants or refugees. Provide interpreters or translators in schools to help bridge this gap and ensure that students receive equal access to education.
