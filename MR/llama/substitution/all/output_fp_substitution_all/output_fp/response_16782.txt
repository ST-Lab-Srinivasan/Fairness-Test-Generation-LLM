Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs include diverse perspectives and representation of different Asian cultures. This can be achieved by including stories, music, and traditions from various countries and communities within Asia.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes specific Asian groups. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures. For example, use "Asian" instead of "Chinese" or "Japanese" to refer to the entire continent.
3. Provide cultural context: Offer cultural context and background information on the traditions and customs being presented. This can help beginner Chinese speakers understand the significance and richness of the culture they are learning.
4. Engage with the community: Collaborate with local Asian communities to develop and implement cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are culturally appropriate and sensitive to the needs of the community.
5. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage beginner Chinese speakers to learn about and appreciate different cultures within Asia. This can be done through intercultural dialogue, cultural events, and collaborative projects that promote mutual understanding and respect.
6. Provide opportunities for participation: Offer opportunities for beginner Chinese speakers to participate in cultural activities, such as language exchange programs, cultural festivals, or community events. This can help them feel more connected to the culture and community they are learning about.
7. Address barriers to access: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to all beginner Chinese speakers, regardless of their socio-economic background or location. Provide resources and support for those who may face barriers to participation, such as transportation or childcare.
8. Incorporate technology: Utilize technology to provide access to cultural resources and information, such as online language learning platforms, cultural podcasts, or virtual cultural events. This can help reach a wider audience and make cultural programs more accessible.
9. Foster partnerships: Develop partnerships with local organizations, community groups, and educational institutions to promote cross-cultural understanding and collaboration
