5. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and accessibility in community programs. This can include working with government agencies, organizations, and advocacy groups to raise awareness and promote change.
6. Collaboration: Collaborate with other organizations and stakeholders to develop and deliver programs that are tailored to the needs of individuals with genetic conditions. This can include partnering with healthcare providers, community organizations, and government agencies.
7. Inclusive Programming: Develop programming that is inclusive of individuals with genetic conditions, such as providing accommodations for individuals who may need them, and incorporating activities that are accessible to all participants.
8. Cultural Competency: Ensure that program materials and messaging are culturally competent and sensitive to the diverse backgrounds and experiences of individuals with genetic conditions.
9. Participatory Design: Involve individuals with genetic conditions in the design and delivery of programs, through participatory methods such as co-design and co-delivery. This can help ensure that programs are responsive to the needs and preferences of individuals with genetic conditions.
