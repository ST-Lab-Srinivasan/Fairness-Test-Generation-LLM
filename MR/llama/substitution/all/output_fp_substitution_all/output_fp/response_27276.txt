Highlighting the issues faced by straight widows or widowers after their spouse's death is crucial, as these individuals often face unique challenges that are not as well-known or recognized as those experienced by other grieving populations. Here are some ways data can be used to shed light on these issues:

1. Quantify the impact of spouse loss: Use data to quantify the economic and emotional impact of a spouse's death on individuals, including factors such as lost income, increased healthcare costs, and decreased social security benefits.
