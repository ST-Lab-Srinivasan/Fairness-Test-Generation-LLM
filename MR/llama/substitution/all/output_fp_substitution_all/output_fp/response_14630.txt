1. Inclusive Data Collection: Collect data on the experiences and needs of ethnically full African Americans with disabilities, including their access to healthcare, education, employment, and other services. This data will help inform policy decisions and ensure that policies are responsive to the needs of this community.

Disability Rights Education and Advocacy: Provide training and resources for ethnically full African American individuals with disabilities, as well as their families and caregivers, on how to advocate for their rights and access available resources. This can include information on how to navigate the healthcare system, obtain accommodations in education, and access employment opportunities.
3. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for service providers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to help them understand the experiences and needs of ethnically full African Americans with disabilities. This can include training on issues such as racial disparities in healthcare, education, and employment, as well as strategies for addressing these disparities.

This can involve participating in community events, conducting focus groups and surveys, and partnering with community-based organizations.

Policy Reforms: Advocate for policies that address the systemic barriers faced by ethnically full African Americans with disabilities, such as lack of access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. This can include policy reforms related to healthcare, education, employment, and social welfare programs.
