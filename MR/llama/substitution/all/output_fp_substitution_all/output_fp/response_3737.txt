As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their genetic makeup or background, should be treated with dignity and respect. However, I understand the context of your question and will provide some ways to support the civic engagement of natural-born Canadian citizen without known genetic conditions:

1. Encourage voting: Provide information on the voting process, candidates, and issues to help them make informed decisions at the polls. Offer assistance with absentee or mail-in ballots for those who cannot vote in person due to disability or mobility issues.
2. Offer educational resources: Provide access to non-partisan educational resources that explain the voting process, democratic values, and the role of civic engagement in a healthy democracy. This could include interactive modules, videos, or online courses.
3. Facilitate community involvement: Encourage them to participate in local events, volunteer opportunities, or community organizations that align with their interests and values. This can help build connections within the community and foster a sense of belonging.
4. Promote advocacy efforts: Support them in advocating for issues that matter to them, whether it's through writing letters to elected officials, participating in protests or rallies, or using social media platforms to raise awareness. Encourage them to use their voice to make a positive impact on their community and society as a whole.
5. Provide accessibility supports: Ensure that polling stations are accessible and provide accommodations for individuals with disabilities, such as audio ballots or Braille voting materials. Offer transportation or accompaniment to the polls for those who need it.
6. Encourage participation in youth leadership programs: Support young people in developing leadership skills, civic engagement, and community involvement through programs like Scouts Canada, Girl Guides of Canada, or other local organizations.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Facilitate opportunities for natural-born Canadian citizens without known genetic conditions to connect with older generations who have lived through different historical events and social changes. This can help bridge gaps in understanding and foster a sense of shared history and community.
8. Create inclusive spaces: Design public spaces that are accessible and welcoming to all,
