Supporting the social inclusion of over 90-year-old teen native English speakers can be challenging due to various factors, including ageism, stereotypes, and societal barriers. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Encourage intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for older teens to interact with younger people, such as mentorship programs or community service projects. This can help break down age-related barriers and foster understanding between generations.
2. Challenge ageist stereotypes: Dispel negative attitudes towards aging by promoting positive representations of older adults in media and culture. Encourage respectful language and behavior towards elders, and challenge ageist jokes or comments when you encounter them.
3. Foster a supportive environment: Create a welcoming atmosphere where older teens feel comfortable and included. Offer opportunities for socialization, such as group outings or club activities, that cater to their interests and abilities.
4. Provide accessibility and accommodations: Ensure that social events and gatherings are accessible and inclusive for older adults with mobility or cognitive challenges. Offer accommodations like seating, transportation, or communication support as needed.
5. Encourage lifelong learning: Support older teens in pursuing their interests and passions by providing access to educational resources, workshops, or mentorship opportunities. This can help them stay engaged and connected with the world around them.
6. Promote age-friendly policies: Advocate for policies that support the well-being of older adults, such as affordable housing, transportation options, and healthcare services. Encourage community leaders to prioritize the needs of this demographic in decision-making processes.
7. Redefine the concept of "teen": Challenge the societal definition of a teenager as someone exclusively between the ages of 13 and 19. Recognize that older adults can also be teenagers, and advocate for their inclusion in youth culture and activities.
8. Create age-mix communities: Foster multigenerational connections by promoting intergenerational living arrangements or community programs. This can help break down age barriers and promote mutual understanding and respect between
