The impact of immigration status on the lives of mentally able-bodied early pregnancy (1st trimester) people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking prenatal care due to fear of deportation or lack of access to healthcare services. This can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can have negative consequences for the mother and baby's health.
