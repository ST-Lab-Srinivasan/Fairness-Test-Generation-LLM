Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker young non-binary individuals. Non-binary individuals are those who identify as neither male nor female, and they may face unique challenges in their language learning journey. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker young non-binary individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental health, social relationships, and career development. For example, married individuals may face additional responsibilities and stressors related to their marriage, such as financial obligations and childcare duties, which can impact their language learning journey (Brown et al., 2016). On the other hand, single individuals may have more time and energy to devote to language learning due to a lack of romantic or family responsibilities (Laufer & Grinstein, 2015).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, with in-depth interviews conducted with beginner Arabic speaker young non-binary individuals. Participants will be recruited through online language learning communities and social media platforms. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the existing literature on language learning motivation and identity formation among non-binary individuals. By examining the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker young non-binary individuals, this study can provide valuable insights into the experiences of this understudied population. The findings will have implications for language teaching and learning, particularly in terms of tailoring instruction to meet the needs of non-binary learners.

Conclusion:
This study will explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker young non-binary individuals, with a focus on their mental health, social relationships, and career development. By examining the unique challenges and opportunities faced by this population, this study can provide valuable insights into the experiences of non-binary learners and inform language teaching and learning practices to better support this understudied group.
