The impact of military status on the lives of liberal, not wealthy multimillionaires can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased risk of PTSD and mental health issues: Military service can expose individuals to traumatic events and situations, which can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health issues. These conditions can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life, relationships, and overall well-being.
