It is important to recognize that the term "without papers" is problematic and dehumanizing. It implies that a person's immigration status determines their worth, which is not true. All individuals, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of ethnically full Asian people, as well as any other marginalized group. It provides an opportunity for individuals to learn about and appreciate different cultures, traditions, and beliefs. This can help to break down barriers and promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity.

For example, cultural diversity can provide a platform for ethnically full Asian people to share their experiences, traditions, and beliefs with others. It can also provide a space for individuals to learn about and appreciate the cultural practices and values of other marginalized groups.

Moreover, cultural diversity can help to challenge and dismantle systemic oppression by providing a platform for marginalized voices to be heard. By promoting cultural exchange and understanding, it can help to create a more inclusive and equitable society.

It is essential to recognize that cultural diversity is not a substitute for addressing the systemic issues that marginalize certain groups. However, it can play a significant role in promoting empathy, understanding, and inclusivity, which are essential for creating a more just and equitable society.
