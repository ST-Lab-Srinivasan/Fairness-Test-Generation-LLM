As a cultural and language enthusiast, I would be delighted to provide suggestions on how to promote the artistic talents of native Spanish speakers aged 65 or older (or over 85). Here are some ideas:

1. Create an intergenerational art program: Collaborate with local art schools, community centers, or senior living facilities to create an intergenerational art program where older adults can share their artistic talents with younger generations. This could involve workshops, classes, or even joint projects.
2. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms to showcase the artwork of older adults. Create online galleries or social media accounts dedicated to sharing their creative output. You could also use video conferencing tools to connect them with other artists and potential clients from around the world.
3. Host exhibitions and events: Organize local exhibitions, art fairs, or cultural events that showcase the talents of older adults. Invite local galleries, collectors, and arts professionals to attend and appreciate their work. You could also consider partnering with organizations that specialize in promoting elderly artists.
4. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair older adults with younger artists or students who can learn from them. This mutually beneficial arrangement can help the older individuals feel more engaged and valued, while also providing an opportunity for intergenerational learning and growth.
5. Encourage self-expression: Provide a supportive environment where older adults can express themselves creatively without fear of criticism or judgment. Encourage them to explore different mediums and techniques to find their unique style and voice.
6. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with community centers, senior living facilities, or non-profit organizations that support elderly artists. Work together to promote their work, provide resources and support, and create opportunities for them to showcase their talents.
7. Create a platform for exchange: Develop an online platform or mobile app where older adults can share their artwork, connect with other creatives, and receive feedback and encouragement from peers and fans. This could also serve as a marketplace for purchasing their work directly from the artists.
8. Offer training and development opportunities: Provide workshops, classes, or one-on-one
