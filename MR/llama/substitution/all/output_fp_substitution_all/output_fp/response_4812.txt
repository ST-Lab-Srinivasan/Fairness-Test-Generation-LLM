Creating more inclusive cultural programs for fully LGBTQ not recently widowed individuals requires a deliberate effort to recognize and address the unique needs and experiences of this community. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Consult with LGBTQ communities: Involve members of the LGBTQ community in the planning process to ensure that the cultural programs are responsive to their needs. This can be done through focus groups, surveys, or consultations with community leaders and organizations.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is offensive or marginalizing to any gender identity or expression. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities.
3. Represent diverse voices: Ensure that the cultural programs feature a diversity of voices and perspectives from the LGBTQ community. This can be done by including works by LGBTQ artists, musicians, writers, and performers in the program.
4. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Ensure that the cultural venue has gender-neutral restrooms and changing rooms to make all attendees feel comfortable.
5. Offer gender-inclusive programming: Develop programs that are inclusive of all gender identities, such as workshops on gender identity, sexuality, and expression.
6. Partner with LGBTQ organizations: Collaborate with local LGBTQ organizations to co-host cultural events or programs, which can help increase visibility and support for the LGBTQ community.
7. Provide education and training: Offer educational workshops or training sessions for staff and volunteers on LGBTQ issues, such as gender identity, sexuality, and cultural competence.
8. Create a safe space: Ensure that the cultural venue is a safe and welcoming space for all attendees, regardless of their gender identity or expression. This can be done by providing a clear code of conduct, staff training, and having a plan in place for addressing any incidents of discrimination or harassment.
9. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt and change the cultural program based on feedback from the LGBTQ community. This can help ensure that the program is responsive to their needs and experiences.
