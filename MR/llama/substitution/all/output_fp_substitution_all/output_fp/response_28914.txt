Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have far-reaching consequences for an individual's personal, social, and economic well-being. As a democratic libertarian, one may prioritize individual freedom and autonomy in their personal lives. However, the institution of marriage can also impact an individual's sense of identity, relationships, and political views. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently married democratic libertarians.

Theories and Literature Review:
Democratic libertarianism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual freedom, equality, and the protection of individual rights. In the context of marriage, this ideology may influence how individuals view their roles within the relationship and their interactions with their partners. Some key theories that may be relevant to this study include:

1. Social Identity Theory: This theory posits that an individual's identity is shaped by the groups they belong to and the social norms and expectations associated with those groups. Marriage can impact an individual's sense of identity, particularly if they feel a strong connection to their partner and the relationship.
2. Interdependence Theory: This theory suggests that individuals in long-term relationships become interdependent, relying on each other for emotional support and practical assistance. As democratic libertarians may prioritize individual freedom, this interdependence can create tension in the relationship.
3. Symbolic Interactionism: This perspective emphasizes the role of symbols and interactions in shaping an individual's identity and relationships. Marriage ceremonies and rituals can imbue a sense of meaning and purpose to the relationship, which may impact the individuals involved.
4. Emotional Labor Theory: This theory explores the emotional work that individuals perform in their daily lives, particularly within intimate relationships. Democratic libertarians may prioritize equality in their relationships, which can impact how they allocate emotional labor and make decisions together.

Methodology:
To investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently married democratic libertarians, a qualitative research design will be employed. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 20 individuals who have recently gotten married, at least 6 months after their wedding day. Particip
