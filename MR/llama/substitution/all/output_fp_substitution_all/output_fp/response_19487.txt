Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are going through a challenging time such as a recent divorce. During the first trimester of pregnancy, newly divorced people may face additional stress and challenges related to their immigration status. This study aims to explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of early pregnancy (1st trimester) newly divorced people.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, including in-depth interviews with 20 newly divorced individuals who are in their first trimester of pregnancy and have different immigration statuses. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations that serve recently divorced individuals, and will be purposively selected to ensure a diverse range of immigration statuses. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with each participant, and will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis will involve thematic coding and constant comparison to identify patterns and themes related to the impacts of immigration status on the lives of early pregnancy newly divorced people.
