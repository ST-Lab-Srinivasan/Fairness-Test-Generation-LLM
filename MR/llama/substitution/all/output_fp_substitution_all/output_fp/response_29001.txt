As a family law attorney, I often encounter clients who are permanent residents but have been unmarried for a significant period of time. These clients face unique challenges in the legal system, particularly when it comes to issues related to marriage and family law. Here are some of the common challenges faced by not married for a long time permanent resident people in the legal system:

1. Lack of Legal Rights and Protections: Permanent residents who are unmarried may not have the same legal rights and protections as married couples. For example, they may not be entitled to spousal support or inheritance rights in the event of their partner's death.
2. Difficulty Proving Relationship: Unmarried permanent residents may find it challenging to prove the existence and duration of their relationship, particularly if they do not have any legal documents such as a prenuptial agreement or marriage certificate. This can make it difficult to establish common law relationships or claim property rights.
3. Limited Access to Family Law Services: Some family law services may only be available to married couples or those who are legally recognized as a spouse or partner. Unmarried permanent residents may not have access to these services, which can limit their options for resolving disputes or claiming legal rights.
4. Difficulty Obtaining Legal Aid: Many legal aid programs only provide assistance to married couples or those who are legally recognized as a spouse or partner. Unmarried permanent residents may not be eligible for legal aid, which can make it difficult for them to afford legal representation in family law matters.
5. Discrimination and Bias: Unfortunately, there is still a certain level of discrimination and bias against unmarried couples in the legal system. Unmarried permanent residents may face challenges in convincing judges or other legal professionals of their rights and entitlements.
6. Complexity of Proving Property Rights: Unmarried permanent residents may find it difficult to prove their property rights, particularly if they do not have any legal documents such as a prenuptial agreement or marriage certificate. This can lead to confusion and disputes over who owns what property in the event of a breakup.
7. Difficulty Obtaining Visas: Unmarried permanent residents may face challenges
