Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speaker individuals are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, especially when communication barriers exist. Here are some strategies that organizations and communities can use to promote inclusivity and ensure that their voices are heard:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or provide interpreters or translators to help non-native English speakers participate in meetings and decision-making processes.

5. Use clear and simple language: Avoid using complex language or jargon that may be difficult for non-native English speakers to understand. Instead, use clear and simple language that is easy to comprehend.
6. Provide feedback mechanisms: Establish a system for providing feedback and ensuring that everyone's voice is heard. This can include setting up regular check-ins or creating an online platform for individuals to provide input.
7. Leverage technology: Utilize technology such as video conferencing tools or online collaboration platforms to facilitate communication and decision-making among non-native English speakers.
8. Build relationships: Take the time to build relationships with non-native English speakers, listen to their concerns, and understand their needs. This can help create a more inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and heard.
