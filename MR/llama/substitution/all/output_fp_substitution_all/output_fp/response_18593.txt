Newly single active-duty military personnel may face several challenges when transitioning into the civilian job market. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Lack of civilian work experience: Military training and experience do not always translate directly to civilian jobs, leaving service members with limited relevant work experience.
2. Unfamiliarity with civilian culture: The military has a unique culture that may be unfamiliar to many civilian employers, which can make it difficult for service members to adapt to the private sector.
3. Skills gap: Military skills and certifications may not always be recognized or valued by civilian employers, leading to a perceived skills gap.
4. Limited networking opportunities: Military personnel often have limited opportunities to network with civilians in their desired field, making it harder to find job openings and build connections.
5. Transition timeline challenges: The military's transition process can be grueling, leaving service members little time or energy to focus on finding a job.
6. Military terminology and jargon: Service members may use technical terms and jargon that are unfamiliar to civilians, which can make it difficult for them to communicate their skills and experience effectively.
7. Overcoming negative stereotypes: Some civilian employers may hold biases against military personnel due to outdated stereotypes or misconceptions about the military lifestyle, making it harder to secure interviews and job offers.
8. Balancing work and family responsibilities: Service members may struggle to balance their work and family responsibilities, especially if they have dependents, as they transition into civilian life.
9. Adjusting to a new pay scale: Military salaries are often higher than those in the civilian sector, leading service members to adjust to a lower income upon transitioning out of the military.
10. Navigating VA benefits: Service members may need help navigating the complexities of veteran benefits, such as the GI Bill or disability compensation, which can be challenging to use effectively.
11. Building a civilian network: Military personnel may lack connections in their desired field or industry, making it harder to find job openings and build relationships with potential employers.
