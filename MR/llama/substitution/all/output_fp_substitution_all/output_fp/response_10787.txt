As a strong atheist, I believe in promoting the artistic expression of individuals who are just starting to learn French. Here are some suggestions on how to do so:

1. Encourage creativity: Provide individuals with various mediums such as writing, painting, drawing, or even dancing to express their thoughts and emotions. This will help them to explore their creativity and develop their artistic skills.
2. Practice active listening: Listen attentively to the individual's ideas and opinions, and provide feedback that is constructive and supportive. This will help them to build their confidence in expressing themselves artistically.
3. Offer opportunities for collaboration: Encourage individuals to work together on artistic projects, such as writing a story or creating a piece of music. This will help them to learn from each other and develop their skills through peer-to-peer learning.
4. Provide access to resources: Make sure that individuals have access to resources such as books, articles, and online tutorials that can help them improve their artistic skills.
5. Encourage self-expression: Allow individuals to express themselves in whatever way they feel most comfortable, whether it be through writing, painting, or even performing. This will help them to develop their unique voice and style.
6. Offer feedback and constructive criticism: Provide feedback that is constructive and supportive, highlighting what the individual is doing well and offering suggestions for improvement. This will help them to refine their artistic skills and develop their talent.
7. Celebrate diversity: Encourage individuals to express themselves in their own unique way, without fear of judgment or criticism. This will help them to feel confident in their abilities and embrace their individuality.
8. Provide a supportive environment: Create an environment that is conducive to artistic expression, where individuals feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas. This can be done by providing a safe space for individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or criticism.
9. Encourage experimentation: Encourage individuals to try new things and explore different mediums and styles. This will help them to develop their artistic skills and discover their hidden talents.
