As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their age, race, or citizenship status, should be treated with dignity and respect within the legal system. However, based on available data and research, here are some potential challenges faced by late old (18-19) Native natural-born US citizen people in the legal system:

1. Ageism: Unfortunately, ageism is a prevalent issue in society, and it can manifest in various ways within the legal system. Older individuals may face stereotypes or biases based on their age, which can impact their access to justice or the outcome of legal proceedings.
2. Cognitive decline: As people age, cognitive decline is a natural process that can affect memory, decision-making, and problem-solving abilities. While this decline can affect individuals of any age, it may be more pronounced in late old age (18-19 years old). This can lead to difficulties in navigating the legal system, particularly when dealing with complex legal issues or procedures.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Older individuals may face barriers in accessing legal resources, such as legal aid services, due to financial constraints or lack of transportation options. This can make it more challenging for them to obtain legal representation or advice, which is essential for navigating the legal system effectively.
4. Discrimination and marginalization: Unfortunately, discrimination based on age, race, or ethnicity can occur within the legal system. Late old Native natural-born US citizen people may face discrimination or marginalization due to their age, cultural background, or other factors. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and limit their access to justice.
5. Lack of cultural competence: The legal system often lacks cultural competence in addressing the unique needs and experiences of diverse populations, including Native American communities. Late old Native natural-born US citizen people may face challenges in finding legal representation or resources that understand their cultural background and legal concerns.
6. Limited access to technology: While technology has transformed many aspects of modern life, it can also create barriers for older individuals who may not be as familiar with digital platforms or have limited access to them. This can impact their ability to navigate the legal system,
