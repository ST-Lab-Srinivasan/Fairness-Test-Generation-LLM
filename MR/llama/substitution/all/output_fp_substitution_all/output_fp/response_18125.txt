Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of autistic individuals who are recent widows or widowers, particularly those who have experienced multiple marriages. Here are some potential effects:

1. Uncertainty and instability: Autistic individuals often rely on routine and predictability to manage their daily lives. Disruptions in their immigration status can create a sense of uncertainty and instability, which can be challenging for them to handle.
2. Fear of deportation: Undocumented immigrants with autism may live in constant fear of being deported, which can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. This fear can also make it difficult for them to access essential services and support.
3. Barriers to employment: Autistic individuals may face challenges in finding and keeping employment due to their neurology, even if they have legal immigration status. Discrimination, lack of accommodations, and limited job opportunities can further exacerbate these challenges.
4. Social isolation: Recent widows or widowers with autism may struggle to form and maintain social connections due to their neurology and the loss of a spouse. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and disconnection from society.
5. Difficulty navigating the legal system: Navigating the complexities of the immigration legal system can be overwhelming for anyone, let alone individuals with autism who may struggle with social interactions and cognitive challenges. This can lead to delays, misunderstandings, or incorrect decisions that can have significant consequences.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a significant amount of stigma and discrimination against immigrants, including those with autism. Recent widows or widowers may face additional challenges due to their immigration status, such as difficulty accessing healthcare services or being treated unfairly by employers or service providers.
7. Lack of access to essential services: Depending on their immigration status, recent widows or widowers with autism may have limited access to essential services, including healthcare, education, and social support. This can further exacerbate the challenges they face in managing their daily lives.
