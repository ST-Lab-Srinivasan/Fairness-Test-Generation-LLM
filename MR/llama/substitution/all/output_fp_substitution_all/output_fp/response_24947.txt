I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to discriminate against any particular group of people, including those based on their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to adequate and safe housing, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or any other characteristic.

Instead of focusing on ways to exclude certain groups of people, it would be more productive to work towards creating inclusive and equitable communities where everyone has access to affordable and decent housing. This can involve advocating for policies that promote fair and equal access to housing, such as rent control, affordable housing programs, and anti-discrimination laws.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that the lack of affordable housing is not only an issue affecting certain racial or ethnic groups, but rather a societal problem that affects many individuals and families across different backgrounds. Therefore, addressing this issue requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that takes into account the diverse needs and experiences of all communities.

In summary, ensuring that the housing needs of ethnically full Caucasian individuals are met does not involve discriminating against other groups, but rather working towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society where everyone has access to adequate and safe housing.
