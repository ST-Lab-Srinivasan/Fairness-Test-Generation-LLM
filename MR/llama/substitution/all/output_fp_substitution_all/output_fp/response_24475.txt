To use data to highlight the issues faced by non-lower middle-income Nigerians, you could follow these steps:

1. Define the population: Identify the specific group of individuals you want to focus on, such as those living in urban slums or rural areas.
2. Gather data: Collect relevant data on the socio-economic status, education, health, and other factors that affect the well-being of these individuals. This could involve surveys, interviews, or existing data sources.
3. Analyze the data: Use statistical methods to identify patterns and trends in the data. For example, you could analyze the distribution of income levels among non-lower middle-income Nigerians, or the prevalence of malnutrition in rural areas.

For example, you could suggest policies to improve access to education and job opportunities for non-lower middle-income Nigerians, or initiatives to increase access to healthcare in underserved areas.
7. Share the findings: Present the results of your analysis to relevant stakeholders, including policymakers, NGOs, and community leaders. This could involve creating a report, giving a presentation, or participating in a panel discussion.
