The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of mid-50s individuals who are just above the poverty line can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Financial burden: Genetic conditions can result in increased healthcare costs, including medical expenses, prescription medications, and lost income due to time missed from work. For individuals who are already living above the poverty line, these additional financial burdens can be particularly challenging.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Individuals with genetic conditions may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to limited resources, lack of knowledge about their condition, or discrimination based on their genetic information. This can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can worsen the condition's impact on their lives.
3. Social isolation: Genetic conditions can lead to social isolation as individuals may avoid social interactions due to feelings of embarrassment or shame about their condition. This can further exacerbate the emotional burden of living with a genetic condition.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Individuals with genetic conditions may experience stigma and discrimination, particularly in communities where there is a lack of understanding or empathy towards people with genetic conditions. This can lead to feelings of low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety.
