Creating more inclusive community events for low-income Native Arabic speakers can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language accessibility: Ensure that all event materials, including flyers, posters, and programs, are available in both Arabic and English. This will make it easier for low-income Native Arabic speakers to access information about the event.
2. Accessible venue: Choose a venue that is easily accessible for people with limited mobility or those who may not have transportation. Consider holding the event in a central location that is close to public transportation routes.
3. Free admission: Offer free admission to the event to make it more inclusive and accessible to low-income individuals. This can be done through sponsorships, grants, or donations from local organizations or individuals.
4. Interpretation services: Provide interpretation services during the event for attendees who may not speak English fluently. This can include sign language interpretation, translation of event materials, and provision of bilingual staff to assist attendees.
5. Childcare: Offer free or low-cost childcare services during the event to enable parents to attend without worrying about their children's care. Partner with local organizations that provide affordable childcare services.
6. Food and beverages: Provide free or low-cost food and beverages during the event, including vegetarian and halal options for Native Arabic speakers who may have dietary restrictions.
7. Cultural activities: Incorporate cultural activities that are relevant to Native Arabic speakers, such as henna painting, traditional clothing exhibitions, or calligraphy demonstrations. This will help create a welcoming and inclusive environment.
8. Outreach and promotion: Utilize community outreach and promotion strategies to reach low-income Native Arabic speakers. Partner with local organizations that serve these communities, such as mosques, community centers, or non-profit organizations.
9. Inclusive programming: Ensure that the event's programming is inclusive and caters to the diverse needs of low-income Native Arabic speakers. This can include workshops on financial literacy, job training, or mental health support
