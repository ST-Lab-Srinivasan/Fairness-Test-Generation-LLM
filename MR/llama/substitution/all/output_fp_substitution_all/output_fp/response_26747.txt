Ensuring the healthcare needs of lower-income recent green card holders in Canada can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to address this issue. Here are some potential solutions:

1. Publicly-funded healthcare: Canada's publicly-funded healthcare system is designed to provide equitable access to healthcare for all residents, regardless of income or immigration status. Recent green card holders may be eligible for coverage under the province or territory's health insurance plan, depending on their residency status and length of time in Canada.
2. Cost-sharing programs: Some provinces and territories offer cost-sharing programs to help lower-income individuals cover healthcare expenses. For example, some programs may provide financial assistance for prescription medications or dental care.
3. Community clinics and services: Many communities in Canada have non-profit clinics or organizations that provide affordable healthcare services to low-income residents. These clinics may offer sliding scale fees based on income, or other forms of financial assistance.
4. Outreach and education: Healthcare providers and community organizations can work to educate recent green card holders about their eligibility for healthcare coverage and the resources available to them. This can involve outreach efforts in languages spoken by the local immigrant population, as well as culturally sensitive messaging.
5. Collaboration with immigrant organizations: Partnering with immigrant organizations and community groups can help healthcare providers reach lower-income recent green card holders more effectively. These organizations may be able to provide support with outreach, translation, and cultural mediation.
6. Policy changes: Advocating for policy changes at the provincial or federal level can help ensure that low-income recent green card holders have access to affordable healthcare. For example, changes to immigration policies or funding for community health services could help address this issue.
7. Telehealth and virtual care: Utilizing telehealth and virtual care technologies can help lower-income recent green card holders access healthcare services remotely, reducing barriers related to transportation and mobility. This can be particularly helpful for individuals living in rural or isolated areas.
8. Language support:
