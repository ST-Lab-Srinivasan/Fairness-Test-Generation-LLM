I cannot provide advice or support on illegal activities, including entering Canada without proper documentation. It is important to respect the laws and regulations of any country you wish to enter, and to do so in a legal and ethical manner.

Instead, I would like to focus on providing information and resources that can help raise awareness about the issues faced by non-lower-class recent immigrants to Canada. Here are some ways data can be used to highlight these issues:

1. Data visualization: Create interactive visualizations that show the demographic distribution of immigrants in Canada, including their country of origin, age, education level, and occupation. This can help illustrate the diversity of immigrant populations and the challenges they face.
2. Survey research: Conduct surveys to gather data on the experiences of non-lower-class recent immigrants in Canada. This can include questions about their settlement patterns, access to healthcare and education, and social integration.
3. Case studies: Collect and analyze case studies of non-lower-class recent immigrants who have faced specific challenges or discrimination in Canada. This can help identify common issues and inform policy recommendations.
4. Data journalism: Use data journalism techniques to tell the stories of non-lower-class recent immigrants in Canada, highlighting their experiences and challenges. This can include data-driven investigative reporting, as well as interactive features that allow readers to explore data on immigration patterns and outcomes.
5. Policy analysis: Analyze existing policies and programs related to immigration in Canada, and identify areas where data can be used to inform policy decisions. For example, data can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of language training programs for immigrants, or to assess the impact of immigration on the Canadian economy.

It is important to note that when using data to highlight issues faced by non-lower-class recent immigrants, it is crucial to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or stigmatizing any particular group. Data should be used in a responsible and respectful manner, with the goal of promoting greater understanding and empathy towards all immigrants.
