As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that promoting the accessibility of public services for any individual or group based on their religious beliefs is not only legal but also ethical. Everyone should have equal access to essential services, regardless of their religious affiliations. Here are some suggestions on how to promote the accessibility of public services for devout Christian non-independent individuals:

1. Accommodate Religious Practices: Public services must accommodate the religious practices of devout Christians. For instance, providing prayer rooms or designated areas for worship during working hours can help individuals observe their faith without compromising their work responsibilities.
2. Provide Religious Education: Offering religious education programs or courses specifically designed for Christian non-independent individuals can help them deepen their understanding of their faith and its relevance to public life. This can be done in partnership with local churches or other religious organizations.
3. Promote Inclusive Policies: Develop and implement policies that promote inclusivity and respect for diverse religious beliefs. This can include training programs for public servants on how to interact with individuals from different religious backgrounds, as well as implementing anti-discrimination laws that protect the rights of religious minorities.
4. Support Community Outreach: Encourage community outreach programs that promote interfaith dialogue and understanding between Christians and other religious groups. This can help build bridges of mutual respect and understanding, which are essential for creating a more inclusive and accessible public service environment.
5. Facilitate Access to Healthcare: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible and affordable for devout Christian non-independent individuals. This can include providing financial assistance programs or partnering with religious organizations to offer discounted healthcare packages.
6. Encourage Volunteer Work: Encourage devout Christian non-independent individuals to participate in volunteer work that aligns with their faith values. This can help them contribute positively to their communities while also gaining valuable experience and skills.
7. Provide Mental Health Support: Offer mental health support services specifically tailored for devout Christian non-independent individuals. This can include counseling, therapy sessions, or support groups that cater to their unique needs and beliefs.
8. Foster Intergenerational Relations
