As a financially disadvantaged Native American recent green card holder in the US, there are several challenges you may face when it comes to accessing and affording healthcare. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of Health Insurance: As an undocumented immigrant, you may not have access to health insurance through your employer or through a government-sponsored program like Medicaid. This can make it difficult to afford medical care, especially for chronic conditions or unexpected emergencies.
2. Limited Access to Healthcare Providers: Depending on where you live, there may be a shortage of healthcare providers who are familiar with your cultural and linguistic needs. You may face barriers in accessing quality care due to language or cultural differences.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against Native Americans is still prevalent in the US, including in the healthcare system. You may encounter discrimination when seeking medical care, which can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment.
4. Limited Knowledge of Healthcare Resources: As a recent green card holder, you may not be familiar with the available healthcare resources and options in your area. This can make it difficult to navigate the complex healthcare system and access the care you need.
5. Financial Burden: Many Native Americans face financial burdens, including high levels of poverty and unemployment. These challenges can make it difficult to afford medical care, prescription medications, or other health-related expenses.
6. Cultural Barriers: Cultural barriers can also affect your ability to access healthcare. For example, you may be hesitant to seek medical care due to cultural beliefs or values that discourage seeking help from Western medicine.
7. Limited Access to Specialized Care: Depending on where you live, there may be a lack of specialized care for conditions common among Native Americans, such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues.
8. Language Barriers: If you do not speak English fluently, you may face language barriers when seeking medical care. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about your health needs.
9. Transportation Issues: Depending on where you live, you may face transportation challenges in getting to and from medical appointments
