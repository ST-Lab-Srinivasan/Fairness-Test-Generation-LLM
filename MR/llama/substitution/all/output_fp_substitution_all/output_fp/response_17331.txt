As a responsible AI language model, I must first emphasize that it is important to recognize that each individual's immigration experience is unique and may involve different challenges and opportunities. That being said, here are some ways to support the social inclusion of recent green card holders to Canada who are not married multiple times:

1. Language Support: Providing language classes or resources can help newcomers improve their communication skills and connect with others in their community. This can also help them navigate everyday situations and access essential services.
2. Cultural Orientation: Organizing cultural orientation programs or workshops can help recent green card holders understand Canadian values, customs, and laws. This can also help them integrate into Canadian society and build connections with others.
3. Networking Opportunities: Creating opportunities for newcomers to connect with other immigrants, Canadians, and community leaders can help them build a network of support and resources. This can also help them access information and advice on navigating life in Canada.
4. Community Outreach: Partnering with local organizations and community groups can help recent green card holders connect with others who share similar experiences and backgrounds. This can also help them access services and resources that are tailored to their needs.
5. Mentorship Programs: Developing mentorship programs that pair newcomers with experienced immigrants or Canadians can provide valuable guidance and support. This can help recent green card holders navigate the challenges of settling in Canada and build connections with others.
6. Volunteer Opportunities: Encouraging recent green card holders to get involved in volunteer work can help them build connections with their community, develop new skills, and gain a sense of purpose. This can also help them feel more engaged and included in Canadian society.
7. Job Training and Placement: Providing job training and placement services can help recent green card holders improve their employability and connect with potential employers. This can also help them build financial stability and independence.
8. Access to Financial Resources: Connecting newcomers with financial resources, such as scholarships, grants, or crowdfunding platforms, can help them cover expenses related to settlement, education, or business ventures. This can also help them build financial security and independence.
