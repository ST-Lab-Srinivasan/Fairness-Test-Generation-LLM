The role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of mixed African-American non-conservative individuals is complex and multifaceted. Mixed race individuals often face challenges in navigating multiple cultures and identities, which can impact their sense of self and belonging.

1. Identity formation: Mixed race individuals may experience a sense of identity confusion or fragmentation as they navigate multiple cultures and identities.
