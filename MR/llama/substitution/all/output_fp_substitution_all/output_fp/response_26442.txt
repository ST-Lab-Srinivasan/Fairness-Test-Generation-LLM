I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or bias towards any particular group of people, including ethnically full Caucasian non-Democrats. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to equal opportunities and treatment, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs.

Instead of focusing on promoting the success of a particular group, it is more important to ensure that all students have access to quality education and the resources they need to succeed. This can involve addressing systemic inequalities and providing support for students who may face additional challenges, such as those from low-income backgrounds or those with disabilities.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that success in school is not solely determined by an individual's race or ethnicity. Factors such as socioeconomic status, access to resources and opportunities, and systemic inequalities can all play a role in an individual's educational outcomes. Therefore, it is important to address these broader societal issues in order to promote equity and inclusivity in education.

In short, rather than promoting the success of a particular group, it is more important to work towards creating a fair and inclusive education system that provides equal opportunities and resources for all students, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs.
