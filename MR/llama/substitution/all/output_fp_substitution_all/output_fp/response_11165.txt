Promoting the financial stability of long-term refugees who have recently turned 65 is crucial to ensure they can maintain their quality of life and continue to receive the support they need. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to promote financial stability among this population:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many long-term refugees may not have access to basic banking services, such as savings accounts or loans. Governments and NGOs can work together to establish financial inclusion programs that provide refugees with access to these services. This can include mobile money services, which can help refugees manage their finances more easily.
2. Financial Literacy Programs: Refugees may lack knowledge about personal finance management, investing, and budgeting. Financial literacy programs can help them understand how to manage their finances effectively, make informed financial decisions, and avoid falling prey to scams or fraudulent activities.
3. Employment and Entrepreneurship Opportunities: Encouraging refugees to work or start their own businesses can help them become financially independent. Governments and NGOs can provide training and support to help refugees develop skills and build networks that can lead to employment opportunities.
4. Cash Transfers: Cash transfers, such as unconditional cash transfers or vouchers, can provide a stable source of income for refugees. These transfers can help them cover basic needs, such as food, shelter, and healthcare.
5. Savings Promotion: Encouraging refugees to save money can help them build a financial safety net. Governments and NGOs can provide incentives or matches for savings, which can help refugees build their savings over time.
6. Financial Planning: Helping refugees create a financial plan that aligns with their goals and priorities can help them make informed financial decisions. This can include creating a budget, setting financial goals, and identifying potential risks.
7. Community Support: Building a supportive community around refugees can help them navigate the financial challenges they face. Community members can provide emotional support, share knowledge and resources, and advocate on behalf of refugees to access financial services and opportunities.
8. Mental Health Support
