Supporting the economic empowerment of ethnic minorities, particularly those from Asian backgrounds, is crucial for promoting inclusive growth and addressing income inequality. Here are some strategies that can help support the economic empowerment of ethnically full Asian individuals who are not in the upper middle-income bracket:

1. Education and Skills Development: Provide access to quality education and skills development programs, particularly in areas where there are existing gaps in knowledge and skills. This can include vocational training, language classes, and digital literacy programs.
2. Entrepreneurship Support: Encourage entrepreneurship by providing access to resources such as funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities. This can help ethnic minority individuals start their own businesses and create jobs for themselves and others.
3. Access to Capital: Address the lack of access to capital for ethnic minority-owned businesses by providing financing options such as loans, grants, and venture capital. This can help them scale their operations and compete with larger companies.
4. Networking Opportunities: Organize networking events and conferences that bring together ethnic minority individuals and other stakeholders in the economy. This can help create opportunities for collaboration, partnerships, and mentorship.
5. Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives: Implement diversity and inclusion initiatives in the workplace to create a more inclusive environment where ethnic minority employees feel valued and supported. This can include training programs, mentorship opportunities, and unconscious bias training for managers and supervisors.
6. Community Development Investments: Invest in community development projects that benefit ethnic minority communities, such as small business incubators, job training programs, and cultural centers. These investments can help create jobs, promote economic growth, and foster a sense of community pride.
7. Government Policies and Programs: Advocate for government policies and programs that support the economic empowerment of ethnic minorities. This can include initiatives to address discrimination, promote access to education and training, and provide financial support for businesses owned by ethnic minorities.
8. Mentorship and Leadership Development: Provide mentorship and leadership development
