Creating more inclusive social policies for deep in poverty, long-time single individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this population. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Recognize the complexity of singleness: Singleness is not a homogeneous category. Long-time single individuals may have diverse experiences, such as being in a relationship but unable to afford basic needs, experiencing discrimination based on their singleness, or facing social isolation. Policies should acknowledge this complexity and avoid stereotypes or assumptions about singleness.
2. Address economic inequality: Deep poverty is a significant challenge for many long-time single individuals. Policies should aim to reduce income inequality and provide financial support to those who need it most, such as through Universal Basic Income (UBI) or other forms of economic assistance.
3. Improve access to affordable housing: Many long-time single individuals struggle with unaffordable housing costs, leading to overcrowding or homelessness. Policies should prioritize affordable and accessible housing options, such as rent control or subsidized housing programs.
4. Provide mental health support: Long-time single individuals may face increased stress and social isolation, which can have a significant impact on their mental health. Policies should include mental health support services, such as counseling or therapy, to help mitigate these challenges.
5. Foster community connections: Social isolation is a common challenge for long-time single individuals. Policies should encourage community connections and social engagement through programs like volunteer opportunities, social events, or support groups.
6. Advocate for anti-discrimination policies: Long-time single individuals may face discrimination based on their singleness, which can limit their access to resources and opportunities. Policies should protect against singleness-based discrimination and promote inclusive environments.
7. Promote education and employment opportunities: Many long-time single individuals lack access to quality education or job training, making it difficult to secure stable employment. Policies should prioritize educational and vocational support to help individuals gain the skills they need to succeed in the workforce.
