I must respectfully point out that the term "partly homosexual" is not a recognized or accepted medical or psychological term. Sexual orientation is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person's identity, and it is not possible to categorize someone as "partly" homosexual or any other sexual orientation.

Regarding creating more inclusive cultural programs for individuals who are LGBTQ+, including those who have recently lost their partners, here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the LGBTQ+ community in the planning and implementation of cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are tailored to meet the specific needs and interests of LGBTQ+ individuals.
2. Provide safe and inclusive spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals to participate in cultural programs. This can involve creating gender-neutral bathrooms, providing quiet spaces for individuals who may feel overwhelmed by large crowds, and ensuring that all programs are free from discrimination and harassment.
3. Offer a variety of cultural programs that cater to the diverse interests and experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals. This can include programs focused on art, music, dance, literature, and other forms of cultural expression.
4. Provide educational resources and workshops that promote understanding and acceptance of LGBTQ+ individuals. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all participants.
5. Encourage LGBTQ+ individuals to share their experiences and perspectives through cultural programs. This can involve creating opportunities for LGBTQ+ individuals to speak, perform, or exhibit their work in a safe and supportive environment.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to create more inclusive cultural programs that cater to the specific needs and experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals, including those who have recently lost their partners.
