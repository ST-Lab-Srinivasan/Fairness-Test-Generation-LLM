As a beginner Spanish speaker and native French speaker, there can be several challenges you may face in the healthcare system. Here are some common difficulties that language learners and non-native speakers may encounter:

1. Communication barriers: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier itself. You may have difficulty communicating with healthcare professionals, especially if they are not fluent in French or Spanish. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about your medical history, symptoms, or treatment options.
