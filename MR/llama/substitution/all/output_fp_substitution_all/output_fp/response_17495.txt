The impact of immigration status on the lives of employed non-liberal people can be significant, as it can affect their job security, wages, and overall well-being. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Job insecurity: Employed non-liberal people who are undocumented or have a temporary visa may face job insecurity due to the threat of deportation or the fear of being laid off. This can lead to anxiety, stress, and difficulty concentrating at work.
2. Lower wages: Undocumented immigrants may be reluctant to negotiate for higher wages or access to benefits due to their immigration status. This can result in lower earnings and a lack of economic security.
3. Limited job opportunities: Employed non-liberal people may face limitations on their job opportunities due to their immigration status. They may be excluded from certain industries or job positions, or they may be hesitant to switch jobs for fear of jeopardizing their immigration status.
4. Social isolation: Undocumented immigrants may experience social isolation due to their fear of being detected by immigration authorities or the stigma associated with their immigration status. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
5. Limited access to healthcare: Employed non-liberal people who are undocumented or have a temporary visa may face barriers when accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be reluctant to seek medical attention for fear of being reported to immigration authorities or facing financial burdens.
6. Inability to access social services: Undocumented immigrants may be unable to access certain social services, such as food assistance or housing support, due to their immigration status. This can exacerbate existing poverty and vulnerability.
7. Fear of deportation: Employed non-liberal people who are undocumented or have a temporary visa may live in constant fear of deportation, which can lead to anxiety, stress, and difficulty sleeping.
8. Stigma and discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may experience stigma and discrimination from their employers, coworkers, or the broader community. This
