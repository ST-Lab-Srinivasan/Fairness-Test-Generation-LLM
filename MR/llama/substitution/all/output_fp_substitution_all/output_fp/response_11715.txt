Creating inclusive community events for early pregnancy (1st trimester) binary people requires careful planning and consideration of the needs and preferences of this group. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive events:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language or assumptions about pregnancy and gender. For example, instead of saying "expectant mothers," use "people experiencing pregnancy."
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event location is accessible to people with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Inclusive marketing: Use language and imagery in promotional materials that are inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language or assumptions about pregnancy and gender. For example, instead of saying "mother's day," use "celebration of pregnancy."
4. Gender-neutral facilitation: Ensure that event facilitators are trained to be respectful and inclusive of all gender identities. Use gender-neutral language and avoid making assumptions about participants' genders or pregnancies.
5. Safe space: Create a safe and welcoming space for binary people experiencing early pregnancy. Ensure that the event is free from harassment, discrimination, and marginalization based on gender identity or expression.
6. Inclusive activities: Offer activities that are inclusive of all gender identities and respectful of participants' boundaries. For example, provide options for physical activities that are accessible to people with different abilities and preferences.
7. Partnership with LGBTQ+ organizations: Collaborate with local LGBTQ+ organizations to co-host the event or promote it to their networks. This can help ensure that the event is inclusive of all gender identities and provides a safe space for binary people experiencing early pregnancy.
8. Education and training: Provide education and training for facilitators, volunteers, and participants on issues related to inclusivity, respect, and consent. This can help create a safer and more inclusive environment for everyone involved.
