Ensuring the educational needs of infant gender-fluid students from lower-middle-income families can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to support these students. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a safe and inclusive learning environment: Educators should strive to create a classroom environment that is welcoming and inclusive of all gender identities. This can involve using gender-neutral language, avoiding binary gender assignments, and encouraging students to express themselves freely.
2. Provide gender-sensitive education: Teachers can incorporate lessons on gender identity, expression, and stereotypes into their curriculum. This can help students understand and respect the gender diversity of their peers and the broader community.
3. Offer gender-affirming resources: Schools can provide gender-affirming resources such as books, films, and workshops that promote positive representations of gender diversity. These resources can help students develop empathy and understanding towards gender-diverse individuals.
