As a beginner French speaker, a native natural-born US citizen may face several challenges when navigating the French legal system. Here are some of the common difficulties that may arise:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge faced by beginner French speakers is the language barrier. While many legal terms and concepts may be familiar, the nuances of the French language can make it difficult to fully understand and communicate effectively in a legal context.
2. Cultural differences: French culture and values are different from those in the US, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications in legal settings. For example, the concept of "laisser faire" (let things be) is highly valued in France, which may be at odds with the more proactive approach to problem-solving in the US legal system.
3. Unfamiliarity with legal terminology and concepts: French law has its own unique terminology and concepts, which can be unfamiliar to beginner French speakers. This can make it difficult to understand and navigate the legal system, particularly when dealing with complex legal issues.
4. Different legal frameworks: The French legal system is based on civil law, while the US legal system is based on common law. This means that there are significant differences in how laws are organized, interpreted, and applied in each country.
5. Limited resources: As a beginner French speaker, it may be challenging to access the necessary resources and support to navigate the French legal system effectively. For example, it may be difficult to find English-speaking lawyers or interpreters who are familiar with both the French and US legal systems.
6. Different judicial processes: The judicial processes in France and the US can also be different, which can cause confusion for beginner French speakers. For instance, the use of expert witnesses and the role of judges may be different in each country.
7. Time constraints: In France, legal proceedings can take longer than in the US, which can be challenging for beginner French speakers who are not used to the slower pace of justice in France.
8. Different standards of proof: The standard of proof required in French courts is higher than in US courts, which can make it more difficult for beginner French speakers to prove their case.
9. Limited access to legal aid: In France, there are limited resources available
