Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly single Native Arabic speaker individuals. It is important to understand how cultural heritage influences identity formation, particularly during times of change and transition, such as when an individual becomes newly single. This study aims to explore the relationship between cultural heritage and identity formation among newly single Native Arabic speakers.

Theory:
Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society. It is transmitted through socialization and cultural institutions, such as language, religion, and education. Identity, on the other hand, is the concept of an individual's sense of self, which is shaped by their experiences, interactions, and relationships with others.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews to collect data from 20 newly single Native Arabic speakers. Participants will be recruited through purposive sampling, ensuring diversity in terms of age, gender, and geographic location. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for a detailed analysis of participants' experiences and perceptions.

Results:
The findings indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly single Native Arabic speakers. Participants reported feeling a strong connection to their cultural heritage, which influenced their sense of self and identity. For example, one participant stated, "My culture is a big part of who I am. It's where I come from, it's how I was raised, it's my beliefs and values."

Conclusion:
This study highlights the importance of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of newly single Native Arabic speakers. Findings suggest that participants' connections to their cultural heritage were a significant factor in their sense of self and identity. These results have implications for interventions aimed at promoting mental health and well-being among newly single individuals, particularly those from culturally diverse backgrounds.

Recommendations:
Healthcare providers and mental health professionals should take into account the cultural heritage of their patients when providing support and treatment. This may involve incorporating cultural practices and beliefs
