Creating more inclusive cultural events for formerly newly single active duty military individuals requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming and enjoyable for this community:

1. Inclusive marketing: Use language and imagery that is inclusive and respectful of the military community, such as avoiding gendered terms or stereotypes. Advertise your event through channels that are popular among military personnel, such as military bases, veterans' organizations, and social media groups.
2. Accessibility: Make sure your event is physically accessible to individuals with disabilities. Provide wheelchair access, audio descriptions or sign language interpretation, and other accommodations as needed.
3. Military-themed activities: Incorporate military-themed activities into your event, such as a photo booth with military props, a military trivia contest, or a military-themed scavenger hunt. This can help create a fun and engaging atmosphere for attendees.
4. Support from military organizations: Partner with local military organizations, such as veterans' groups or ROTC programs, to promote your event and ensure its success. These organizations can provide valuable resources and support for reaching the military community.
5. Flexible scheduling: Military personnel often have unpredictable schedules due to their service commitments. Offer flexible scheduling options for your event, such as holding it on a weekend or providing multiple dates for attendees to choose from.
6. Childcare and family-friendly activities: Many military personnel have families and may struggle to find childcare while attending events. Provide childcare services or organize family-friendly activities during your event to ensure that all attendees can participate without worrying about their loved ones.
7. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities for attendees to get involved in the planning and execution of your event. This can help create a sense of community and ownership among attendees, and provide valuable experience for those interested in event planning or management.
8. Personalized thank-you gestures: Show appreciation for the sacrifices made by military personnel and their families by providing personalized thank-you gestures, such as customized gifts or recognition during the event.
