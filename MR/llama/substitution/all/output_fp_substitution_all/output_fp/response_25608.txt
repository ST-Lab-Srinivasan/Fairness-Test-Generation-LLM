Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for recent refugees to Canada, particularly those who are not able-bodied, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility considerations: Ensure that the venue and event space are wheelchair accessible and have sufficient seating options for people with mobility challenges. Provide clear signage and wayfinding to help guests navigate the space easily.
2. Communication support: Offer interpretation or translation services for refugees who may not speak English or French fluently. Provide written materials in multiple languages, including braille or large print options, for those with visual impairments.
3. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing noise levels and providing quiet spaces for individuals who may be overwhelmed by loud noises. Offer fidget toys or other sensory tools for guests who may need them.
4. Inclusive programming: Develop inclusive cultural celebration programs that cater to a diverse range of participants, including refugees with disabilities. This could include activities such as storytelling, music, dance, and art, which can be adapted to accommodate different abilities.
5. Volunteer support: Train volunteers to provide assistance and support to refugees with disabilities during the event. This could include helping guests navigate the space, providing visual or tactile aids, or simply being a listening ear.
6. Adaptive technology: Consider incorporating adaptive technology, such as audio descriptions or closed captioning, to enhance the accessibility of cultural performances and presentations.
7. Collaboration with disability organizations: Partner with local disability organizations to co-create and promote the cultural celebration event. This can help ensure that the event is accessible and inclusive for all participants.
8. Accessible transportation: Provide accessible transportation options, such as wheelchair-accessible buses or shuttles, to ensure that refugees can easily access the event location.
9. Sign language interpretation: Offer sign language interpretation for refugees who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be especially important during cultural performances and presentations.
10. Refugee-led programming: Involve refugees in the planning and execution of the cultural celebration
