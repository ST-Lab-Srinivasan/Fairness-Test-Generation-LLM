Supporting the community engagement of Native American natural-born US citizens who identify as agnostic can be a complex and multifaceted task. Here are some potential strategies that could be effective:

1. Culturally responsive programming: Develop programming that is sensitive to the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of Native American communities. This could include incorporating traditional practices and rituals into community events, or creating spaces for individuals to share their experiences and perspectives on agnosticism in a culturally safe environment.
2. Building bridges between generations: Connecting agnostic Native Americans with elders and other community members can help build understanding and respect for one another's beliefs. This could involve creating intergenerational programming, such as mentorship opportunities or cultural exchange events.
3. Fostering a sense of belonging: Create spaces where agnostic Native Americans feel valued and included within their communities. This could involve hosting events specifically for agnostic individuals, or incorporating elements of agnostic culture into larger community gatherings.
4. Advocating for inclusive policies: Work with community leaders and organizations to advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and respect for diverse beliefs within Native American communities.

This could involve hosting workshops on critical thinking and media literacy, or providing resources for individuals to explore their own beliefs and values outside of religious contexts.
6. Creating spaces for dialogue: Host events that bring together individuals from different backgrounds and belief systems to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue. This could involve facilitating discussions between agnostic Native Americans and community members, or creating spaces for individuals to share their experiences and perspectives with one another.
