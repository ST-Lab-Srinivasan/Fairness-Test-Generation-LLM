Creating more inclusive public policies for active-duty non-citizen individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and vulnerabilities. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the challenges faced by non-citizens in the military: Non-citizens in the military face unique challenges, including language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination. Policymakers must acknowledge these challenges and work to address them.
2. Provide legal protections: Ensure that non-citizens in the military have equal access to legal protections and benefits as their U.S. citizen counterparts. This may include providing legal representation, protecting their rights under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and ensuring they are not discriminated against based on their immigration status.
3. Address language barriers: Provide language training and interpretation services to ensure that non-citizens in the military can communicate effectively with their superiors, peers, and families. This may include providing language classes, interpreters, and translators.
4. Promote cultural awareness: Educate military leaders and personnel on the cultural norms and practices of diverse groups, including non-citizens. This may involve training programs that address cultural competency and promote understanding and respect for different backgrounds and beliefs.
5. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance to non-citizens in the military who face economic challenges, such as providing low-interest loans or grants for education and housing. This may also involve addressing issues related to access to healthcare, childcare, and other essential services.
6. Advocate for immigration reform: Work with lawmakers to advocate for immigration reform that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by non-citizens in the military. This may include providing a pathway to citizenship for those who serve honorably in the military.
7. Address social isolation: Provide support services to help non-citizens in the military connect with their peers and build social networks. This may involve organizing social events, providing mentorship programs, or creating online communities.
8. Promote diversity and inclusion: Foster a culture of diversity and inclusion within the military by
