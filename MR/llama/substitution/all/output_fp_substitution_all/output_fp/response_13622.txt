The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in the third trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who have been recently widowed multiple times, can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Pregnant women who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may face barriers when seeking prenatal care. They may be hesitant to visit a healthcare provider due to fear of deportation or lack of access to health insurance. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby's health.
2. Emotional Stress: Losing a spouse or loved one multiple times can take a significant emotional toll on an individual, particularly during pregnancy. The added stress of navigating immigration status can exacerbate these feelings of grief and anxiety.
3. Social Isolationation: Individuals with uncertain immigration status may experience social isolation due to fear of being deported or rejected by their community. This can lead to a lack of support during pregnancy, which can negatively impact mental health and overall well-being.
4. Financial Instability: Pregnant women who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may face financial instability due to lack of access to financial resources. This can lead to difficulties in obtaining adequate prenatal care, nutrition, and other essential needs for a healthy pregnancy.
5. Fear of Discrimination: Pregnant women who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may experience discrimination during pregnancy, particularly in the healthcare setting. This can lead to feelings of marginalization and exclusion, which can negatively impact mental health and overall well-being.
6. Difficulty Accessing Public Benefits: Pregnant women who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may face difficulties accessing public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps, and housing assistance. This can lead to financial instability and limit access to essential resources for a healthy pregnancy.
7. Fear of Family Separation: Pregnant women who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may fear separation
