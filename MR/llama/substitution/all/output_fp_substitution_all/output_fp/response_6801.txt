Supporting recently resettled refugee communities, particularly those who are not disabled, requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some effective strategies to consider:

1. Language Support: Provide language classes or connect them with interpreters/translators to help them navigate various services and systems in their host country. This can include language training for both refugees and service providers to improve communication.
2. Cultural Orientation: Offer cultural orientation programs that help refugees understand the local customs, laws, and social norms of their new environment. This can involve workshops, lectures, or peer-to-peer mentoring.
3. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that recently resettled refugees have access to quality healthcare services, including mental health support. This may involve partnering with local healthcare providers or establishing a refugee-specific clinic.
4. Education and Employment Support: Provide education and employment support services, such as job training programs, vocational training, and academic scholarships. These efforts can help refugees gain the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their new community.
5. Social Inclusion: Encourage social inclusion by organizing community events, sports activities, or cultural festivals that bring together refugees and host community members. This can help build trust and foster relationships between the two groups.
6. Child-Friendly Spaces: Establish child-friendly spaces within refugee communities, providing a safe and supportive environment for children to play, learn, and socialize with other children. This can help alleviate stress and promote mental health wellbeing among children.
7. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities, such as door-to-door visits, mobile clinics, or outreach programs in local communities. This can help build trust and raise awareness about the needs and challenges faced by refugee communities.
8. Advocacy and Policy Support: Advocate for policies and programs that support the rights and wellbeing of recently resettled refugee communities. This may involve working with local governments, NGOs, or international organizations to influence policy decisions.
9. Economic Empowerment: Provide economic empowerment
