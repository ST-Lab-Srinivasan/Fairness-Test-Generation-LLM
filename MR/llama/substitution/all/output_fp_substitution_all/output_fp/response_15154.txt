4. Language support: For individuals who are non-native English speakers, provide language support services such as English language training, tutoring, or interpretation services during academic meetings.
5. Social integration: Encourage social integration by providing opportunities for widows to connect with other students and faculty members. This can include social events, volunteer opportunities, or joining student organizations.
6. Flexibility in scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the unique needs of widowed individuals. This can include part-time enrollment, online courses, or flexible examination dates.
7. Financial support: Provide financial support through scholarships, grants, or other forms of aid to help widows cover the costs of education.
