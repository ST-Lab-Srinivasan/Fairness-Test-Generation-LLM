The promotion of inclusion of ethnically full African-American long-time civilians in casual athletes can be achieved through several strategies:

1. Outreach and Education: Reach out to the local community, particularly in areas with a high concentration of African-American population, and provide educational workshops on the benefits of participating in sports and physical activities. Emphasize the importance of inclusivity and diversity in casual athletes.
2. Scholarships and Financial Assistance: Offer scholarships or financial assistance to individuals who face economic barriers to participating in sports and physical activities. This can help remove financial impediments that might hinder their participation.
3. Creating Inclusive Environments: Ensure that recreational spaces and facilities are inclusive and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Provide training to coaches and staff on how to create an inclusive environment and address any incidents of discrimination or bias.

8. Encouraging Diversity in Coaching Roles: Ensure that coaching staff is diverse and representative of the community being served. This can help create a more inclusive environment and provide role models for individuals from underrepresented groups.
