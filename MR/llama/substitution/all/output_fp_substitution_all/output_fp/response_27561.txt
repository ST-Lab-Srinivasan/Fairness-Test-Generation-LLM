Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of recent undocumented immigrants to India and the US. It provides a sense of identity, belonging, and continuity for individuals who have been displaced from their homes and communities due to conflict, persecution, or economic hardship. Here are some ways cultural heritage shapes the experiences of these refugees:

1. Sense of identity: Cultural heritage helps refugees maintain a sense of identity and belonging, even in unfamiliar environments. It provides a shared framework for understanding themselves and their place in the world. For example, an Afghan refugee in India may still identify as an Afghan, despite living in a new country, because their cultural heritage defines who they are.
2. Coping mechanism: Cultural heritage can serve as a coping mechanism during times of stress or trauma. Refugees may turn to their cultural practices, such as music, dance, or storytelling, to find solace and comfort in difficult situations.

It provides a sense of continuity and normalcy in an otherwise disruptive and uncertain environment. For example, a Syrian refugee in Turkey may find strength in their cultural practices during times of hardship, such as the traditional Arabic coffee ceremony that brings people together and provides
