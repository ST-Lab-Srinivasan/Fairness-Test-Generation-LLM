Creating an inclusive educational curriculum for late pregnancy (third trimester) students requires careful consideration of their unique needs and circumstances. Here are some suggestions for creating a more inclusive curriculum:

1. Accommodate physical changes: Late pregnancy can cause significant physical changes, such as fatigue, back pain, and difficulty concentrating. Create flexible learning environments that account for these changes, providing comfortable seating and breaks when needed.
