This could be done by providing a private area for attendees to share their thoughts and feelings or by offering a confidentiality agreement for those who wish to participate in group activities.
4. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials and resources that are tailored to the specific needs of long-time divorced carriers of genetic conditions. This could include information on managing symptoms, coping strategies, and legal rights.
5. Encourage peer support: Arrange for attendees to connect with each other through group activities or one-on-one mentorship opportunities. This can help build a sense of community and support among attendees.
