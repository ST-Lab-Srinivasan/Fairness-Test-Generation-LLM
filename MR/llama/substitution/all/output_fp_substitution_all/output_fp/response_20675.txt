Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, who have recently gone through a divorce or other major life change, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space for sharing: Establish a comfortable and non-judgmental environment where these individuals feel free to express their thoughts and feelings. This could be through regular meetings or workshops, or even online communities.
2. Use accessible language: When communicating with beginner Chinese speakers, use simple language and avoid technical jargon that may be difficult for them to understand. Be patient and provide explanations when needed.
3. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage all members to participate in decision-making processes, regardless of their level of proficiency in Chinese. Use visual aids, such as pictures or videos, to help illustrate ideas and make them more accessible.
4. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources to help beginner Chinese speakers improve their communication skills. This could include one-on-one tutoring or group classes.

6. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms, such as online forums or messaging groups, to engage with beginner Chinese speakers and provide a platform for them to share their thoughts and ideas.
7. Build relationships: Take the time to build personal relationships with beginner Chinese speakers. Get to know them as individuals and show genuine interest in their experiences and perspectives.
8. Provide mentorship: Pair beginner Chinese speakers with more experienced members of the community who can provide guidance and support in navigating decision-making processes.
9. Encourage self-advocacy: Teach beginner Chinese speakers how to advocate for themselves and express their opinions confidently. Provide them with tools and resources to help them navigate difficult situations.
