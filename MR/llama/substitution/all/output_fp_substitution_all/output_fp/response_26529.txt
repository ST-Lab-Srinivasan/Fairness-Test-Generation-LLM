To ensure that the voices of beginner French speakers (i.e., non-native speakers who are learning the language) and lifelong widowed individuals are heard in decision-making processes, consider the following strategies:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Design meetings and decision-making processes that are accessible and welcoming to all, regardless of their level of French proficiency or marital status. Use plain language and avoid jargon to make sure everyone can understand the discussions.
