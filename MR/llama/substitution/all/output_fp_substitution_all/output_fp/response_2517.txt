Delayed or missed medical interventions: Women who are unable to access healthcare during the third trimester may miss out on important medical interventions, such as regular check-ups, ultrasounds, and blood tests. This can lead to delayed detection of potential complications, which can have serious consequences for the mother and baby.
3. Inadequate pain management: Pregnancy can cause significant discomfort and pain, especially during the third trimester. Women who are unable to access adequate pain management may struggle to manage their symptoms, leading to a decreased quality of life.
