Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of financially disadvantaged individuals in their late 30s. Here are some potential consequences:

1. Increased healthcare costs: Individuals with genetic conditions may require frequent medical appointments, tests, and treatments, which can be costly. They may also face higher premiums for health insurance due to their pre-existing condition.
2. Limited employment opportunities: Genetic conditions can make it difficult for individuals to find or maintain employment, particularly if their condition affects their ability to perform certain tasks or functions. This can lead to a decrease in income and financial stability.
3. Social isolation: Individuals with genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to stigma or discrimination associated with their condition. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety, which can further impact their mental health and well-being.
4. Reduced quality of life: Genetic conditions can significantly reduce an individual's quality of life, particularly if they experience chronic pain, fatigue, or other symptoms that affect their ability to enjoy activities and experiences.
5. Financial burden on family members: In some cases, genetic conditions may place a financial burden on family members who may need to provide support for medical expenses, lost income, or other costs associated with caring for a loved one.
6. Impact on mental health: Living with a genetic condition can have a significant impact on an individual's mental health, particularly if they experience feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, or stigma associated with their condition.
7. Limited access to education and training: Individuals with genetic conditions may face barriers to accessing education and training opportunities due to their condition, which can limit their ability to advance in their careers or improve their financial situation.
8. Difficulty finding affordable housing: Individuals with genetic conditions may face challenges finding affordable and accessible housing options, particularly if they require specific accommodations due to their condition.
9. Limited access to transportation: Depending on the nature of their condition, individuals with genetic conditions may face barriers to accessing transportation, which can limit their ability to travel for medical appointments or other purposes.
