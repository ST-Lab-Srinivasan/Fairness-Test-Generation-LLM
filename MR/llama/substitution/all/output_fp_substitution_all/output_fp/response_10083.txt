As a native Arabic speaker and healthcare professional, I have observed several challenges that native Arabic speaker teenagers and young adults face in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barriers: Many native Arabic speakers may not be fluent in English or other languages used in healthcare settings, which can create communication barriers and hinder the ability to understand medical instructions or ask questions about their care.
2. Cultural differences: The cultural background and values of native Arabic speakers may differ from those of the healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications. For example, some Arab cultures place a strong emphasis on family and community involvement in medical decision-making, which may not be aligned with the more individualistic approach used in Western healthcare systems.
3. Stereotyping and discrimination: Unfortunately, native Arabic speakers may face stereotyping and discrimination in the healthcare system, which can lead to a lack of trust or hesitation to seek medical care. This can be due to negative attitudes towards their cultural background or language differences.
4. Limited access to healthcare services: In some areas with limited resources, native Arabic speakers may face challenges accessing healthcare services, such as lack of availability of interpreters or translators, or limited knowledge of local healthcare systems among community members.
5. Differences in medical knowledge and practices: There may be differences in medical knowledge and practices between native Arabic speakers and healthcare providers, which can lead to miscommunications or misunderstandings. For example, some Arab cultures may have different beliefs or practices regarding certain medical procedures or treatments.
6. Lack of representation: Native Arabic speakers may feel underrepresented or ignored in the healthcare system, leading to a lack of trust or engagement with the healthcare providers. This can be due to a lack of cultural sensitivity or understanding among healthcare providers.
7. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Native Arabic speakers may face challenges navigating the complex healthcare system, particularly if they are not fluent in the local language. This can lead to difficulties accessing care, understanding medical instructions, or advocating for their own needs.
