Supporting the social inclusion of over 90-year-old teen beginner Arabic speakers can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Provide language classes tailored to their needs: Offer language classes specifically designed for older beginners, taking into account their learning styles and pace. This will help them feel more comfortable and confident in their ability to learn the language.
2. Use technology to facilitate communication: Utilize video conferencing tools, messaging apps, or other digital platforms that can help them connect with others who share their interests. This can also help bridge any geographical gaps.
3. Organize social events: Plan social events specifically for older beginners, such as potlucks, game nights, or movie nights. These events can provide opportunities for them to interact with others in a relaxed setting.
4. Create a mentorship program: Pair them with more experienced Arabic speakers who can offer guidance and support. This can help build their confidence and improve their language skills.
5. Foster a sense of community: Encourage older beginners to connect with each other through online forums, Facebook groups, or other digital platforms. This can help create a sense of belonging and community, which is essential for social inclusion.
6. Provide cultural immersion experiences: Organize cultural events or trips that allow them to immerse themselves in Arabic culture. This can help them develop a deeper appreciation for the language and its rich history and customs.
7. Offer one-on-one tutoring: For those who prefer more individualized attention, offer one-on-one tutoring sessions with experienced Arabic teachers. This can help them improve their language skills at their own pace.
8. Create a safe space for practice: Designate a specific area or time each week where they can practice speaking Arabic without fear of judgment or criticism. This can help build their confidence and improve their language skills.
9. Celebrate milestones: Acknowledge and celebrate their progress and achievements, no matter how small. This can help boost their motivation and sense of accomplishment.
10. Be patient and supportive: Most importantly, be patient and supportive throughout the learning process. Enc
