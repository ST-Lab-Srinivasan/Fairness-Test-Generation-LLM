The impacts of military status on the lives of non-libertarian, non-upper-class individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited job opportunities: Military service members often face challenges when transitioning back to civilian life due to their military status. They may struggle to find employment that aligns with their skills and experience, as many civilian employers view military training and experience as being irrelevant or too specialized.
