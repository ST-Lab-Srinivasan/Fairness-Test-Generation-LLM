Ensuring the healthcare needs of deaf individuals over the age of 90 are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique communication and accessibility challenges. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Accessible Communication: Provide qualified sign language interpreters or real-time captioners for all medical appointments, procedures, and tests. This ensures that deaf patients can fully understand their diagnosis, treatment options, and follow-up instructions.
2. Training for Healthcare Professionals: Offer workshops and training sessions for healthcare providers on how to communicate with deaf patients, including sign language interpretation and the use of technology such as text messaging or video remote interpreting (VRI).
3. Use of Technology: Leverage technology to improve communication and accessibility, such as VRI, which allows for real-time communication between healthcare providers and deaf patients remotely. Mobile apps and other digital tools can also facilitate communication and appointment scheduling.

Accessibility Modifications: Make physical modifications to healthcare facilities to improve accessibility for deaf patients, such as installing visual alert systems, providing tactile markings on floors and walls, and ensuring that examination rooms are equipped with appropriate technology (e.g., loop systems for hearing aids).
8. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and education efforts to raise awareness about the healthcare needs of deaf individuals over 90 years old. This can involve partnering with local
