Low-income individuals in the third trimester of pregnancy may face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Lower-class individuals may struggle to afford proper prenatal care, which can lead to complications during pregnancy and childbirth. This can result in a higher risk of birth defects, premature birth, or other complications that may require costly medical interventions.
2. Lack of transportation: In rural or underserved areas, lower-class individuals may have limited access to reliable transportation, making it difficult to get to prenatal appointments or emergency services during labor and delivery.
3. Limited financial resources: Lower-class individuals may struggle to afford basic necessities, such as food, clothing, and housing, which can impact their overall health and well-being during pregnancy. This can also limit their ability to pay for medical care or other expenses related to pregnancy and childbirth.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on socioeconomic status is still prevalent in many parts of the world. Lower-class individuals may face bias from healthcare providers, which can result in inadequate care or delayed diagnosis of complications.
5. Lack of access to social support: Lower-class individuals may have limited social networks and support systems, which can make it more difficult to cope with the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from their communities.
6. Limited access to education and information: Lower-class individuals may have limited access to educational resources and information about prenatal care, childbirth, and parenting. This can result in a lack of knowledge about their options and rights, which can lead to suboptimal care or poor decision-making.
7. Language barriers: Individuals who are non-native speakers of the dominant language in their area may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or delays in diagnosis and treatment.
8. Limited access to advocacy services: Lower-class individuals may have limited access to legal aid or advocacy services, which can make it more difficult to navigate the legal system and protect their rights during pregnancy
