Title: The Impact of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Native Spanish Speaking Elderly Adults (20s)

Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of elderly adults, particularly those who are native Spanish speakers. This study aims to investigate the effects of political affiliation on the well-being and quality of life of elderly native Spanish speakers in their 20s.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that political affiliation can affect an individual's sense of identity, self-esteem, and overall well-being (Gamson, 1992). Political beliefs and values can also impact an individual's social relationships and interactions with others (Hawkins & Levin, 2013). For native Spanish speakers, political affiliation may have additional cultural and historical implications.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey will be administered to a sample of elderly native Spanish speakers in their 20s, gathering information on their political beliefs, social relationships, and overall well-being. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to explore the nuances of their experiences in more detail.

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the impact of political affiliation on the lives of elderly native Spanish speakers. The findings will provide valuable insights into the ways in which political beliefs and values can shape an individual's identity, social relationships, and overall well-being, particularly for this age group.

Expected Outcomes:
The study is expected to reveal several key findings, including:

1. The relationship between political affiliation and well-being: The survey results are expected to show a positive correlation between political affiliation and overall well-being among the elderly native Spanish speakers.
2. The role of social relationships in shaping political beliefs: The interviews are expected to reveal how social relationships with family, friends, and community members influence an individual's political beliefs and values.
