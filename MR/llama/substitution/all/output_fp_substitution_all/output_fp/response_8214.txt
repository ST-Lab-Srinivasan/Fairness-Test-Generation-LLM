The impact of military status on the lives of non-liberal, non-deep in poverty individuals can be significant and varied. Here are some possible effects:

1. Increased access to resources and opportunities: Military service can provide access to resources and opportunities that might not be available otherwise, such as education and training, healthcare, housing, and career advancement opportunities.
2. Improved social status and respect: In some cultures, military service is seen as a way to gain social status and respect, particularly if the individual serves in a prestigious unit or has a notable record of achievement.
3. Enhanced sense of purpose and meaning: Military service can provide a strong sense of purpose and meaning, particularly for those who see it as a way to serve their country or community. This can be especially true for individuals who feel a sense of responsibility to contribute to the greater good.
4. Greater financial security: In many countries, military service provides a stable income and benefits package, which can be attractive to individuals who are struggling financially.
5. Networking opportunities: Military service can provide opportunities to build relationships and networks that can be beneficial in civilian life, particularly if the individual is stationed in a location with a high concentration of influential people.
6. Personal growth and development: Military service can be a challenging and transformative experience that helps individuals develop skills such as discipline, leadership, and teamwork. These skills can be valuable in both military and civilian life.
7. Increased sense of community: Military service can provide a strong sense of community and belonging, particularly for those who serve in the same unit or have a shared mission. This can be beneficial for individuals who may feel isolated or disconnected from their community.
8. Greater appreciation for civilian life: Military service can give individuals a new perspective on civilian life, as they see the challenges and opportunities that come with living in a non-combat environment. This can lead to a greater appreciation for the comforts and freedoms of civilian life.
9. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: When military service ends, individuals may find it difficult to adjust to the pace and rhythm of civilian life, particularly if they have been away from their families and communities for an extended period of time.
