Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native American recent temporary visa holders to the US, particularly those in their late middle age (18-19 years old). Here are some ways mentorship can support these individuals:

1. Cultural understanding and adaptation: As a Native American immigrant, navigating a new cultural environment can be challenging. A mentor who is familiar with the culture and customs of both the US and the individual's native culture can help them navigate these differences and adapt more smoothly to their new surroundings.
2. Language support: For Native American immigrants who may not speak English fluently, a mentor can provide language support and help them improve their communication skills. This can be especially important for those in their late middle age, as they may face additional challenges related to aging and cognitive decline.
3. Networking opportunities: A mentor can introduce the individual to relevant networks and resources, such as professional organizations, community groups, or cultural events. These connections can help them build a support system and establish new relationships in their host country.
4. Personal guidance: A mentor can offer personalized guidance and advice based on their own experiences, helping the individual navigate common challenges faced by immigrants, such as discrimination, isolation, or cultural shock. This personalized support can be especially important for those in their late middle age, who may face additional challenges related to aging and health issues.
5. Career development: A mentor can help the individual identify and pursue career opportunities that align with their skills and interests, particularly in industries or fields where they have experience or expertise. This can be particularly important for Native American immigrants who may face additional challenges related to discrimination or limited access to resources and opportunities.
6. Emotional support: A mentor can provide emotional support and a listening ear, helping the individual cope with the stressors of immigration, such as cultural adjustment, language barriers, or family separation. This support can be especially important for those in their late middle age, who may face additional challenges related to aging and health issues.
7. Cultural preservation: A mentor can help the individual preserve their cultural identity and traditions, particularly if they are part of a small or isolated community. This
