To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner Chinese speaker and beginner French speaker individuals, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Survey Research: Conduct surveys among beginner learners of Chinese and French to gather data on their language learning experiences, challenges, and goals. You could ask questions about their motivation for learning the language, their level of proficiency, and the difficulties they face in the learning process.
2. Language Learning App Data: Analyze data from language learning apps such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to identify patterns and trends among beginner learners. You could look at metrics such as the number of learners, time spent on the app, and progress made towards language proficiency goals.
3. Social Media Analytics: Use social media analytics tools to analyze online conversations and posts related to language learning. You could identify common challenges and questions asked by beginner learners, and compare them across different languages.
4. Online Language Courses Data: Analyze data from online language courses such as Coursera, Udemy, or edX to understand the demographics of beginner learners, their learning preferences, and the topics they find most challenging.
5. User-Generated Content: Collect and analyze user-generated content from social media platforms, blogs, and language learning communities to identify common themes and challenges faced by beginner learners.
6. Language Exchange Platform Data: Analyze data from language exchange platforms such as Tandem or HelloTalk to understand the demographics of beginner learners, their language proficiency levels, and the topics they want to learn.
7. Educational Institution Data: Analyze data from educational institutions that offer Chinese or French language courses to understand the demographics of their students, their learning outcomes, and the challenges they face.
8. Neurological Studies: Use neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG) to study the brain activity of beginner learners while they are learning a language. This can help identify the neural mechanisms underlying language learning and how they differ across languages.
9. Language Acquisition Theories: Review existing theories of language acquisition to understand how beginners acquire Chinese or French, and how these theories can
