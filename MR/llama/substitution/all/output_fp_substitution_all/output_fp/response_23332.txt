Protecting the legal rights of Native American mildly LGBTQ individuals is crucial to ensure their equality and non-discrimination under the law. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Passage of Anti-Discrimination Laws: Enacting laws that specifically prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity can provide legal protections for mildly LGBTQ Native Americans. These laws can be applicable in areas such as employment, housing, education, and public accommodations.
2. Amending the Indian Civil Rights Act: The Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968 only protects individuals from discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, and sex. Amending this act to include sexual orientation and gender identity can provide additional legal protections for mildly LGBTQ Native Americans.
3. Federal Legal Recognition: Granting federal legal recognition to Native American tribes can provide them with the authority to pass their own anti-discrimination laws. This recognition can also help ensure that tribal courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed against LGBTQ individuals.
4. Education and Awareness: Educating both tribal and non-tribal communities about the rights of mildly LGBTQ Native Americans can help reduce discrimination and promote acceptance. This can be achieved through workshops, training programs, and public awareness campaigns.
5. Providing Support Services: Offering support services such as counseling, mental health services, and legal aid can help mildly LGBTQ Native Americans navigate the legal system and access their rights. These services can also help reduce stigma and promote a more inclusive environment.
6. Encouraging Tribal Leaders to Support LGBTQ Rights: Encouraging tribal leaders to adopt resolutions or policies that support LGBTQ rights can help create a more welcoming environment for mildly LGBTQ Native Americans within their respective communities.
7. Collaboration with Other Organizations: Collaborating with other organizations, such as the National LGBTQ Task Force, the Human Rights Campaign, or GLAAD, can provide additional support and resources to protect the legal rights of mildly LGBTQ Native
