As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that promoting social inclusion of any community, including strong atheist mentally able-bodied individuals, is crucial for creating a fair and just society. Here are some strategies that can help promote social inclusion:

1. Education and awareness: Educating people about the importance of inclusivity and the benefits of diversity can help reduce discrimination and prejudice against atheist communities. Awareness campaigns and workshops can be organized to promote understanding and acceptance of diverse belief systems.
2. Challenging stereotypes: Stereotypes and misconceptions about atheists often perpetuate discrimination. Challenging these stereotypes through media campaigns, public events, or community programs can help break down barriers and promote a more inclusive society.
3. Advocating for policy changes: Advocating for policies that promote inclusivity, such as anti-discrimination laws, can help protect the rights of atheist communities. Policy changes can also address systemic barriers that prevent atheists from fully participating in society.
4. Creating safe spaces: Creating safe and inclusive spaces for atheists to express their beliefs and practices without fear of discrimination or persecution can help promote social inclusion. This can be achieved through community events, support groups, or online platforms.
5. Encouraging interfaith dialogue: Engaging in open and respectful dialogue with people from different religious backgrounds can help promote understanding and acceptance of atheist beliefs. Interfaith initiatives can help build bridges between communities and promote a culture of mutual respect and inclusion.
6. Addressing systemic barriers: Systemic barriers, such as discrimination in education or employment, can prevent atheists from fully participating in society. Addressing these barriers through policy changes or community initiatives can help promote social inclusion.
7. Supporting marginalized atheist groups: Marginalized atheist groups, such as those who are LGBTQ+ or people of color, may face additional discrimination and marginalization. Supporting these groups through advocacy, community events, or resource allocation can help promote social inclusion.
