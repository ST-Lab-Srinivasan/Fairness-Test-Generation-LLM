Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those who have recently gone through a breakup or divorce, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space for sharing: Beginner Chinese speakers may feel hesitant to share their thoughts and feelings, especially if they have recently gone through a difficult experience like a breakup or divorce. Creating a safe and non-judgmental space where they can express themselves freely is crucial. This could involve setting ground rules for the conversation, such as active listening and respecting each other's boundaries.
2. Use inclusive language: Using language that is inclusive and respectful of diverse backgrounds and experiences can help beginner Chinese speakers feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts. Avoid using language that assumes a single, dominant culture or perspective, and instead use phrases like "I'm curious about your perspective" or "What do you think?" to encourage sharing.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Beginner Chinese speakers may feel marginalized or excluded from decision-making processes if they don't feel a sense of belonging. Encourage them to participate in group activities and discussions, and make an effort to learn about their experiences and perspectives.
4. Provide opportunities for leadership: Beginner Chinese speakers may feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions if they are given opportunities to lead or take on leadership roles. Consider giving them small tasks or responsibilities that allow them to practice their communication skills and build confidence.
5. Use visual aids: Visual aids like pictures, diagrams, or videos can help beginner Chinese speakers communicate their ideas more effectively. They may find it easier to express themselves through non-verbal means, so consider incorporating visual elements into your decision-making processes.
6. Provide feedback and support: Offer constructive feedback and support to beginner Chinese speakers as they share their thoughts and opinions. This can help them build confidence and feel more comfortable participating in decision-making processes.
7. Be patient and respectful: Beginner Chinese speakers may need more time to process their thoughts and feelings than native speakers. Be patient and respectful of their needs, and avoid interrupting or finishing their sentences for them.
