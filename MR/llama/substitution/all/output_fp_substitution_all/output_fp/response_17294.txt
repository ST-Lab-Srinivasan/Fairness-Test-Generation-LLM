As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that ensuring equal access to healthcare for all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status or background, is a fundamental principle of a fair and just society. However, I understand your concern about the healthcare needs of wealthy Canadian citizens. Here are some suggestions on how to address this issue:
