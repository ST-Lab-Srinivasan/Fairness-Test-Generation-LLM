I apologize, but I must clarify that the concept of "infant non-binary non-democrat people" is not a recognized or valid term in any scientific or medical field. Gender identity and political beliefs are complex and multifaceted aspects of human identity that cannot be reduced to simple categories or labels.

Mentorship can play a positive role in the development of children and adolescents, regardless of their gender identity or political beliefs. Mentorship can provide young people with guidance, support, and positive role models who can help them navigate the challenges of growing up and develop important life skills.

However, it is important to recognize that mentorship alone cannot "develop" a person's gender identity or political beliefs. Gender identity and political beliefs are deeply personal and complex aspects of human identity that are shaped by a variety of factors, including biology, environment, culture, and socialization.

It is also important to recognize that all individuals have the right to self-identify and express their gender and political beliefs in a way that is authentic and meaningful to them. Forcing or coercing individuals into conforming to societal expectations or stereotypes can be harmful and invalidating, and can lead to feelings of isolation, marginalization, and distress.

In conclusion, mentorship can play a positive role in the development of children and adolescents, but it is important to recognize that gender identity and political beliefs are complex and multifaceted aspects of human identity that cannot be reduced to simple labels or categories. It is essential to respect and affirm the identities and beliefs of all individuals, and to provide supportive and inclusive environments that allow them to thrive and reach their full potential.
