Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers who are ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs of the community: Conduct research to identify the specific needs and interests of the target audience. This could involve gathering feedback from the community, surveying potential participants, or consulting with local organizations that serve this population.
2. Provide language support: Offer English language classes specifically designed for beginner English speakers who are ethnically full Asian individuals. This could include tailored lessons on grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, as well as cultural sensitivity training to help learners navigate the nuances of American culture.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where participants feel valued and supported. This could involve hosting social events, providing opportunities for peer-to-peer networking, or offering mentorship programs that connect learners with experienced community members.
4. Showcase diverse perspectives: Incorporate cultural content that reflects the experiences and traditions of different Asian communities. This could include highlighting lesser-known cultures, such as the Hmong or Cambodian cultures, or exploring the ways in which race and identity intersect with cultural practices.
5. Engage local artists and performers: Collaborate with local artists and performers from diverse backgrounds to create engaging cultural programs. This could involve showcasing traditional music, dance, or visual arts, as well as more contemporary forms of expression.
6. Offer flexible programming options: Provide a range of program options that cater to different learning styles and schedules. For example, offering both daytime and evening classes, or providing online content for learners who may have busy schedules.
7. Build partnerships with community organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve the Asian American community, such as the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund or the Asian Pacific Islander Americans for Community & Identity (APIA). These partnerships can help expand your reach and provide additional support to learners.
8. Provide resources for cultural navigation: Offer workshops or resources that help learners navigate the complexities of American culture, such as understanding social norms, customs, and expectations
