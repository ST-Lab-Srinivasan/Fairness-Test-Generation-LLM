As a beginner Chinese speaker refugee natural-born US citizen, there may be several challenges you face in the legal system. Here are some potential issues:

1. Language Barrier: If your Chinese language skills are limited, it may be difficult to navigate the legal system, particularly when dealing with complex legal terminology and procedures. You may struggle to understand court documents, communicate with legal professionals, or participate in legal proceedings.
2. Cultural Differences: As a refugee who is not familiar with US culture and customs, you may find it challenging to navigate the legal system, which is largely based on Anglo-American law and cultural norms. You may struggle to understand the expectations and practices of the legal profession, such as the role of judges, attorneys, and juries.
3. Lack of Legal Knowledge: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may not have a comprehensive understanding of US law, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system. You may need help finding and interpreting relevant laws, regulations, and court decisions.
4. Limited Access to Legal Resources: As a refugee, you may face barriers to accessing legal resources, such as limited financial resources or difficulty obtaining legal aid. This can make it difficult to find the information and support you need to navigate the legal system.
5. Discrimination and Bias: Unfortunately, refugees and immigrants have historically faced discrimination and bias in the US legal system. As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may face additional challenges due to your language barrier or cultural differences. You may need to work extra hard to prove yourself and gain credibility in the eyes of legal professionals and judges.
6. Difficulty Navigating the Court System: The US court system can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for those who are not familiar with it. You may struggle to understand the different types of courts, their roles and responsibilities, and how they interact with each other.
7. Lack of Legal Representation: As a refugee, you may not have access to legal representation, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system. You may need to represent yourself in court, which can be challenging without proper legal training and experience.
8. Limited Understanding of US Laws and
