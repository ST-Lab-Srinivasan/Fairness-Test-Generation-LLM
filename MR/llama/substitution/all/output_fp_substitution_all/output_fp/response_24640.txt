As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the term "natural-born citizen" is a legal concept with specific meanings and implications under US law. It is not a universally applicable term and may have different interpretations depending on the context.

1. Name change: One of the most common challenges faced by newly married couples is changing their names to reflect their marital status. This can involve updating personal documents such as driver's licenses, passports, and social security cards.
2. Property rights: Marriage can create new property rights, including shared ownership of property and assets. However, navigating these legal issues can be complex, particularly if the couple has different financial backgrounds or if they are entering a marriage with existing assets.
3. Spousal support: In the event of a divorce or separation, spousal support (also known as alimony) may become an issue. Couples must navigate the legal system to determine who is eligible for support and how much should be paid.
