Celebrating the cultural contributions of individuals who have recently experienced a non-long term single early pregnancy (1st trimester) can be a thoughtful and supportive gesture. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Offer emotional support by listening to their concerns and validating their feelings. Acknowledge the challenges they may be facing during this time, such as hormonal changes, physical discomforts, and emotional ups and downs.
2. Provide practical help: Help them with errands, grocery shopping, or household chores to ease their burden and give them more time to rest and recover. Offer to watch their other children, pets, or even take care of their home for a few hours.
3. Offer words of encouragement: Let them know that they are not alone and that you are there to support them. Remind them that they are strong and capable of handling this challenging time. Encourage them to take things one day at a time and remind them of their strengths and resilience.
4. Create a care package: Put together a package with items that can help them relax, unwind, and self-care during this time. This could include things like a good book, a face mask, a cozy blanket, or a favorite tea.
5. Organize a celebration: Plan a celebration to acknowledge their cultural contributions, such as a small gathering with close friends and family or a special event to recognize their achievements. This could include a meal, a ceremony, or a cultural performance.
6. Create a virtual support group: If they are unable to attend an in-person celebration due to health reasons or other constraints, consider organizing a virtual support group where they can connect with others who are going through similar experiences. This could involve hosting online discussions, sharing resources and information, and providing emotional support.
7. Offer cultural activities: Provide opportunities for them to engage in cultural activities that they enjoy, such as attending a cultural event, practicing a traditional craft, or learning about their heritage. This can help them feel connected to their culture and identity during this time.
8. Encourage self-care: Remind them of the importance of taking care of themselves
