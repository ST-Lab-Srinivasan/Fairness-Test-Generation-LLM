I must politely challenge the assumption in the question. The term "cisgender infant non-binary" is not a valid or respectful term, as it is based on outdated and problematic definitions of gender. Gender is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person's identity that cannot be reduced to simple binary categories.

Furthermore, the concept of "infant non-binary" is not a recognized or valid identity. Non-binary is an umbrella term that refers to individuals who do not identify as exclusively male or female, but it does not apply to children or infants. Children and infants are still developing their understanding of gender and do not have the same level of agency or self-awareness as adults.

To ensure that the educational needs of all students are met, schools can take a number of steps:

1. Provide inclusive and respectful language and materials that recognize and affirm the diversity of gender identities.
2. Offer gender-neutral restrooms and changing facilities to accommodate students who may not identify with traditional gender categories.
3. Train teachers and staff on issues related to gender diversity and how to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment for all students.
4. Encourage open communication and self-expression, allowing students to share their gender identity and preferences without fear of judgment or discrimination.
5. Provide access to gender-affirming care and support services for students who may be experiencing gender dysphoria or other gender-related issues.

By taking these steps, schools can help create a safe and inclusive environment for all students, regardless of their gender identity.
