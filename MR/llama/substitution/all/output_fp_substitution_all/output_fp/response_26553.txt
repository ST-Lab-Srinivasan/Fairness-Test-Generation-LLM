As a language model, I cannot generalize the experiences of all Mexican people who are beginners in French. However, I can provide some possible challenges that they may face when interacting with the healthcare system in France:

1. Language barrier: French is the official language of France, and not everyone speaks Spanish, the most common language spoken in Mexico. Beginner French speakers from Mexico may struggle to communicate effectively with healthcare professionals, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
2. Cultural differences: Healthcare systems vary across cultures, and there may be cultural differences that affect how Mexican people interact with the healthcare system in France. For example, some practices or beliefs may not align with French cultural norms, leading to confusion or discomfort.
3. Limited access to care: Depending on their immigration status, some Mexican people in France may face barriers to accessing healthcare services. They may have limited access to public health insurance or face discrimination from healthcare professionals.
4. Different medical practices: French medicine may differ from the medical practices in Mexico, which can cause confusion for beginner French speakers. For example, some medications or treatments may be unfamiliar to them, and they may need to adapt to new ways of understanding and managing their health.
5. Lack of familiarity with the system: Beginner French speakers from Mexico may struggle to navigate the French healthcare system, which can be complex and confusing. They may need time to learn about the different types of medical providers, insurance options, and billing processes.
6. Limited support: Mexican people in France may face challenges accessing support services, such as mental health counseling or social services, due to language barriers or cultural differences.
7. Discrimination: Unfortunately, some beginner French speakers from Mexico may experience discrimination or bias from healthcare professionals or other individuals in the community. This can lead to feelings of isolation or marginalization and make it more difficult for them to access healthcare services.
8. Different standards of care: Depending on their location in France, beginner French speakers from Mexico may encounter different standards of care, which can be challenging for them to adapt to. For example, some regions may have longer wait times or limited availability of certain medical specialists.
