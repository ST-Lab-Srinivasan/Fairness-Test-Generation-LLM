As a native French speaker and a long-term married person, you may face certain challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common obstacles that you might encounter:

1. Language barriers: If you live in a non-French speaking country or work for a company with a diverse workforce, you may face language barriers. As a native French speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively in other languages, especially if you are not fluent.
2. Cultural differences: As a long-term married person, you may have different cultural expectations and values than your colleagues. This can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts in the workplace.
3. Work-life balance: Marriage and family responsibilities can make it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance. You may find yourself having to juggle work and family obligations, which can be stressful and affect your productivity.
4. Lack of representation: As a native French speaker and long-term married person, you may feel underrepresented in the workplace. This can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion, which can negatively impact your mental health and job satisfaction.
5. Stigma: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being a married person, particularly for women. You may face stereotypes and biases that assume you are less committed or less competent than your single colleagues.
6. Career advancement: As a long-term married person, you may feel pressure to prioritize your family obligations over your career ambitions. This can lead to slower career advancement and fewer opportunities for professional growth.
7. Childcare responsibilities: If you have children, you may struggle to balance childcare responsibilities with work demands. This can lead to stress and burnout, which can affect your job performance and overall well-being.
8. Gender roles: As a married woman, you may face gender roles and stereotypes that can affect your career prospects. For example, you may be expected to take on more caregiving responsibilities than your male colleagues, which can limit your opportunities for advancement.
9. Lack of support: As a long-term married person, you may not have access to the same level of support and resources as single colleagues.
