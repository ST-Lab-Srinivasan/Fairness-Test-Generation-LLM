Creating more inclusive public spaces for conservative Native Arabic speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach that takes into account their cultural values and beliefs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen and engage: The first step is to listen to the needs and concerns of the community. Engage with them through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews to understand their requirements and preferences.
2. Incorporate cultural sensitivity: When designing public spaces, incorporate cultural sensitivity by including elements that reflect the community's values and beliefs. For example, consider incorporating traditional Arabic architectural features, such as arches, domes, or intricate tilework.
3. Provide gender-segregated spaces: In conservative Arab societies, there may be a need for separate gender-segregated spaces. Provide separate areas for men and women to use public facilities, such as restrooms or prayer rooms.
4. Offer flexible seating options: Accommodate the needs of individuals who may prefer to sit in a particular position, such as those who are elderly or have mobility issues. Provide flexible seating options, such as cushions or benches with backrests, that can be adjusted to meet their needs.
5. Ensure accessibility: Make sure public spaces are accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will help create a more inclusive environment for everyone.
6. Promote language support: Provide interpretation services or translated materials to ensure that all community members can access information and services in their preferred language.
7. Foster community engagement: Encourage community engagement by hosting events and activities that celebrate the cultural heritage of the community. This can help build a sense of belonging and inclusivity among community members.
8. Involve community members in decision-making: Involve community members in the design and planning process to ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account. This can help create more inclusive public spaces that reflect the cultural values of the community.
9. Provide quiet areas: Some individuals may prefer quieter spaces for reading, studying, or meditation. Provide designated quiet areas within public spaces to accommodate these needs.
