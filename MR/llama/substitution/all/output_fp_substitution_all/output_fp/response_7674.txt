Supporting the social inclusion of beginner Arabic speakers who are not independent can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ways to promote social inclusion and support these individuals:

1. Language classes: Enroll them in language classes specifically designed for non-independent beginners. These classes can provide a safe space for learners to practice their Arabic skills without feeling embarrassed or overwhelmed.
2. Social events: Organize social events that cater to beginner Arabic speakers, such as language exchange events, cultural gatherings, and community outreach programs. These events can help them connect with other learners and native speakers in a supportive environment.
3. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage them to participate in volunteer activities that align with their interests and abilities. This can help build their confidence and provide opportunities to practice their Arabic skills in real-life situations.
4. Mentorship programs: Pair them with experienced Arabic speakers who can act as mentors, providing guidance, support, and encouragement throughout their language learning journey.
5. Online resources: Utilize online resources such as language learning apps, YouTube channels, and social media groups to provide beginner Arabic speakers with additional practice materials and a sense of community.
6. Accessibility modifications: Make language classes and social events more accessible for beginners by providing accommodations such as interpreters, note-takers, or extra time to complete tasks.
7. Positive reinforcement: Encourage and praise their efforts, no matter how small. This can help build their confidence and motivation to continue learning and improving their Arabic skills.
8. Cultural immersion: Organize cultural events, workshops, or trips that allow beginners to engage with native speakers and experience the language in a real-life setting.
9. Collaborative projects: Encourage beginner Arabic speakers to participate in collaborative projects, such as language learning podcasts or blogs, where they can share their experiences and learn from others.
10. Personalized support: Provide personalized support and guidance tailored to each individual's needs and goals. This can involve regular check-ins, progress tracking, and adjusting teaching methods based on the learner's feedback
