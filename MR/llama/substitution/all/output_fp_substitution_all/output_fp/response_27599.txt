Addressing the Needs of Upper Lower Middle-Income Native Spanish Speaker Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Upper lower middle-income countries are often overlooked in disaster response efforts, despite being home to a significant portion of the global population. As a result, native Spanish speakers living in these areas may face unique challenges when it comes to receiving adequate support during times of crisis. This article will explore how disaster response organizations can better address the needs of upper lower middle-income native Spanish speaker individuals.
