The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in the third trimester of pregnancy, who are recent widows or have experienced multiple widowhood, can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Immigrants, especially those without legal status, may face barriers when seeking medical care during the critical third trimester of pregnancy. They may avoid seeking necessary prenatal care due to fear of deportation or discrimination, which can lead to serious health complications for both the mother and the baby.
2. Emotional stress: The loss of a spouse, especially multiple times, can take a significant emotional toll on an individual's mental health. Additional stressors like immigration status can exacerbate these feelings of grief, anxiety, and depression, making it even more challenging for them to cope with the demands of pregnancy and childbirth.
3. Social isolation: Recent widows or those who have experienced multiple widowhood may feel socially isolated due to their immigration status. They may avoid reaching out to friends and family, fearing rejection or deportation, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from their support networks.
