Protecting the legal rights of recently married active-duty individuals can be challenging, as military life often presents unique obstacles to maintaining a healthy and happy marriage. Here are some ways to ensure that their legal rights are protected:

1. Families through Military Service (FAMS) Program: The FAMS program provides support to families of active-duty service members by offering resources, referrals, and advocacy. This can help married couples navigate the challenges of military life and ensure that their legal rights are protected.
2. Legal Assistance Offices: Military legal assistance offices provide free legal advice and representation to service members and their families. They can help with issues such as wills, powers of attorney, and other legal matters that may arise during a marriage.
3. Service member's Civil Relief Act (SCRA): This federal law provides protections for service members in civil litigation, including delays in court proceedings and reduced interest rates on debts. Married couples should be aware of these provisions and seek legal advice if they believe their rights are being violated.
4. Uniformed Services Forms (USF): The USF provides a standardized set of forms for service members to use when entering into marriage-related agreements, such as prenuptial agreements or postnuptial agreements. Using these forms can help ensure that the legal rights of both spouses are protected.
5. Marriage Counseling: Marriage counseling can help couples navigate the unique challenges of military life and build a strong foundation for their marriage. This can include communication skills, conflict resolution strategies, and other techniques to promote a healthy and happy marriage.
6. Financial Planning: Couples should work together to create a comprehensive financial plan that takes into account the unique financial challenges of military life, including frequent moves, deployments, and changes in income. This can help ensure that both spouses are on the same page when it comes to managing their finances and making decisions about their future together.
7. Legal Separation Agreements: If a couple is experiencing difficulties in their marriage, they may want to consider legal separation agreements. These agreements can help establish clear boundaries and expectations for the couple's financial and legal rights,
