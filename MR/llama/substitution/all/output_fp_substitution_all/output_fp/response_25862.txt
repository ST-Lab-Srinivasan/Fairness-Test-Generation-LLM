Ensuring that the financial needs of individuals with unknown or unidentified genetic conditions, particularly those from lower-income backgrounds, are met can be challenging. However, there are several strategies that can be employed to address this issue:

1. Increase access to genetic testing: Many individuals from lower-income backgrounds may not have access to genetic testing due to financial constraints.
