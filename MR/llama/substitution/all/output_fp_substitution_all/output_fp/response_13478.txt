It is important to note that the concept of "native French speakers" and "extreme ultra-conservative individuals" can be subjective and may not be mutually exclusive. However, I will do my best to provide a general answer based on available data and research.

The impact of military status on the lives of native French speakers can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances and cultural context. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social stigma: In some societies, individuals with a military background may face social stigma or discrimination, particularly if they come from marginalized groups such as racial or ethnic minorities. This can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion, which can have a profound impact on mental health and well-being.
2. Career opportunities: Military service can provide valuable skills and experience that may be beneficial in civilian life. However, some native French speakers may face challenges when transitioning to civilian careers due to the perceived stigma of military service or a lack of relevant job training or education.
3. Financial stability: Military service can provide financial security through salary and benefits, which may be particularly important for families or individuals with dependents.
