Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are not long-time single individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Targeted outreach: Reach out to local communities, organizations, and groups that cater to beginner Chinese learners, such as language schools, community centers, and cultural associations. Advertise your program through these channels to attract a diverse group of participants.
2. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible class schedules to accommodate different learners' needs, such as evening or weekend classes. This will enable individuals who may have work or family commitments during the day to participate.
3. Small class sizes: Keep class sizes small to ensure each learner receives personalized attention and support. This will help beginners feel more comfortable and confident in their language learning journey.
4. Interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities into your program, such as group discussions, role-playing, and cultural events. These activities will help learners practice their speaking and listening skills in a relaxed environment, making the learning experience more enjoyable and inclusive.

This could involve offering different teaching methods, such as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic, to cater to learners' different learning styles.
8. Accessibility: Ensure that your program is accessible to all learners by providing accommodations for individuals with disabilities, such as sign language interpretation or wheelchair accessibility.
9. Cultural events and activities: Organize cultural events and activities that showcase the diversity of Chinese-speaking communities, such as traditional music, dance, or food festivals. This will help
