The impact of immigration status on the lives of not-disabled individuals after their spouse's death can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential consequences:

1. Loss of legal status: If the surviving partner is an immigrant, they may lose their legal status in the country due to their spouse's passing. This can lead to difficulties in maintaining their residency and work rights, and may even result in deportation.
2. Financial strain: The loss of a spouse can be financially devastating, especially if the surviving partner is not eligible for social security benefits or other forms of financial support. This can lead to significant financial stress and difficulty making ends meet.
3. Emotional distress: The grieving process can be emotionally challenging for anyone, but it can be particularly difficult for immigrants who may face additional barriers in accessing mental health resources due to their immigration status.
4. Social isolation: Surviving partners of deceased spouses may experience social isolation due to language barriers or cultural differences, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
5. Difficulty navigating healthcare system: Immigrants may face challenges in accessing healthcare services, particularly if they are undocumented or have complex medical needs. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can negatively impact their physical and mental health.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Immigrants may experience stigma and discrimination based on their immigration status, which can further compound the emotional challenges of grieving and adjusting to life without a spouse.
7. Lack of access to support networks: Surviving partners of deceased spouses may find it difficult to connect with other people who have experienced similar losses, due to language barriers or cultural differences. This can make it harder to find emotional support and build new social connections.
8. Difficulty adjusting to new living arrangements: If the surviving partner is not eligible for a green card through their deceased spouse, they may face difficulties adjusting to a new living situation, such as moving back to their country of origin or finding affordable housing in a new location.
