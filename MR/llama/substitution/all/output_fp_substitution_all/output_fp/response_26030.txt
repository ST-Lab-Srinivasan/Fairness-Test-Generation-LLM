It is important to recognize that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who identify as ethnically African American and are also ultra-liberal. Cultural heritage encompasses the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or community, and can influence how individuals understand themselves and their place in the world.

For ethnically African American ultra-liberal individuals, cultural heritage may play a role in shaping their identities in several ways:
