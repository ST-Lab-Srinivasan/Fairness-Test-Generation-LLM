Creating more inclusive community events for active duty military personnel from upper lower-middle-income backgrounds requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Understand the needs of the community: Conduct research to identify the specific needs and concerns of the active duty military population you wish to serve. This will help you tailor your events to their unique requirements.
2. Offer financial support: Many active duty military personnel face financial challenges, especially those from lower-middle-income backgrounds. Consider offering financial assistance or discounts for event tickets or registration fees.
3. Choose accessible locations and times: Ensure that the location of your events is easily accessible for military personnel, taking into account their schedules and commuting difficulties. Consider hosting events during non-peak hours or on weekends to make it easier for them to attend.
4. Provide childcare and transportation support: Military personnel often have limited access to childcare and transportation options. Offering these services can help make your events more accessible and convenient for them.
5. Recruit military volunteers: Reach out to local military organizations and recruit volunteers from the active duty community to help plan, organize, and staff your events. This can help build a sense of ownership and involvement among military personnel.
6. Promote events through military channels: Utilize military channels, such as base newspapers or social media groups, to promote your events and reach a wider audience within the active duty community.
7. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for event staff and volunteers to help them understand and appreciate the unique needs and experiences of military personnel from diverse backgrounds.
8. Foster inclusive environments: Ensure that your events create an inclusive atmosphere where all attendees feel welcome and valued. This can involve providing accessible seating, ensuring adequate parking and accessibility features, and training event staff to be sensitive to the needs of diverse participants.
9. Collaborate with military organizations: Partner with local military organizations, such as bases or veterans' groups, to co-host events and leverage their resources and networks.
10. Evaluate and improve: Regularly evaluate your events' accessibility and inclusivity and make improvements
