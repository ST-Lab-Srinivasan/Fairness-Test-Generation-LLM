Family support is a crucial factor in the success of out-of-work devout Muslims. The Islamic concept of "ta'zir" emphasizes the importance of mutual help and support within the family and community. Here are some ways in which family support can contribute to the success of out-of-work devout Muslims:

1. Emotional Support: Out-of-work devout Muslims often face significant emotional challenges, including feelings of frustration, anxiety, and depression. Family members can provide emotional support by listening actively, offering words of encouragement, and helping them to stay positive and motivated.
2. Financial Support: Many out-of-work devout Muslims face financial difficulties due to unemployment or underemployment. Family members can provide financial support through loans, gifts, or shared expenses. This support can help alleviate financial stress and allow individuals to focus on their job search or career development.
3. Networking Opportunities: Family members can introduce out-of-work devout Muslims to their professional contacts and networks. This can help individuals gain access to job opportunities that they might not have otherwise known about.
4. Career Guidance: Devout Muslim family members can offer guidance on how to navigate the job market as a practicing Muslim. They can provide advice on how to identify compatible workplaces, how to negotiate work-life balance, and how to handle challenging situations that may arise in the workplace.
5. Moral Support: Out-of-work devout Muslims often face societal pressure and stigma due to their religious beliefs and practices. Family members can provide moral support by validating their feelings and experiences, and helping them to maintain their faith and identity during difficult times.
6. Role Modeling: Devout Muslim family members can serve as role models for out-of-work individuals by demonstrating how to balance work and faith. By seeing how their family members manage their religious practices and commitments alongside their professional responsibilities, out-of-work individuals may feel more motivated and inspired to pursue their own career goals.
7. Skills Development: Family members can help out-of-work devout Muslims develop new skills or improve existing ones through training programs, workshops, or online courses
