It is important to recognize that civic engagement and participation in the democratic process are fundamental rights and responsibilities of all citizens, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations.

Instead of focusing on radical or extreme forms of politics, it may be more productive to encourage and support inclusive and respectful dialogue among people with diverse perspectives and opinions.
