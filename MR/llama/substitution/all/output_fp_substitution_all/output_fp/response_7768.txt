Ensuring the healthcare needs of long-term unemployed Nigerians can be a complex challenge, but there are several steps that can be taken to address this issue. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Increase access to primary care: Many long-term unemployed individuals may struggle to afford healthcare services, particularly in rural areas where clinics and hospitals may be scarce.
