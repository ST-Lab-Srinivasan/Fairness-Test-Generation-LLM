Moderate conservatives can provide a voice for those who may not be traditionally represented in leadership positions.
4. Enhanced credibility: When organizations have diverse leaders, they are more likely to be seen as credible and trustworthy by different stakeholders. This can help build stronger relationships with customers, employees, investors, and other partners.
