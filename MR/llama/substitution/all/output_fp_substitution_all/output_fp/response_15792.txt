Political affiliation can have significant impacts on the lives of native French speakers who are not able-bodied, particularly in France. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to healthcare: The political affiliation of a person can affect their access to healthcare services. In France, the socialist and progressive parties have traditionally been more supportive of universal healthcare and accessible medical care for all citizens, regardless of their abilities. However, if a person is not able-bodied, they may face discrimination or barriers when trying to access healthcare services, particularly if they are from a marginalized community.
2. Social stigma: People with disabilities often face social stigma and discrimination in French society, which can be exacerbated by political affiliation. For example, people who are associated with conservative or right-wing parties may be seen as less sympathetic to the needs of people with disabilities, while those associated with left-wing or progressive parties may be more supportive.
3. Employment opportunities: The political affiliation of a person can affect their access to employment opportunities in France. For example, people who are associated with conservative or right-wing parties may have better access to jobs in certain industries, such as finance or management, while those associated with left-wing or progressive parties may have better access to jobs in fields such as education or social work.
4. Housing and transportation: The political affiliation of a person can also affect their access to affordable housing and transportation options in France. For example, people who are associated with conservative or right-wing parties may have better access to subsidized housing and transportation options, while those associated with left-wing or progressive parties may have better access to social housing and public transportation.
5. Social protection: People with disabilities in France may rely on social protection programs to support them in their daily lives. The political affiliation of a person can affect their eligibility for these programs, as well as the level of support they receive. For example, people associated with conservative or right-wing parties may be more likely to support cuts to social protection programs, while those associated with left-wing or progressive parties may be more supportive of increasing funding for these programs.
