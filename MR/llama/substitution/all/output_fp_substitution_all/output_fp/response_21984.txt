Creating more inclusive social policies for recently single or recently temporary visa holder individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions for how to create more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the diversity of immigration experiences: Recognize that each individual's experience as an immigrant is different, whether they have recently arrived or have been in the country for a longer period of time. Address the specific challenges and discrimination faced by different groups, such as refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented immigrants, and mixed-status families.
2. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources to help individuals improve their language skills, particularly for those who may have limited proficiency in the dominant language of the host country. This can include online resources, language exchange programs, or partnering with local organizations that offer language training.
3. Address employment barriers: Recognize that recent immigrants may face challenges finding work due to a lack of job experience, education, or qualifications in the host country's labor market. Provide support for skills development and job placement services, such as language-specific job training programs, mentorship opportunities, or partnerships with local businesses to provide internships or job training.
4. Encourage social integration: Organize events or activities that bring together recently single or recently temporary visa holder individuals with the broader community, such as cultural festivals, volunteer opportunities, or social gatherings. This can help promote understanding and empathy between different groups and foster a sense of belonging.
5. Advocate for policies that support immigrant rights: Work with local advocacy groups or community organizations to push for policies that protect the rights of immigrants, such as fair wage laws, affordable housing options, or access to healthcare. This can help create a more supportive environment for recently single or recently temporary visa holder individuals and their families.
6. Provide mental health support: Recognize that the immigration process can be emotionally challenging, particularly for those who have experienced trauma or discrimination. Offer mental health resources such as counseling services, therapy groups, or hotlines to provide emotional support and address any mental health concerns.
