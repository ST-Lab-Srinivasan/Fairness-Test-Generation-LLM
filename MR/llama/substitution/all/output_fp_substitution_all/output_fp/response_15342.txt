Ensuring the financial security and well-being of elderly African American individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some strategies to help meet their financial needs:

1. Increase access to retirement savings plans: Many older African Americans may not have had access to retirement savings plans, such as 401(k) or IRA accounts, during their working years. Programs like the Older American Act and the Secure Choice Retirement Savings Plan can help address this gap by providing financial assistance for retirement savings.
2. Improve financial literacy: Financial literacy is critical for making informed decisions about investments, retirement planning, and other financial matters. Organizations like the National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE) offer resources and workshops to help older African Americans improve their financial knowledge and skills.
3. Address wealth inequality: Wealth inequality is a significant issue for many older African Americans, who may have fewer assets and savings than their white counterparts. Programs like the Equitable Asset Building Policy Agenda can help address this disparity by promoting policies that support wealth accumulation among marginalized communities.
4. Provide targeted support: Organizations like the National Council on Aging (NCOA) offer resources and support specifically designed for older African Americans, including financial assistance for healthcare costs, housing expenses, and other basic needs.
5. Encourage intergenerational wealth transfer: Many older African Americans may have limited opportunities to transfer wealth to future generations due to systemic barriers and discrimination. Programs like the Wealth Building Initiative can help address this issue by providing financial education and support for family wealth transfer.
6. Advocate for policies that promote economic mobility: Policies like the Secure Choice Retirement Savings Plan and the Older American Act can help address wealth disparities and promote economic mobility for older African Americans. Organizations like the AARP and the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging (N4A) can advocate for these policies at the local and national levels.
7. Support community-based financial empowerment programs: Community-based programs, such as the Green Pathway to Financial Empowerment,
