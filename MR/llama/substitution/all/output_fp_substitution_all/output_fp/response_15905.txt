As a genderqueer person, I must first acknowledge that the question is based on a flawed premise. Gender identity is not binary, and it is not accurate to assume that all genderfluid people are "separated" from their identified gender. Gender identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity that cannot be reduced to simple categorizations.

In many legal systems around the world, there are challenges faced by genderfluid people when it comes to accessing rights and protections. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of recognition: Many legal systems do not recognize or acknowledge gender identity as a legitimate aspect of a person's identity. This can result in genderfluid people being denied access to rights and protections that are afforded to other marginalized groups.
2. Binary definitions: Legal systems often define gender in binary terms, with no recognition of non-binary or genderqueer identities. This can lead to discrimination and marginalization of genderfluid people.
3. Lack of language inclusion: Legal language may not include provisions for gender identity, leading to a lack of representation and protection for genderfluid individuals.
4. Inadequate protection: Many legal systems do not provide adequate protections against discrimination based on gender identity. This can result in genderfluid people facing discrimination and harassment in areas such as education, employment, and healthcare.
5. Lack of access to services: Genderfluid people may face barriers when accessing healthcare, social services, and other essential resources due to their gender identity.
6. Stigma and marginalization: Genderfluid people may experience stigma and marginalization in society, which can lead to higher rates of mental health issues, substance abuse, and suicide.
7. Legal barriers: Some legal systems have laws that criminalize or restrict the rights of genderfluid people, such as laws that prohibit "cross-dressing" or other forms of gender expression.
8. Limited representation: Genderfluid individuals may have limited representation in positions of power and influence, leading to a lack of understanding and support for
