1. Provide opportunities for language immersion: Encourage your partner to spend time in China or surround themselves with other Chinese speakers to practice their language skills and immerse themselves in the culture.
2. Enroll in a language course together: Look for local language schools or online courses that offer beginner-friendly classes, and enroll in them together. This will give you both a structured learning environment and the opportunity to learn from each other's progress.
3. Use language learning apps: There are many free and paid language learning apps available that can help your partner learn Chinese. Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone are popular options.

6. Be a language learning buddy: Offer to learn alongside your partner, taking turns practicing speaking and listening to each other. This can be a fun and supportive way to learn together.
7. Celebrate progress: Acknowledge and celebrate your partner's progress and achievements in learning Chinese, no matter how small. This will help keep them motivated and engaged in the learning process.
8. Create a language-learning environment at home: Decorate your home with Chinese characters, play Chinese music, or watch Chinese TV shows to create an immersive language learning environment.
9. Seek out opportunities for cultural exchange: Look for opportunities to attend cultural events or host Chinese speakers in your home to expose yourself and your partner to different perspectives and ways of life.
10. Be patient and supportive: Learning a new language can be challenging, so it's important to be patient and supportive with your partner as they progress through the learning process.
