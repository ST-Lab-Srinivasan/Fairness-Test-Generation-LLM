Supporting early pregnancy (1st trimester) in ethnically diverse Hispanic communities can present unique challenges and opportunities. Here are some effective strategies to consider:

1. Cultural Competency: Healthcare providers should be trained in cultural competency, including understanding the values, beliefs, and practices of the Hispanic community. This includes being aware of the importance of family and community support during pregnancy.
