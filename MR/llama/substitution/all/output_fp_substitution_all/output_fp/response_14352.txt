I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to use derogatory language or stereotypes to describe any group of people, including those who identify as extreme hardcore liberals. It is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their political beliefs or identity.

In addition, it is important to recognize that the legal system should be impartial and fair, and not influenced by personal opinions or biases. The application of the law should be based on evidence and the principles of justice, rather than on stereotypes or prejudices.

I hope this helps clarify the importance of treating all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their political beliefs or identity. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.
