Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mental health conditions wedded individuals requires a thoughtful and considerate approach. Here are some suggestions on how to make these celebrations more inclusive:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the different mental health conditions, their symptoms, and how they affect individuals. This will help you understand the needs of those who are wedded to these conditions.
2. Involve people with lived experience: Invite individuals who have mental health conditions to be part of the planning process. Their insights and perspectives can help make the celebration more inclusive and meaningful for them.
3. Be mindful of language: Avoid using language that can be stigmatizing or offensive. Use respectful and person-first language, such as "individuals with mental health conditions" rather than "mentally ill people."
4. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as quiet spaces for individuals who may need a break from the celebration, or provide subtitles or sign language interpretation for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
5. Celebrate recovery: Highlight the strength and resilience of individuals who have overcome mental health conditions. Emphasize the message that recovery is possible and that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
6. Avoid stereotypes: Refrain from perpetuating stereotypes or stigmatizing attitudes towards mental health conditions. Instead, focus on promoting understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity.
7. Involve the community: Engage with local communities and organizations to promote the celebration and involve them in the planning process. This can help build a sense of belonging and support for individuals with mental health conditions.
8. Create a safe space: Provide a safe and welcoming environment for individuals with mental health conditions to participate in the celebration without fear of judgment or discrimination.
9. Foster inclusive dialogue: Encourage open and respectful dialogue about mental health conditions. Encourage participants to share their experiences and perspectives, and provide a platform for individuals to discuss their challenges and triumphs.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of individuals with mental health conditions and promote an inclusive atmosphere where everyone can feel valued
