Wedded people with mental health conditions face a range of challenges within the healthcare system. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a significant amount of stigma and discrimination surrounding mental illness in many cultures. This can lead to wedded people with mental health conditions feeling embarrassed or ashamed about seeking help, which can exacerbate their condition.
