I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality towards any particular group of people, including ethnic African American students. All students, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity in the educational setting.

Instead of focusing on labeling students as "extreme soft liberals" or any other categorization, it's important to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment that promotes academic success for all students. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultivate a growth mindset: Encourage students to embrace challenges and view failures as opportunities for growth. Provide feedback and support to help them develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
2. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a classroom environment where all students feel valued, seen, and heard. Encourage respectful dialogue and open communication among students, and provide opportunities for students to share their perspectives and experiences.
3. Provide access to resources and support: Ensure that all students have access to the resources they need to succeed academically, such as tutoring, academic coaches, or extra help sessions. Offer support services, such as counseling or mentoring, for students who may be struggling with personal or academic issues.
4. Promote cultural competence: Educate yourself and your colleagues about the cultural backgrounds and experiences of your students. Provide opportunities for students to share their cultural practices and traditions, and create a curriculum that reflects diverse perspectives and histories.
5. Advocate for policies that promote equity: Work with school administrators and policymakers to advocate for policies that promote equity and address systemic barriers to success for students of color or other marginalized groups.

By implementing these strategies, you can help create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that promotes the educational success of all students, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs.
