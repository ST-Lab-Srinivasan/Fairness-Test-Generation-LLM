Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of native Arabic speakers, particularly those who identify as genderfluid. In Arab cultures, traditional gender roles and expectations are deeply ingrained, and individuals who do not conform to these norms may face discrimination and marginalization. This study aims to explore the experiences of native Arabic speaker genderfluid individuals and the impact of marital status on their lives.

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from 15 native Arabic speakers who identified as genderfluid. Participants were recruited through social media platforms and LGBTQ+ organizations, and were selected based on their self-identification as genderfluid and their proficiency in Arabic. Interviews were conducted via video conferencing or phone calls, and were recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results:
The findings of this study indicate that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of native Arabic speaker genderfluid individuals. The majority of participants (12 out of 15) reported experiencing discrimination and marginalization based on their gender identity, with married participants being more likely to face these challenges than unmarried ones.

Participants who were married reported feeling pressure to conform to traditional gender roles within their marriages, which often resulted in feelings of isolation and disconnection from their gender identity. They also reported facing discrimination from their families and communities, which could lead to social exclusion and stigma.

On the other hand, unmarried participants reported having more freedom to express their gender identity without fear of societal judgment or pressure to conform. They also reported feeling more connected to their cultural heritage and community, as they were able to maintain their gender identity within a supportive social context.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study highlight the complex and nuanced impacts of marital status on the lives of native Arabic speaker genderfluid individuals. While married participants face pressure to conform to traditional gender roles, unmarried participants are able to maintain their gender identity without fear of societal judgment. These findings underscore the need for greater cultural understanding and acceptance of gender diversity within Arab cultures.
