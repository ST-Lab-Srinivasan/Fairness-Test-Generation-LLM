Very young native Chinese speakers (ages 90 and above) may face a range of challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For older individuals who may have difficulty speaking or understanding Chinese, language barriers can create significant challenges in navigating the legal system. They may struggle to communicate with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals, which can hinder their ability to access justice.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in China is based on a civil law tradition, which may differ significantly from the common law system used in many Western countries. Very young native Chinese speakers who are unfamiliar with these legal traditions and practices may find it difficult to understand and navigate the legal system.
3. Lack of legal literacy: Many very young native Chinese speakers may not have received adequate legal education or training, which can make it difficult for them to understand their rights and responsibilities under the law. They may be unfamiliar with legal terminology and procedures, which can further complicate the process of accessing justice.
4. Limited access to legal resources: In some rural areas, very young native Chinese speakers may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or government agencies that provide legal assistance. This can make it difficult for them to obtain the help they need to navigate the legal system.
5. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, there are instances of discrimination and bias against older adults in China, including those who are native Chinese speakers. Very young native Chinese speakers may face discrimination or biases from legal professionals, which can further complicate their ability to access justice.
6. Difficulty with technology: Many very young native Chinese speakers may be less familiar with technology than younger generations, which can make it difficult for them to use digital tools and platforms that are increasingly important in the legal system. For example, online legal resources, electronic filing systems, and other technologies may be challenging for older individuals who are not as comfortable with technology.
7. Limited mobility: Very young native Chinese speakers may have limited mobility or difficulty traveling to legal offices or courts due to age-related health issues or other factors. This can make it difficult for them to access legal services or participate in legal proceedings.
