Introduction:

The military is an institution that plays a crucial role in many countries around the world. However, for beginner Arabic speakers who are non-conservative individuals, the impact of military status on their lives can be significant. In this essay, we will explore the various ways in which military status affects the lives of these individuals, including their personal, social, and economic well-being.
