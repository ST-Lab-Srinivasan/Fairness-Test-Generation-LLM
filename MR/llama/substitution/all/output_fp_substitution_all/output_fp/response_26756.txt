However, I understand that you may be asking about the challenges faced by older adults (ages 90 and above) in the legal system. Here are some common challenges that older adults may encounter:

1. Cognitive decline: Older adults may experience cognitive decline, which can affect their ability to understand legal concepts, remember important details, or make informed decisions about their legal matters.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Older adults may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or online legal information due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or other factors.
3. Discrimination: Older adults may face discrimination in the legal system based on their age, race, ethnicity, or other factors. This can result in unequal treatment under the law and a lack of access to justice.
4. Lack of representation: Older adults may have difficulty finding legal representation due to the high cost of hiring a lawyer or the lack of availability of free or low-cost legal services.
5. Complex legal issues: Older adults may face complex legal issues such as estate planning, probate, or elder abuse, which can be challenging to navigate without proper legal guidance.
6. Limited understanding of legal terminology: Older adults may have difficulty understanding legal terminology and procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system without assistance.
7. Difficulty communicating with legal professionals: Older adults may have difficulty communicating with lawyers or other legal professionals due to hearing or speech difficulties, cognitive decline, or other factors.
8. Limited mobility: Older adults may have limited mobility or transportation options, which can make it difficult for them to access legal services or appear in court.
9. Cultural and linguistic barriers: Older adults from diverse cultural backgrounds may face language barriers or cultural differences that can affect their ability to navigate the legal system.
