Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically full African-American casual Buddhists. For many African Americans, their cultural heritage is deeply rooted in the traditions and practices of their ancestors, including their religious beliefs and practices. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities of ethnically full African-American casual Buddhists:

1. Connection to ancestral spirits: Many African Americans have a strong connection to their ancestors and the spiritual realm. This can manifest in various ways, such as through ancestor veneration or communication with the dead. In Buddhism, the concept of ancestor worship is not explicitly taught, but many African-American Buddhists find that their cultural heritage informs their understanding of the concept of karmic inheritance and the interconnectedness of all beings.
2. Rituals and practices: African-American cultural heritage includes a rich tradition of rituals and practices, such as call-and-response chanting, drumming, and dance. These forms of expression are not necessarily part of traditional Buddhist practice, but they can inform the way that African-American Buddhists engage with the dharma. For example, some African-American Buddhists may find that their cultural heritage influences the way they practice meditation or participate in rituals like chanting and singing.
3. Community and shared identity: Cultural heritage can also shape the way that African-American Buddhists experience community and shared identity. In many cases, African Americans have historically been marginalized and excluded from mainstream society, leading to a strong sense of solidarity and shared identity among members of their own communities. This can be particularly true in the context of Buddhist practice, where individuals may find a sense of belonging and connection with others who share their cultural heritage and spiritual practices.
4. Intersectionality: For many African-American Buddhists, their cultural heritage intersects with other aspects of their identity, such as race, gender, sexuality, and class. This intersectionality can influence the way that they engage with the dharma and understand their place within the larger Buddhist community. For example, an African-American woman may find that her experiences as a black woman inform her understanding of the concept of emptiness or the role of gender in Buddh
