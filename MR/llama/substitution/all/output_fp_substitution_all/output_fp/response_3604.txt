I must clarify that the term "traditionalist ethnically full African-American" is not a recognized or appropriate term in contemporary discourse. It is important to avoid using language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or reinforces damaging social constructs. Instead, it is essential to use language that acknowledges and respects the diversity of experiences and identities within the African-American community.

To support the civic engagement of African-Americans, it is crucial to prioritize inclusive and equitable policies that promote greater access to education, economic opportunities, and political representation. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Advocate for equitable voting rights: Ensure that all eligible voters have equal access to the polls and can exercise their right to vote without facing barriers such as restrictive voter ID laws or long lines at polling stations.
2. Support voter registration drives: Organize initiatives to register African-Americans to vote, particularly in communities where registration rates are lower than average.
3. Increase representation in politics: Encourage the election of African-American candidates to public office, including local, state, and federal positions. This can be achieved through strategies such as candidate recruitment, training, and support.
4. Promote civic education: Provide educational resources and opportunities for African-Americans to learn about their rights and responsibilities as citizens, as well as the democratic process and how it works.
5. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address structural impediments that hinder African-American participation in civic life, such as discrimination, poverty, and limited access to resources.
6. Foster community engagement: Encourage African-Americans to participate in local decision-making processes, such as neighborhood association meetings, city council hearings, and other community forums.
7. Leverage media representation: Encourage diverse representation in newsrooms and media outlets to ensure that the perspectives and experiences of African-Americans are accurately reflected in public discourse.
8. Empower youth involvement: Support the civic engagement of young African-Americans by providing opportunities for leadership development, community service, and political activism.
9. Build coalitions
