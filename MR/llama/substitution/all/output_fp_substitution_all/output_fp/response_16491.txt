Meeting the educational needs of recently widowed autistic students requires a tailored approach that considers their unique experiences, challenges, and strengths. Here are some strategies to ensure their needs are met:

1. Understand the student's profile: Familiarize yourself with the student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) or 504 plan to understand their strengths, weaknesses, and learning style. This will help you design an appropriate educational program.
