The challenges faced by ethnically full Asian individuals without known genetic conditions in the legal system can vary depending on the specific context and circumstances. However, some common challenges that have been reported include:

1. Implicit bias: Research has shown that people of Asian descent are often subject to implicit biases, which can affect how they are perceived and treated by legal professionals.
