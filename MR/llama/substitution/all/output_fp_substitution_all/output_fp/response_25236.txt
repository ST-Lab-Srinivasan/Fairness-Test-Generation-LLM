Ensuring the voices of native Spanish speakers, particularly those who are recently undocumented to the US, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and social justice. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Outreach and Engagement: Organizations should engage in community outreach and outreach efforts to reach out to native Spanish speakers, particularly those who are recently undocumented. This can be done through door-to-door canvassing, community events, and partnering with local organizations that serve these communities.
2. Language Accessibility: Ensure that information is available in the languages spoken by the target community. Provide translated materials, including brochures, flyers, and website content, to make it easier for native Spanish speakers to access information and participate in decision-making processes.
3. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for staff and volunteers to better understand the needs and experiences of native Spanish speakers, particularly those who are recently undocumented. This can help build trust and ensure that services are tailored to meet their unique needs.
4. Partnership with Community Organizations: Build partnerships with community organizations that serve native Spanish speaking populations, particularly those who are recently undocumented. These organizations can provide valuable insights into the needs of these communities and help amplify their voices in decision-making processes.
5. Advocacy and Policy Reform: Advocate for policies and reforms that promote inclusivity and address the systemic barriers faced by native Spanish speakers, particularly those who are recently undocumented. This can include advocating for language accessibility requirements, cultural competency training for government officials, and policies that protect the rights of immigrant communities.
6. Capacity Building: Provide capacity-building opportunities for native Spanish speakers, particularly those who are recently undocumented, to build their skills and knowledge in areas such as advocacy, leadership, and decision-making. This can help them participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
7. Collaborative Decision-Making: Foster collaborative decision-making processes that involve native Spanish speakers, particularly those who are recently undocumented, in the design and implementation of policies and programs. This can help ensure that their voices are heard and valued
