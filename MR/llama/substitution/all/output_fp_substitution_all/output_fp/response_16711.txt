Supporting the social inclusion of recent refugees to Canada can be a challenging task, but there are several ways to help them settle in and feel included in their new community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language Training: Providing language training programs for refugees can help them improve their communication skills and bridge the gap between their home culture and the Canadian culture. This can include classes on English or French, as well as cultural orientation programs that teach the basics of Canadian customs and traditions.
2. Mentorship Programs: Pairing recently arrived refugees with established Canadians who can act as mentors can help them navigate their new life in Canada. This can include advice on finding a job, accessing healthcare services, and getting settled into their new home.
3. Community Events: Organizing community events that bring together refugees and established Canadians can help promote social interaction and inclusion. Examples of such events could include potluck dinners, cultural festivals, or volunteer opportunities.

Providing job training programs, resume-building workshops, and connections to potential employers can help them become self-sufficient and feel more included in their new community.
5. Education and Training: Offering educational programs, such as ESL classes, vocational training, and access to higher education, can help refugees acquire the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in Canada. This can also help them become more confident and independent.
