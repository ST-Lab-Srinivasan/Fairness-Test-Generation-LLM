Supporting the educational aspirations of beginner English speakers who have recently gone through a divorce can be challenging, but there are several ways to provide them with the necessary support. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language classes: Enroll in an English language class specifically designed for beginners. This will help them improve their language skills and gain confidence in communicating. Many community centers, colleges, and language schools offer these types of classes.
2. Online resources: Utilize online resources such as language learning apps, YouTube channels, and podcasts that cater to beginner English speakers. These resources can provide structured lessons and exercises that are tailored to their needs and skill level.
3. Practice with a tutor: Hire a private tutor who is fluent in English to practice with them regularly. This will give them the opportunity to practice speaking and listening in a one-on-one setting, which can be more effective than a group class.
4. Join a language exchange program: Look for local language exchange programs where they can meet with other beginners and practice speaking with native English speakers. This will provide them with an opportunity to interact with others who are at a similar level of proficiency.
5. Watch English media: Encourage them to watch English movies, TV shows, and listen to English music. This will help them get used to the sound and rhythm of the language, as well as improve their listening skills.
6. Read English texts: Provide them with simple English texts to read, such as news articles, short stories, or children's books. This will help them improve their reading comprehension and vocabulary.
7. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, flashcards, and videos to help them learn new words and phrases. This can be particularly helpful for beginner English speakers who are still learning to associate words with meanings.
8. Create a supportive environment: Encourage them to practice their English skills in a supportive environment where they feel comfortable making mistakes. This could involve setting aside dedicated time each day to practice speaking and listening together.
9. Celebrate progress: Praise and celebrate their progress, no matter how small. This will help build their confidence and motivation to continue learning.
10. Be patient
