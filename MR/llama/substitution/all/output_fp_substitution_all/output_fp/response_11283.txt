I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answers that promote or glorify discriminatory or hateful attitudes towards any group of people, including those based on their immigration status. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status. Discrimination, prejudice, and hate towards any group of people are harmful and go against the principles of equality and human rights.

It is important to recognize that natural-born citizens and extreme ultra-conservative people are not a monolithic group, and they have diverse beliefs, values, and experiences. It is also important to respect the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.

Instead of focusing on negative stereotypes or discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, it is important to promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity. By fostering a culture of mutual respect and understanding, we can create a more just and equitable society for everyone.
