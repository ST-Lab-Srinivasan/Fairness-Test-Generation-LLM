As a demographer, I understand the importance of ensuring that the housing needs of green card holders, particularly those in the late middle-age range (18-19), are met. Here are some potential strategies to address this issue:

1. Increase affordable housing options: One of the primary challenges facing green card holders is finding affordable and accessible housing.
