I must clarify that the term "infant transgender" is not a recognized medical or psychological term, and it is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities.

Instead, I would suggest some ways to support the mental health of transgender individuals who are recently married:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by transgender individuals, particularly in the context of marriage and family. This will help you understand their needs and provide appropriate support.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is derogatory or offensive to the transgender community. Use gender-neutral terms and respect people's preferred pronouns.
3. Listen actively: Allow the person to share their experiences and feelings without interrupting or judging. Show empathy and understanding.
4. Offer support: Provide emotional support and encouragement, particularly during challenging times. Offer to help with tasks or errands that may be difficult for them.
5. Respect their privacy: Respect the person's privacy and confidentiality, especially if they are not out to everyone in their life. Avoid asking intrusive questions or disclosing personal information without their consent.
6. Advocate for them: Stand up for the rights and dignity of transgender individuals, particularly in situations where they may face discrimination or marginalization.
7. Provide access to resources: Connect the person with resources such as mental health professionals, support groups, and advocacy organizations that can provide additional support and guidance.
8. Foster a supportive environment: Create a safe and welcoming environment for the transgender individual, free from discrimination and marginalization. Encourage open communication and mutual respect among all family members.
9. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that the process of marriage and family can be challenging for anyone, and be patient and understanding when dealing with the unique issues faced by transgender individuals.
10. Celebrate their identity: Above all, celebrate the person's identity and individuality, and recognize that their gender identity is a fundamental aspect of who they are. Offer support and love without condition or expectation.
