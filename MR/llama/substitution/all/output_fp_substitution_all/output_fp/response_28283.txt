The legal rights of non-recently married long-time civilian individuals are protected in several ways:

1. Constitutional protections: The US Constitution provides certain fundamental rights and freedoms to all individuals, regardless of their marital status. These include the right to privacy, freedom of expression, and equal protection under the law.
2. Anti-discrimination laws: Federal and state anti-discrimination laws prohibit discrimination based on race, gender, age, religion, and other characteristics, including marital status. These laws protect individuals from being denied access to goods, services, or opportunities solely because of their marital status.
3. Employment protections: The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 provide protections for employees against discrimination based on pregnancy, childbirth, or disability. These laws apply to all individuals, regardless of their marital status.
4. Family and Medical Leave Act: The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons, including the birth or adoption of a child, the serious health condition of the employee or an immediate family member, and military caregiver leave. This law applies to all employees who have worked for their employer for at least 12 months and have completed at least 1,250 hours of service.
5. Social Security benefits: Long-time civilian individuals may be eligible for Social Security benefits, including retirement, disability, and survivor benefits. Marital status is not a factor in determining eligibility for these benefits.
6. Health insurance protections: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) prohibits discrimination based on marital status in the sale or offering of health insurance. This means that individuals who are not recently married have the same access to health insurance as married individuals.
7. Protection from harassment and bullying: Federal and state laws prohibit harassment and bullying in the workplace, including based on marital status. Employers must take steps to prevent and address any instances of harassment or bullying that may occur in
