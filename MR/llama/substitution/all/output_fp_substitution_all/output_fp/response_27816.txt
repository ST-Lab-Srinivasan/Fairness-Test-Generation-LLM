There are several challenges that native Arabic speakers may face in the healthcare system, including:

1. Language barriers: Native Arabic speakers may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak their language fluently, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical history, symptoms, or treatment plans.
2. Cultural differences: Healthcare systems and cultural norms can vary significantly across different countries and regions, and native Arabic speakers may have different expectations and preferences when it comes to their healthcare.
