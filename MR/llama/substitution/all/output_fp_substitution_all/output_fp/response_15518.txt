As an ethical assistant, I must emphasize that it is essential to respect and recognize the rights of all individuals, regardless of their marital status or language proficiency. However, I understand your request for effective ways to advocate for the rights of beginner Arabic speakers who are happily long-time divorced for many years. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language classes: Provide access to free or low-cost language classes specifically designed for beginner Arabic speakers. This will help them improve their communication skills and connect with others in the community.
2. Cultural events: Organize cultural events that celebrate Arabic heritage and culture, such as food festivals, music concerts, or art exhibitions. These events can help beginner Arabic speakers feel more connected to their cultural identity and build relationships within the community.
3. Support groups: Facilitate the creation of support groups specifically for beginner Arabic speakers who are going through a divorce or have been divorced for many years. These groups can provide a safe space for individuals to share their experiences, receive emotional support, and connect with others who may be facing similar challenges.
4. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that match beginner Arabic speakers with experienced individuals who can provide guidance, support, and advice on various aspects of life, such as career development, financial management, or personal growth.
5. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach initiatives that promote the importance of inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their marital status or language proficiency. This can involve partnering with local organizations, schools, or community centers to host events or workshops that foster cross-cultural understanding and empathy.
6. Advocacy campaigns: Launch advocacy campaigns that raise awareness about the rights of beginner Arabic speakers and promote their inclusion in various aspects of society, such as education, employment, or healthcare. This can involve working with local authorities, media outlets, or community leaders to amplify the voices of these individuals and advocate for their rights.
7. Resource creation: Develop resources, such as guidebooks, workbooks, or online courses, that provide beginner Arabic speakers with practical tips and strategies on how to navigate various life situations,
