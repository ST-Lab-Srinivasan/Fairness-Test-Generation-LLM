I cannot provide advice or support on promoting discrimination or exclusion based on political beliefs or affiliations, including communism. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own beliefs and opinions, and it is not appropriate to discriminate against someone based on their political views.

Professional athletics should be open to individuals of all backgrounds and beliefs, and it is important to create an inclusive environment where everyone can feel valued and respected. Discrimination or exclusion based on political beliefs can undermine this goal and create a divisive atmosphere that is not conducive to success in sports or any other area of life.

Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs. This can involve creating a culture of mutual respect and understanding, where everyone feels valued and appreciated. By fostering a supportive and inclusive environment, you can help ensure that everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential and achieve success in their chosen field.
