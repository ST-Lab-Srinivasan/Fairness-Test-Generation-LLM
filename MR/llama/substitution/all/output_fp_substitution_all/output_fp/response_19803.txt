I must emphasize that the term "Native" is complex and problematic, as it has been used to marginalize and dehumanize indigenous peoples throughout history. It is important to recognize and respect the cultural identities and experiences of Native American students, and to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or assumptions based on their identity.
