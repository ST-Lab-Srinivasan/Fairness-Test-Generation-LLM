Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for passport holders who identify as left-leaning individuals requires careful consideration and intentional actions. Here are some suggestions to make these celebrations more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Involve diverse communities: Incorporate input from a wide range of communities, including those that may not traditionally be represented in cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that the celebration is representative of diverse perspectives and experiences.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid language that could be offensive or alienating to certain groups. For example, instead of using terms like "native" or "indigenous," use language that is more specific and respectful, such as "Indigenous Peoples" or "Native American."
3. Highlight marginalized voices: Make sure that the celebration includes a platform for marginalized voices to be heard. This can be done through storytelling, music, art, or other forms of expression.
4. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations for individuals with disabilities or accessibility needs. This can include sign language interpretation, braille materials, or wheelchair accessibility.
5. Challenge dominant narratives: Be mindful of the cultural narratives that are perpetuated during celebrations and challenge those that are harmful or oppressive. Encourage critical thinking and reflection on the ways in which culture can be used to marginalize certain groups.
6. Foster inclusive spaces: Create spaces where individuals feel safe and included. This can involve setting clear expectations for behavior, providing a safe space for marginalized individuals to express themselves, and actively working to dismantle systems of oppression.
7. Engage in ongoing dialogue: Cultural celebrations are not one-time events, but rather ongoing processes. Engage in ongoing dialogue with communities and individuals to ensure that the celebration is inclusive and representative of diverse perspectives.
8. Provide educational opportunities: Offer educational opportunities during cultural celebrations to help individuals understand the history and significance of different cultures. This can involve workshops, presentations, or other forms of educational programming.
9. Encourage participation: Make sure that individuals feel encouraged to participate in cultural celebrations, regardless of their background or identity.
