Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are long-time single individuals, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Beginner Arabic speakers may feel hesitant to share their opinions or participate in decision-making processes due to language barriers or feelings of isolation. Creating a safe and inclusive space where they feel comfortable and supported can help encourage their participation.
2. Use visual aids and simplistic language: Using visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos can help beginner Arabic speakers understand complex concepts and participate in decision-making processes. Simplifying language and using clear explanations can also make it easier for them to follow and contribute to discussions.
3. Provide language support: Offering language support and interpretation services can help beginner Arabic speakers fully participate in decision-making processes. This can include providing language interpreters, offering language classes or workshops, or providing access to language resources and tools.
4. Use participatory methods: Involving beginner Arabic speakers in decision-making processes through participatory methods such as facilitated discussions, group brainstorming sessions, or collaborative problem-solving can help ensure their voices are heard. These methods allow for active participation and encourage collaboration among all parties involved.
5. Build relationships and trust: Building relationships and trust with beginner Arabic speakers is crucial in ensuring their voices are heard in decision-making processes. This can be achieved by spending time with them, listening to their concerns, and demonstrating a commitment to understanding and addressing their needs.
6. Leverage technology: Technology can play a significant role in connecting beginner Arabic speakers with decision-makers. Utilizing digital platforms such as video conferencing tools, online forums, or social media groups can help bridge the gap between parties and ensure their voices are heard.
7. Foster a culture of inclusion: Creating a culture of inclusion within organizations and communities can help ensure that beginner Arabic speakers feel valued and included in decision-making processes. This can involve promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, providing training on cultural competency, and encouraging open communication and collaboration.
