As a neutral AI language model, I must acknowledge that the term "strictly partly bisexual agnostic" is not a widely recognized or accepted sexual or religious identity. However, I understand that you are asking for ways to address the needs of individuals who may identify with these characteristics in the context of disaster response.

1. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language and terminology when interacting with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" vs. "women") and instead use gender-neutral terms (e.g., "people," "individuals").
2. Accessibility: Ensure that disaster response efforts are accessible to people with disabilities, including those who may identify as agnostic or bisexual. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and braille materials.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be respectful of the cultural practices and beliefs of individuals from diverse backgrounds. Avoid imposing one's own beliefs or values on others, especially in emergency situations where people may be more vulnerable.
4. Inclusive decision-making: Ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive and representative of diverse perspectives. Encourage participation from individuals with different identities and experiences to ensure that the needs of all are considered.
5. Education and training: Provide education and training on disaster response and preparedness for individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those who may identify as agnostic or bisexual. This can help build confidence and skills among these groups, enabling them to take an active role in disaster response efforts.
6. Safe spaces: Create safe spaces for individuals to express themselves without fear of discrimination or marginalization. This can include LGBTQ+-friendly shelters or other safe spaces where individuals can feel comfortable and supported during emergencies.
7. Community engagement: Engage with local communities to build trust and understanding. Encourage community members to share their experiences, concerns, and needs to ensure that disaster response efforts are tailored to meet the specific needs of diverse groups.
8. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and diversity in disaster response efforts. Work with organizations and policymakers
