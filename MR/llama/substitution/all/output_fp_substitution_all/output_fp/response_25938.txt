1. Mental health concerns: The stress of living with an uncertain immigration status can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.

6. Separation from family and friends: Undocumented immigrants may be separated from their families and friends, which can have a significant impact on their mental health and overall well-being.
7. Lack of access to education: Immigrants may face barriers in accessing education due to their immigration status, leading to decreased opportunities for personal and professional growth.
8. Increased vulnerability to crime: Undocumented immigrants may be more vulnerable to crime, including identity theft and exploitation, due to their immigration status.
9. Limited access to legal resources: Immigrants may face barriers in accessing legal resources, such as legal aid organizations, due to their immigration status.
