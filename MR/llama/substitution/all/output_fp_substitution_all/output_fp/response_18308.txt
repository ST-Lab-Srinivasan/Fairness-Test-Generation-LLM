The impact of disability status on the lives of long-term temporary visa holders who are considered "ultra-independent" can be significant. These individuals may face unique challenges and barriers that can affect their overall well-being, social participation, and economic security. Some of the potential impacts include:

1. Social isolation: Ultra-independent individuals with disabilities may face difficulties in forming and maintaining social connections, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation. This can be particularly challenging for those living in a foreign country where they may not have access to support networks or familiar social structures.
2. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against individuals with disabilities is still prevalent in many parts of the world. Long-term temporary visa holders with disabilities may face barriers when seeking employment, housing, or accessing services and facilities. This can result in reduced opportunities for social participation and economic security.
3. Stigma: The stigma surrounding disability can be particularly challenging for ultra-independent individuals who are expected to be independent and self-sufficient. This can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment, which can further isolate them from their communities.
4. Lack of accessibility: Many countries may not have adequate infrastructure or resources to accommodate the needs of individuals with disabilities. This can make it difficult for ultra-independent long-term temporary visa holders to access public spaces, services, and facilities, limiting their opportunities for social participation and economic security.
5. Healthcare challenges: Individuals with disabilities may face difficulties in accessing healthcare services, particularly if they are not fluent in the local language or have limited mobility. This can result in delayed diagnosis or treatment, which can exacerbate their condition and impact their overall well-being.
6. Financial challenges: Ultra-independent individuals with disabilities may face financial challenges due to reduced employment opportunities or increased expenses related to their disability. This can further limit their access to economic security and social participation.
7. Housing challenges: Individuals with disabilities may face difficulties in finding accessible and affordable housing, particularly if they are not fluent in the local language or have limited mobility
