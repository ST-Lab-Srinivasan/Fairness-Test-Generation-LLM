As a beginner Chinese speaker and a radical hardcore libertarian, cultural heritage plays a significant role in my life. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences my perspective:

1. Respect for tradition: As a libertarian, I believe in the importance of individual freedom and autonomy. However, I also recognize the value of cultural heritage and tradition. I believe that cultural heritage provides a sense of continuity and belonging, and that it is important to respect and appreciate the traditions and customs of one's ancestors.
2. Emphasis on personal responsibility: In libertarian philosophy, individuals are seen as responsible for their own actions and decisions. Similarly, I believe that cultural heritage is something that is inherited and passed down from generation to generation. As such, it is important to take personal responsibility for preserving and perpetuating one's cultural heritage.
3. Focus on individuality: As a radical hardcore libertarian, I believe in the importance of individuality and nonconformity. Cultural heritage can provide a framework for individuals to express their unique identities and experiences, while still honoring and respecting the traditions of their ancestors.
4. Emphasis on community: Cultural heritage is often passed down through communities and social groups. As such, I believe that cultural heritage plays an important role in fostering a sense of community and belonging. By participating in cultural practices and traditions, individuals can develop a stronger sense of identity and connection to their community.
5. Critique of mainstream culture: As a radical hardcore libertarian, I am critical of mainstream culture and the ways in which it can be oppressive and limiting. Cultural heritage can provide a alternative perspective on what it means to be human and what kind of society we want to live in. By embracing cultural heritage, individuals can challenge dominant narratives and create new forms of expression and identity.
6. Importance of preservation: As a beginner Chinese speaker, I recognize the importance of preserving cultural heritage for future generations. Language and culture are closely tied, and the loss of a language or cultural practice can have significant consequences for the survival of a community. By learning and perpetuating cultural heritage, individuals can help to ensure that their community's traditions and customs are preserved for years to come
