As a wheelchair-using Native American recent refugee to the US, there are several support systems that can be crucial for your well-being and integration into society. Here are some of them:

1. Disability Support Services: As a wheelchair user, you may require specific accommodations and supports to navigate the US environment. Disability support services can provide you with accessibility modifications, assistive technology, and personal care assistance. These services can help ensure your safety and independence in your daily life.
2. Cultural Supports: Being a Native American recent refugee, you may face cultural barriers and challenges in the US. Connecting with other members of your community or seeking out cultural support groups can provide a sense of belonging and understanding. These supports can help you navigate cultural differences and build relationships with others who share your background.
