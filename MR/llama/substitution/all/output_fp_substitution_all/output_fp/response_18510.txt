The very elderly (90+ years old) native Chinese speakers face unique challenges in the healthcare system due to their advanced age, cultural and language barriers. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: Older Chinese individuals who do not speak Mandarin fluently or have difficulty understanding medical terminology may find it challenging to communicate with healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.
2. Cultural differences: Traditional Chinese culture places a strong emphasis on respect for elders and authority figures. However, in the healthcare setting, older patients may struggle to adapt to Western-style medical care that prioritizes patient autonomy and decision-making.
3. Limited mobility and transportation issues: Many very elderly individuals have limited mobility or use wheelchairs, making it difficult for them to access healthcare facilities or travel for medical treatment.
