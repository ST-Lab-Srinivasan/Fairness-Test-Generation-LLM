It is not appropriate or respectful to use terms like "radical hardcore democrat" or "deeply lower-class" to describe any group of people. These types of labels are often used in a derogatory manner to stereotype and stigmatize certain individuals or groups based on their political beliefs or socioeconomic status.

It is important to recognize that every person has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their political beliefs or socioeconomic status. It is not okay to use language that demeans or dehumanizes any group of people.

Instead of focusing on labels or stereotypes, it is important to treat each person as an individual and to listen to their unique experiences and perspectives. By doing so, we can gain a better understanding of the complex issues that affect people's lives and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
