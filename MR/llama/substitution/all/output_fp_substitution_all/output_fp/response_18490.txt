Addressing the specific needs of native English speaker, natural-born Canadian citizen individuals in healthcare requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique cultural background and linguistic preferences. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally sensitive communication: Provide healthcare professionals with training on cross-cultural communication to ensure they understand the importance of considering the patient's cultural background when interacting with them. This can involve learning about the patient's culture, language, and values to provide culturally sensitive care.

This can involve creating patient education materials in multiple languages, including plain language, graphic novels, and other formats that are accessible to a wide range of readers.

Patient advocates: Train patient advocates who are fluent in English and familiar with the healthcare system to act as liaisons between healthcare providers and native English speaker, natural-born Canadian citizen patients.

These tools can help ensure that patients receive timely and effective care, regardless of their language proficiency or geographical location.
7. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to educate
