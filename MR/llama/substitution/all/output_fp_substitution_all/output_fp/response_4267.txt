Creating more inclusive social policies for beginner Arabic speakers, including cisgender individuals, requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive language policies: Develop language policies that recognize and respect the diversity of gender identities and expressions. Use inclusive language in all official documents, signage, and communication materials. Provide training for employees and volunteers on using inclusive language and respecting people's preferred pronouns.
2. Accessibility and accommodations: Ensure that public spaces and events are accessible to people of all gender identities and abilities. Provide gender-neutral restrooms, and make sure that events are wheelchair-accessible with appropriate seating and accommodations for attendees with disabilities.
3. Education and awareness: Offer training and workshops on gender diversity, inclusivity, and respect for all gender identities. Encourage employees and volunteers to be mindful of their language and behavior around beginners Arabic speakers, particularly those who may be non-binary or genderqueer.
4. Safe spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for beginner Arabic speakers to learn and practice their language, free from discrimination and harassment. Ensure that these spaces are accessible and welcoming to all, regardless of gender identity or expression.
5. Curriculum development: Develop and implement a curriculum that includes materials reflecting the diversity of gender identities and expressions. Use inclusive language and imagery in textbooks, workbooks, and other learning materials. Encourage discussion and exploration of gender themes and issues in a respectful and safe environment.
6. Partnership with LGBTQ+ organizations: Collaborate with local LGBTQ+ organizations to promote inclusivity and support for beginner Arabic speakers who may be part of the LGBTQ+ community. Work together to develop policies, programs, and events that are welcoming and inclusive of all gender identities.
7. Community engagement: Engage with the local Arabic-speaking community to understand their needs and preferences regarding gender identity and expression. Involve them in the development of policies and programs that promote inclusivity and respect for all gender identities.
8. Focus on intersectionality:
