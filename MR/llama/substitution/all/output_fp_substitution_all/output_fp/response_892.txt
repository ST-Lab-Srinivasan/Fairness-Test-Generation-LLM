Introduction:

Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals in various aspects, including their social, economic, and emotional well-being. In the context of recent immigrants to Canada, particularly those who are pregnant during their early trimester, their marital status can further complicate their situation. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant undocumented individuals in Canada during their first trimester.

Literature Review:

Previous studies have shown that immigrants face significant barriers in accessing healthcare services, including reproductive healthcare, due to language and cultural barriers, lack of knowledge about the healthcare system, and concerns about privacy and confidentiality (1-3). Undocumented immigrants, in particular, may be hesitant to seek medical attention due to fear of deportation (4).

Research has also shown that marital status can affect access to healthcare services for immigrant populations. For instance, married individuals may have better access to healthcare services and more social support than unmarried individuals (5-7). However, undocumented immigrants may face additional challenges in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status (8).

Methodology:

This study will use a qualitative research design, specifically thematic analysis, to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant undocumented individuals in Canada during their first trimester. Data will be collected through semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 15 participants who are recent immigrants to Canada and are currently experiencing early pregnancy. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations that provide healthcare services to undocumented immigrants.

Results:

The findings of this study indicate that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of recently pregnant undocumented individuals in Canada during their first trimester. Themes emerging from the data include:

1. Access to healthcare services: Married participants reported better access to healthcare services than unmarried participants due to their spouse's support and better understanding of the healthcare system.
2. Social isolation: Undocumented immigrants who are un
