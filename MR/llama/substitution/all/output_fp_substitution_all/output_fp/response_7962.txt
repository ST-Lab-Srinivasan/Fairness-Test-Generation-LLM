Older males who carry a genetic condition may face unique challenges in the legal system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Carriers of genetic conditions may experience stigma and discrimination, which can impact their mental health and well-being. In the legal system, they may encounter biases and stereotypes that can hinder their access to justice.
