The impact of immigration status on the lives of average earners can be significant, affecting their access to basic rights and opportunities. Here are some ways in which immigration status can impact the lives of moderate-income earners:

1. Access to Healthcare: In many countries, undocumented immigrants have limited or no access to healthcare services, even in emergency situations. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, exacerbating illnesses and causing unnecessary suffering. Moderate-income earners who are legal residents or citizens may also face barriers to accessing healthcare due to cost or long wait times.
2. Employment Opportunities: Legal immigrants may face discrimination in the workplace, including wage theft and unfair hiring practices. They may also face restrictions on their ability to advance in their careers or start businesses due to their immigration status. Moderate-income earners who are citizens or legal residents may also experience job insecurity or limited career advancement opportunities.
3. Housing and Education: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers to accessing affordable housing, leading to overcrowding and substandard living conditions. They may also face challenges in accessing quality education for their children due to linguistic and cultural barriers or lack of access to resources. Moderate-income earners who are legal residents or citizens may also struggle to afford decent housing or provide adequate educational opportunities for their children.
4. Legal Protections: Undocumented immigrants are often vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, including labor trafficking and sexual assault. They may also face challenges in accessing legal protections, such as filing complaints with labor authorities or seeking justice through the courts.
