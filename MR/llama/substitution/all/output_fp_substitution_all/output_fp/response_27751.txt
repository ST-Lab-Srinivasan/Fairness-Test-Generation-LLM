Familiarizing yourself with the laws governing these benefits can help you ensure that your clients are taking advantage of all the resources available to them.
4. Be Aware of Deployment-Related Issues: Military deployments can create unique legal challenges for service members and their families. It's essential to be aware of these issues, including the impact of deployment on custody and visitation rights, as well as the potential for military divorce.
5. Collaborate with Other Professionals: Legal matters involving active-duty individuals often involve complex issues that require collaboration with other professionals, such as financial advisors, mental health providers, and veterans' service organizations. Building relationships with these professionals can help ensure that your clients receive comprehensive support and guidance.
6. Stay Informed about Military Legal Developments: The military legal system is constantly evolving, and it's essential to stay informed about new developments and changes in the law. This can help you provide more effective representation for your clients.
