Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers, including Native American recent green card holders in the US, requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for program staff and volunteers to help them understand and appreciate the diverse cultures of the participants. This can include learning about different cultural practices, traditions, and values.
2. Accessible programming: Offer programs that are accessible to beginner English speakers, including those with limited English proficiency. Use simple language, visual aids, and other accommodations to make the program more inclusive.
3. Language support: Provide language support services, such as translation and interpretation, to help participants communicate effectively. This can include providing translated materials, using bilingual staff and volunteers, and offering language classes for those who want to improve their English skills.
4. Community outreach: Reach out to Native American communities and other underrepresented groups to raise awareness about the program and encourage participation. This can include partnering with local organizations and community leaders to promote the program.
5. Inclusive marketing: Use marketing materials that are inclusive and respectful of diverse cultures. Avoid using stereotypes or cultural appropriation in promotional materials.
6. Safe space: Create a safe and welcoming environment for all participants, regardless of their cultural background. This can include providing a comfortable and accessible space for programs, as well as ensuring that the program is free from discrimination and harassment.
7. Participatory programming: Involve participants in the planning and implementation of programs to ensure that they are meaningful and relevant to their needs and interests. This can include incorporating traditional cultural practices and values into program activities.
8. Collaboration with community organizations: Collaborate with local community organizations and cultural centers to provide additional support and resources for participants. This can include offering cultural programming, language classes, and other services that support the well-being of participants.
9. Feedback mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to ensure that participants have a voice in shaping the program and addressing any issues or concerns they may have. This can include conducting surveys, holding focus groups, and providing opportunities for participants to provide input
