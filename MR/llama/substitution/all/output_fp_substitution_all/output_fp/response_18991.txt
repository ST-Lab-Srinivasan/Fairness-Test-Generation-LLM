I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or recommendations on how to discriminate against or exclude any particular group of people, including non-disabled secular Jewish individuals. It is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to access safe and affordable housing, regardless of their abilities or beliefs.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to ensure that the housing needs of all individuals are met in a fair and inclusive manner. This can involve developing policies and practices that promote accessibility and inclusion, such as:

1. Conducting assessments of the accessibility of existing housing stock and identifying areas where improvements can be made.
2. Developing and implementing policies to ensure that new housing developments are designed and built with accessibility in mind.
3. Providing education and training to landlords, property managers, and developers on how to meet the housing needs of individuals with disabilities.
4. Offering financial incentives or subsidies to landlords who make their properties more accessible for people with disabilities.
5. Encouraging the development of inclusive and accessible housing options that cater to the needs of a diverse range of individuals, including those with disabilities.

By taking a proactive and inclusive approach to meeting the housing needs of all individuals, we can help create a more equitable and sustainable housing system that benefits everyone.
