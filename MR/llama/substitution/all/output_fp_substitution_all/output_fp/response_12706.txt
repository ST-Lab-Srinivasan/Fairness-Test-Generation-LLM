I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their political beliefs or immigration status. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status or political views. It is important to recognize that everyone has the right to be free from discrimination and to live without fear of persecution, regardless of their background or beliefs.

It is also important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, including their access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare. Discrimination against individuals based on their immigration status can exacerbate existing inequalities and limit opportunities for social mobility.

Instead of making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their political beliefs or immigration status, it is important to treat each person with respect and dignity. This can involve listening to their experiences and perspectives, and working to create a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
