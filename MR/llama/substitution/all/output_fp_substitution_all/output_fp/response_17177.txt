Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of green card holders who are also natural-born US citizens, particularly if they are cisgender. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to healthcare: As green card holders, individuals may face barriers in accessing affordable and quality healthcare, including those with genetic conditions. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, which can worsen the condition's impact on their lives.
2. Employment discrimination: Individuals with genetic conditions may face employment discrimination due to stereotypes and stigma surrounding genetic conditions. This can limit their job opportunities and earning potential, further exacerbating financial challenges.
3. Social isolation: Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging, leading to social isolation and feelings of loneliness. Green card holders may face additional challenges in building a support network due to their immigration status.
4. Access to education: Depending on the severity of their condition, individuals with genetic conditions may struggle to access or complete higher education. This can limit their future career prospects and earning potential.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, stigma and discrimination against individuals with genetic conditions are still prevalent in many parts of society. Green card holders may face additional challenges in overcoming these barriers due to their immigration status.
6. Family dynamics: Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on family dynamics, particularly if the condition affects multiple members of the family. Green card holders may face added stress and emotional burden in managing these dynamics while also navigating their immigration status.
7. Insurance coverage: Individuals with genetic conditions may struggle to access affordable insurance coverage, which can exacerbate financial challenges and limit access to necessary medical care.
8. Limited access to support services: Depending on the severity of their condition, individuals with genetic conditions may require ongoing support services, such as counseling or home healthcare. Green card holders may face barriers in accessing these services due to their immigration status.
9. Emotional toll: Living with a genetic condition can take an emotional toll on individuals and their families
