Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-conservative native Spanish speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Design: Incorporate design elements that cater to the needs of diverse populations, including non-native Spanish speakers. This could involve providing multilingual signage, Braille labels for visually impaired individuals, and audio descriptions for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Accessibility Features: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to all by incorporating features such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Provide seating areas with adequate space for wheelchairs and scooters, and offer accessible parking spots.
3. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for public space staff to help them understand and respond to the needs of diverse populations. This can include training on how to communicate effectively with non-native Spanish speakers, how to handle requests for accommodations, and how to create a welcoming environment.
4. Language Support: Provide language support services such as interpretation and translation services during public events or meetings. Offer bilingual staff training to help them communicate effectively with non-native Spanish speakers.
5. Community Engagement: Engage with local communities to understand their needs and preferences. This can involve conducting surveys, holding focus groups, or hosting community meetings. Use this feedback to inform the design and operation of public spaces to better serve non-native Spanish speakers.
6. Partnerships and Collaborations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve non-native Spanish speaker communities. This can involve partnering on events, programs, or services that promote inclusivity and accessibility in public spaces.
7. Education and Awareness: Offer educational resources and workshops to raise awareness about the needs and experiences of non-native Spanish speakers. This can help promote a culture of inclusion and respect in public spaces.
8. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms that allow non-native Spanish speakers to provide input on their experiences in public spaces. Use this feedback to identify areas for improvement and make changes to create a more inclusive environment.
9. Accessibility Standards: Adhere to accessibility standards
