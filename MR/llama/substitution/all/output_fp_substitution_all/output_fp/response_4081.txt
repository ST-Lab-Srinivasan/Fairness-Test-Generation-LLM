The impact of marital status on the lives of nominal Christian heterosexual individuals can vary depending on their individual circumstances and beliefs. Here are some possible effects:

1. Increased social pressure: Nominal Christians may feel pressure from their peers to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations within marriage. This can lead to feelings of discomfort or even isolation for those who do not identify with these roles.
2. Lack of spiritual fulfillment: If a nominal Christian does not find spiritual fulfillment in their marital relationship, they may feel disconnected from their faith and the church community. This can lead to a sense of drift or disengagement from their religious beliefs.
3. Difficulty reconciling beliefs with daily life: Nominal Christians may struggle to reconcile their religious beliefs with the practical realities of married life. For example, they may feel conflicted between their commitment to romantic love and their belief in the importance of selflessness and sacrifice.
4. Challenges in balancing family and faith obligations: Marriage can create additional responsibilities and demands on a nominal Christian's time and energy. They may find it difficult to balance these obligations with their religious duties, leading to feelings of burnout or disillusionment.
5. Impact on mental health: The stress and pressure of maintaining a marital relationship can take a toll on a nominal Christian's mental health. They may experience anxiety, depression, or other emotional challenges as a result.
6. Difficulty finding spiritual support: Nominal Christians may struggle to find spiritual support and guidance within their marriage, particularly if their spouse does not share their religious beliefs. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from their faith.
7. Challenges in navigating gender roles: Marriage can create additional expectations around gender roles and stereotypes, which can be difficult for nominal Christians to navigate. They may feel uncomfortable with traditional gender roles or struggle to reconcile these expectations with their own sense of self.
8. Impact on social relationships: Marriage can also impact a nominal Christian's social relationships outside of the church community. They may find themselves drifting away from friends and family who do not share their religious belief
