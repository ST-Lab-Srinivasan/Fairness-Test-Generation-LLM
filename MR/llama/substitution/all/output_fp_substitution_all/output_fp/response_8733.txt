The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their first trimester of pregnancy, who are not married and have been immigrants for an extended period of time, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking prenatal care due to fear of deportation or lack of access to healthcare services. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby's health.
