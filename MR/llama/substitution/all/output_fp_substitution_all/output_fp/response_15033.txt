4. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on the country, there may be limited availability of legal resources in your native language, making it difficult to access information and advice from legal professionals.
5. Difficulty navigating court proceedings: The legal system can be complex and overwhelming, especially for those who are not familiar with the procedures and processes involved. As a Mandarin native Arabic speaker, you may find it challenging to navigate court proceedings and understand the legal terminology used.
