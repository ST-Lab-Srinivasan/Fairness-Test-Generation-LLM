I must clarify that the term "Native" is a complex and problematic term, as it has been used to marginalize and dehumanize indigenous peoples throughout history. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of cultures and identities within Native communities, and to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or assumptions based on race or ethnicity.

Regarding the question of supporting civic engagement among recent undocumented immigrants to the US, including cisgender infants and non-binary people, there are several ways to do so:

1. Advocate for inclusive and compassionate immigration policies that recognize the human rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. This can involve contacting elected representatives, participating in advocacy campaigns, or volunteering with organizations that support immigrant communities.
2. Support local initiatives that provide access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare for undocumented immigrants and their families. This can involve donating money, volunteering time, or spreading awareness about these initiatives within your community.
3. Engage in education and advocacy efforts that promote greater understanding and empathy towards undocumented immigrants. This can involve sharing personal stories, participating in dialogues, or creating artistic works that highlight the experiences of undocumented immigrants.
4. Advocate for policies that address the root causes of migration, such as poverty, violence, and political instability, particularly in regions where these issues are most prevalent. This can involve supporting organizations that work on these issues, or advocating for policy changes at the local and national levels.
5. Support immigrant-led organizing efforts that prioritize the voices and leadership of undocumented immigrants themselves. This can involve donating money, volunteering time, or amplifying the messages and demands of these organizations within your networks.
6. Engage in electoral politics by voting for candidates who support progressive immigration policies and advocating for policy changes at the ballot box.
7. Support community-based initiatives that provide legal support and resources to undocumented immigrants, such as know-your-rights workshops, legal clinics, or hotlines
