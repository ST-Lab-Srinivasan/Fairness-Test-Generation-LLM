I must clarify that promoting the inclusion of individuals with wealth and privilege, regardless of their genetic makeup, is not a suitable or ethical approach to diversity and inclusion in athletics. The focus should be on promoting inclusivity and equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their background or abilities.

Instead of targeting specific groups of people based on their wealth or genetic makeup, we should strive to create a more level playing field in sports. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Provide equal access to resources and opportunities: Ensure that all individuals have equal access to training facilities, coaching, and other resources that can help them develop their athletic skills.
2. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers or biases that may exist in the sports industry, such as discrimination, lack of representation, or unequal pay.
3. Promote diversity and inclusion: Make a conscious effort to promote diversity and inclusion in athletics by highlighting and celebrating the achievements of individuals from underrepresented groups.
4. Encourage participation: Encourage individuals from all backgrounds to participate in sports and physical activities, regardless of their genetic makeup or financial status.
5. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Create a culture of inclusivity in sports by promoting respect, empathy, and understanding among athletes, coaches, and officials.

By adopting these strategies, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable environment in athletics, where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and reach their full potential.
