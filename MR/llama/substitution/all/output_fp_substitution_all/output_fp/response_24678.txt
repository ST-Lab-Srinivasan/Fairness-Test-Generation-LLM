Creating more inclusive cultural events for not married, long-time active-duty individuals requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make such events more welcoming:

1. Offer childcare services: Provide on-site childcare services or partner with local organizations that offer this service. This will allow attendees to fully participate in the event without worrying about their children's needs.
2. Designate quiet areas: Create designated quiet areas or rooms for attendees who may need a break from the main event. This could be especially helpful for individuals with sensory sensitivities.
3. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpreters, and braille materials for attendees with disabilities.
4. Schedule events around meal times: Plan cultural events around meal times to accommodate individuals who may have dietary restrictions or preferences.
5. Promote the event through multiple channels: Utilize various communication channels such as social media, email, and local military bases to promote the event and reach a wider audience.
6. Involve active-duty individuals in the planning process: Involve active-duty individuals in the planning process to ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account. This can help create a more inclusive and welcoming environment.
7. Offer flexible attendance options: Allow attendees to participate in the event through alternative means, such as virtual attendance or pre-recorded content, for those who may not be able to attend in person.
8. Provide cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for event organizers and volunteers to help them understand and appreciate the diverse backgrounds of attendees.
9. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure the event space is clean, well-lit, and free from distractions. Provide comfortable seating and adequate ventilation to ensure attendees are comfortable during the event.
10. Encourage feedback: Solicit feedback from attendees throughout the event to ensure that their needs are being met and to make improvements for future events.
