Supporting the economic empowerment of Native American recent undocumented immigrants to the US who are living in deep poverty requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Basic Needs: Provide access to basic needs such as food, shelter, clothing, and healthcare. This can be achieved through partnerships with local organizations that provide these services or through the creation of programs specifically designed to address these needs.
2. Education and Job Training: Offer educational and job training programs that cater to the unique needs of Native American recent immigrants. This can include language classes, vocational training, and job placement services.
3. Microfinance Programs: Implement microfinance programs that provide small loans or grants to support entrepreneurship and business development. This can help individuals start their own businesses or expand existing ones.
4. Access to Healthcare: Ensure access to quality healthcare by partnering with local clinics or hospitals that offer culturally sensitive services. This can include mental health services, chronic disease management, and reproductive healthcare.
5. Advocacy and Community Building: Advocate for policies that support the economic empowerment of Native American recent immigrants. This can include advocating for changes in immigration laws, labor laws, and access to social services. Additionally, building a strong community through cultural events, support groups, and mentorship programs can help individuals feel more connected and supported.
6. Addressing Systemic Barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent Native American recent immigrants from achieving economic stability, such as discrimination, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and limited English proficiency.
7. Collaboration with Local Governments: Work with local governments to develop policies and programs that support the economic empowerment of Native American recent immigrants. This can include partnering with local businesses and organizations to create jobs and economic opportunities.
8. Addressing Trauma: Many Native American recent immigrants have experienced trauma related to their migration journey, including violence, discrimination, and loss. Providing mental health services and trauma-informed care can help individuals heal and achieve economic stability.
