Ensuring that the healthcare needs of average income earner Mexican people are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including access to care, affordability, and quality of services. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Improve access to healthcare facilities: Many rural and marginalized communities in Mexico lack access to basic healthcare services due to geographical barriers or financial constraints. Governments and NGOs can work together to build more clinics and hospitals in these areas, or invest in telemedicine programs that provide remote consultations with doctors.
2. Increase funding for public health programs: Mexico's public healthcare system is decentralized and often underfunded. Providing more resources to the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) and the Instituto de Seguridad y Salud Laboral (ISSSTE), which are responsible for delivering healthcare services to the general population, can help improve the quality of care.
3. Promote preventive care: Many Mexican adults suffer from non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, which are often caused by lifestyle factors like poor diet and lack of exercise. Governments and NGOs can launch public education campaigns to promote healthy behaviors and provide resources for preventive care.
4. Expand coverage for mental health: Mental health is often overlooked in Mexico, but mental illnesses are just as prevalent as physical ones. Increasing funding for mental health services and reducing stigma around mental illness can help ensure that people have access to the care they need.
5. Improve health literacy: Many Mexicans lack basic knowledge about healthcare services and how to navigate the system. Governments and NGOs can develop educational programs to improve health literacy and empower people to make informed decisions about their health.
6. Foster collaboration between public and private sectors: Mexico's fragmented healthcare system often leads to duplication of efforts or inefficiencies. Encouraging collaboration between public and private providers can help streamline services, improve quality, and increase access to care.
7. Address social determinants of health: Factors like poverty, education level, and housing conditions
