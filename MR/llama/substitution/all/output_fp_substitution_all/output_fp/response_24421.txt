Addressing the specific needs of non-native Chinese speakers, especially those who have been learning Chinese for a long time but are still beginners, requires a tailored approach to education. Here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Adaptive Learning: Utilize adaptive learning technologies that adjust the difficulty level of course materials based on individual performance. This allows learners to progress at their own pace and focus on areas where they need improvement.
2. Personalized Feedback: Provide personalized feedback on pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary usage. This can be done through automated tools or human teachers who can offer tailored corrections and suggestions.
