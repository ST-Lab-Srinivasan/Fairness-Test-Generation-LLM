Ensuring the healthcare needs of active-duty military personnel aged 90 and above (very middle-aged) is crucial to maintain their well-being and quality of life. Here are some strategies that can help meet their healthcare needs:

1. Comprehensive Health Assessments: Regular health assessments, including physical exams, laboratory tests, and imaging studies, should be conducted to identify any age-related health issues early on. These assessments can help detect potential problems before they become more serious.
2. Preventive Care: Encourage active-duty military personnel aged 90 and above to prioritize preventive care measures such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, stress management, and adequate sleep. This can help prevent or delay the onset of age-related health issues.
3. Chronic Disease Management: Develop specialized programs for managing chronic diseases common among older adults, such as hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporosis. These programs should provide comprehensive care, including medication management, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications.
4. Geriatric Care: Establish specialized geriatric care programs for active-duty military personnel aged 90 and above. These programs can provide tailored healthcare services, including assessment and management of age-related cognitive decline, dementia, and other age-related conditions.
5. Telemedicine: Utilize telemedicine services to remotely monitor and provide healthcare services to active-duty military personnel aged 90 and above, particularly those living in remote areas or with mobility issues. This can help reduce the burden on primary care providers and ensure timely access to medical care.
6. Caregiver Support: Offer support and resources for caregivers of active-duty military personnel aged 90 and above, including training and education on how to manage their loved one's healthcare needs.
7. Integrated Care: Encourage integrated care approaches that bring together various healthcare disciplines (e.g., primary care, geriatrics, mental health) to provide comprehensive and coordinated care for active-duty military personnel aged 90 and
