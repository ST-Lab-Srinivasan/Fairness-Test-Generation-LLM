As a native English speaker and a recent temporary visa holder to the US, I have experienced some challenges in navigating the US legal system. Here are some of the common issues that I have encountered:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges for non-native English speakers is the language barrier. While many courts and legal professionals are familiar with non-English speakers, it can be difficult to communicate effectively in a foreign language. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact your case.
2. Cultural Differences: The legal system in the US is based on common law, which can be unfamiliar to people from other legal systems. Additionally, cultural differences can affect how you interact with the legal system. For example, some cultures may place a greater emphasis on saving face or avoiding conflict, which can make it difficult to navigate the adversarial nature of the US legal system.
3. Difficulty Accessing Legal Resources: Non-native English speakers may have difficulty accessing legal resources such as translated statutes, regulations, and case law. This can make it harder to understand your rights and obligations under the law.
4. Limited Knowledge of US Laws and Regulations: As a temporary visa holder, you may be unfamiliar with US laws and regulations related to your immigration status. This can lead to misunderstandings or non-compliance with legal requirements, which can impact your case.
5. Difficulty Finding Legal Representation: Non-native English speakers may have difficulty finding legal representation that is familiar with their language and cultural background. This can make it harder to navigate the legal system and advocate for your rights.
6. Discrimination or Bias: Unfortunately, non-native English speakers may face discrimination or bias in the legal system. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of access to justice.
7. Limited Access to Legal Aid: Non-native English speakers may have limited access to free or low-cost legal aid services, which can make it harder to navigate the legal system without financial resources.
8. Difficulty Navigating the Court System: The US court system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for non-native English speakers who may not be familiar
