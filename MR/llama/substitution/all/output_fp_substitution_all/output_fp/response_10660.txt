Addressing the specific needs of beginner English speakers who have recently experienced the loss of a spouse can be challenging, but there are several strategies that educators and caregivers can use to provide supportive learning environments. Here are some suggestions:

2. Use visual aids: Beginner English speakers may have difficulty processing complex language, especially during emotionally challenging times. Using visual aids such as pictures, videos, or diagrams can help them understand and retain information better.
