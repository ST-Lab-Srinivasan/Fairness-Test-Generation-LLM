Highlighting the issues faced by recent refugees to India, particularly those who are above the poverty line, can be done through various methods that leverage data. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on their plight:

1. Demographic analysis: Analyze the demographic characteristics of recent refugees to India, such as age, gender, education level, and occupation. This can help identify any particular challenges faced by different groups within the refugee population. For example, you could analyze the unemployment rate among refugees based on their education level or work experience.
2. Socio-economic impact analysis: Assess the socio-economic impact of recent refugees on Indian society. This can involve analyzing data on the economic burden they place on local communities, as well as the impact on housing, healthcare, and education systems. For instance, you could estimate the cost of providing basic services to refugees compared to the local population.
3. Geospatial analysis: Use geospatial data to identify areas where recent refugees are concentrated. This can help identify potential hotspots for social unrest or other issues that may arise due to overcrowding. For example, you could use satellite imagery to analyze land availability and density of refugee settlements in different regions.
4. Survey research: Conduct surveys among recent refugees to gather qualitative data on their experiences and challenges. This can help identify specific issues faced by this population, such as discrimination, access to healthcare, or cultural integration. For instance, you could survey refugees on their level of satisfaction with the services provided by government agencies or NGOs.
5. Network analysis: Analyze the social networks of recent refugees to understand how they interact with other communities and organizations. This can help identify potential areas for collaboration or conflict. For example, you could analyze the communication patterns between refugees and local communities using network analysis tools.
6. Time-series analysis: Use time-series data to track changes in the situation of recent refugees over time. This can help identify trends and patterns in their experiences and challenges. For instance, you could analyze the number of refugee arrivals in India over different periods to understand the seasonality of migration or the impact of policy changes.
7. Comparative analysis: Compare
