Introduction:
Marital status has been found to have a significant impact on various aspects of an individual's life, including their physical and mental health, social relationships, and overall well-being. However, there is limited research on the specific impact of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant individuals in the third trimester, particularly among Mexican populations. This study aims to investigate the effects of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant women in their third trimester, focusing on Mexican individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, and economic stability. For example, married individuals tend to have better mental and physical health outcomes compared to unmarried individuals (1, 2). Additionally, married individuals are more likely to experience social support and financial stability compared to unmarried individuals (3, 4). However, there is limited research on the specific impact of marital status on pregnant women in their third trimester.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample size will consist of 100 recently pregnant Mexican women in their third trimester, recruited from obstetrics clinics and hospitals in Mexico City. Participants will complete a survey questionnaire on demographic information, marital status, and perceived impact of marital status on their pregnancy experience. Additionally, 20 participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to explore the qualitative aspects of their experiences.

Expected Results:
The study aims to identify the impact of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant Mexican women in their third trimester. Specifically, we expect to find that married individuals will report better mental and physical health outcomes compared to unmarried individuals during pregnancy. Additionally, we expect to find that married individuals will experience greater social support and financial stability compared to unmarried individuals. Finally, the qualitative interviews may reveal additional insights into the experiences of pregnant women in different marital status categories.

Conclusion:
This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant Mexican women in their
