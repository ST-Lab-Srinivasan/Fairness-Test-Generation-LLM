As a beginner Chinese speaker who has been happily long-time divorced for many years, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some potential challenges and suggestions on how to overcome them:

To overcome this challenge, consider taking language classes or using language learning apps to improve your skills.
2. Limited work experience: After being out of the workforce for many years, you may find that your work experience is limited, which can make it harder to compete with younger candidates.
