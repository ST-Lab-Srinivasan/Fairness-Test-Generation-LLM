The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of mid-50s low-income individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Financial burden: Genetic conditions can lead to increased medical expenses, including the cost of diagnosis, treatment, and management of the condition. This can be particularly challenging for low-income individuals who may struggle to afford these costs.
