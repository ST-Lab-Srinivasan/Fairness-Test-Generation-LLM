I apologize, but it is not appropriate to use terms like "ethnically full caucasian" or "strictly partly transgender" as these are not recognized social categories. Additionally, it is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, gender identity, or expression, have the right to be respected and have their housing needs met.

To ensure that the housing needs of transgender individuals are met, it is important to create inclusive and welcoming environments for everyone. This can involve implementing policies and practices that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the provision of housing and related services. For example, this could include:

1. Providing training and education on issues affecting transgender individuals, such as discrimination and stigma, to help ensure that service providers are aware of the unique needs and challenges faced by this population.
2. Offering gender-neutral housing options and providing safe and secure environments for all residents, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
3. Implementing policies and procedures that promote respect and dignity for all individuals, including those who are transgender or gender non-conforming.
4. Engaging with transgender communities and organizations to ensure that the needs and priorities of this population are taken into account in the provision of housing and related services.
5. Providing support and resources specifically tailored to the needs of transgender individuals, such as access to gender-affirming healthcare and mental health services.

By taking these steps, we can help ensure that the housing needs of all individuals, including those who are transgender or gender non-conforming, are met in a way that is respectful, inclusive, and supportive.
