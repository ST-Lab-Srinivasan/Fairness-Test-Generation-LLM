Ensuring the voices of native French speakers, who are recent refugees to the US, are heard in decision-making processes requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Advocacy groups: Establish or support local advocacy groups made up of native French speakers who have recently arrived in the US as refugees. These groups can act as a collective voice to raise awareness and push for policies that address their specific needs.
2. Community engagement: Engage with local communities, including non-profit organizations, schools, and government agencies, to build partnerships and create opportunities for native French speakers to contribute their perspectives in decision-making processes.
3. Language classes: Provide language classes specifically tailored to the needs of refugees, which can help them improve their English skills while also providing a platform for them to share their experiences and opinions.
