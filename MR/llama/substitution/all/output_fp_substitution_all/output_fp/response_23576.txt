As a permanent resident, ex-spouse individuals in the healthcare system may face several challenges, including:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: Permanent residents may not have the same access to healthcare as Canadian citizens or landed immigrants, particularly if they do not have a valid medical card or cannot afford health insurance.
2. Language barriers: Ex-spouses who are not fluent in the dominant language of their region may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers and navigating the system.
3. Limited knowledge of healthcare options: Permanent residents may be less aware of the available healthcare services and resources, particularly if they have recently arrived in Canada.
4. Difficulty accessing specialized care: Ex-spouses may encounter difficulties accessing specialized medical care, such as oncology or cardiology, due to limited availability or long wait times.
5. Discrimination or stigma: Permanent residents may experience discrimination or stigma based on their immigration status, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
6. Limited cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of ex-spouses, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
7. Financial barriers: Ex-spouses may face financial barriers in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status or limited income.
8. Lack of continuity of care: Permanent residents may experience disruptions in their healthcare due to changes in their immigration status, leading to gaps in their medical history and treatment.
9. Limited access to home care: Ex-spouses may face difficulties accessing home care services, such as personal care or housekeeping, due to limited availability or affordability.
10. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Permanent residents may find it challenging to navigate the complex healthcare system in Canada, particularly if they are not familiar with the available services and resources.

To address these challenges, healthcare providers and policymakers can take several steps, such as:

1. Providing language support services for ex-spouses who are not fluent in the dominant language of their region.
2. Offering cultural competency training
