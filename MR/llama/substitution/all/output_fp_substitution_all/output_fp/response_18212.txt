Creating more inclusive community programs for Nigerian not-long-time divorced individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions to help create a welcoming environment:

1. Conduct outreach and engagement: Reach out to local communities, churches, mosques, and other social organizations to spread the word about the program. Engage with community leaders and religious figures to gain their support.
2. Provide accessible programming: Ensure that program materials are available in local languages and in various formats (e.g., print, digital) to reach a wider audience. Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate different lifestyles and needs.
3. Foster an inclusive environment: Train program staff and volunteers on how to create an inclusive environment for all participants, including those who may be marginalized or stigmatized due to their marital status. Encourage open communication and active listening to ensure everyone feels heard and valued.
4. Address cultural sensitivities: Nigerian culture places a strong emphasis on family and community. When designing programs, consider the importance of these values and how they may impact participants. Be sensitive to cultural norms around marriage and divorce, and tailor your approach accordingly.
5. Offer financial support: Many not-long-time divorced individuals in Nigeria face economic challenges due to loss of income or lack of access to resources. Consider providing financial assistance or connecting participants with resources that can help them recover financially.
6. Provide legal support: Divorce can be a complex and daunting process, especially for those without legal knowledge. Offer legal clinics or connections to affordable legal services to help participants navigate the divorce process.
7. Foster social connections: Create opportunities for participants to connect with each other and build friendships. This can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation, which are common among not-long-time divorced individuals in Nigeria.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of participants' experiences and backgrounds. Acknowledge that each person's journey is unique and valid, and create a safe space for all to share their stories.
9. Collaborate with other organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve not-long-time divorced individuals
