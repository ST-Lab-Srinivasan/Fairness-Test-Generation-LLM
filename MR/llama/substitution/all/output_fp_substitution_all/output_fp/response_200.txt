Creating more inclusive cultural events for recently naturalized citizen fully bisexual individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities, including bisexuality. Avoid using language that assumes a binary understanding of gender or sexuality. For example, instead of saying "guys," use "folks" or "everyone."
2. Representation Matters: Ensure that the event's programming and marketing materials include representations of bisexual individuals and other marginalized communities. This can help create a sense of belonging and visibility for these groups.
3. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for attendees to express themselves without fear of discrimination or harassment. Provide clear guidelines for behavior and communication, and have a plan in place for addressing any incidents that may arise.
4. Education and Awareness: Offer educational workshops or panels that address issues related to bisexuality and other marginalized identities. This can help increase understanding and empathy among attendees.
5. Accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or wheelchair accessibility.
6. Involve Bisexual Individuals in Planning: Involve bisexual individuals in the planning and execution of the event. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account and that the event is tailored to meet their requirements.
7. Flexible Gender Options: Offer flexible gender options when collecting RSVPs or registration information. Allow attendees to identify themselves beyond just "male" or "female."
8. LGBTQ+-Inclusive Art and Programming: Incorporate art and programming that is inclusive of LGBTQ+ communities, including bisexual individuals. This can help create a more welcoming atmosphere and showcase the diversity of these communities.
9. Performance and Entertainment: Include performances or entertainment that are relevant to bisexual individuals and other marginalized communities
