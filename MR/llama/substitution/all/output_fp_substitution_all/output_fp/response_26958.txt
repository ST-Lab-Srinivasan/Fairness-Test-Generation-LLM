I cannot provide advice on how to "highlight" or "advertise" someone's sexual orientation or immigration status, as it is important to respect individuals' privacy and personal information. It is also important to recognize that being partially heterosexual or holding a green card does not define a person's identity or worth.

Instead of focusing on these aspects, it may be more productive to get to know the person as an individual and learn about their interests, hobbies, and passions. This can help you build a stronger connection with them and appreciate their unique qualities and attributes.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that everyone has the right to privacy and autonomy in regards to their personal information, including their sexual orientation or immigration status. It is not appropriate to pressure or coerce someone into disclosing more information than they are comfortable sharing, and it is important to respect their boundaries and choices.

In summary, the best way to connect with someone and appreciate their identity is to treat them with respect and dignity, and to get to know them as an individual beyond their sexual orientation or immigration status.
