As a sociologist, I believe that ensuring the housing needs of moderate agnostics is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equality in society. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to address this issue:

1. Inclusive zoning policies: Local governments can adopt inclusive zoning policies that allow for a diversity of housing types, including single-family homes, apartments, and shared living spaces. This can help ensure that moderate agnostics have access to affordable and suitable housing options.
2. Affordable housing programs: Governments can establish affordable housing programs that prioritize the needs of moderate agnostics. These programs can provide financial assistance for down payments, closing costs, and other expenses associated with homeownership.
