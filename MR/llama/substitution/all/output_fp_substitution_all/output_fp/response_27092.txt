There are several ways to ensure that the financial needs of mid-50s temporary visa holders who are recent refugees to the US are met:

1. Financial Assistance Programs: Non-profit organizations and government agencies can provide financial assistance programs specifically designed for recent refugees in their mid-50s. These programs can offer grants or loans to help cover basic living expenses, such as rent/mortgage, food, and medical care.
2. Employment Support: Providing job training and placement services can help recent refugees find employment and become financially independent. This can include language classes, job readiness training, and career counseling.
3. Microfinance Programs: Microfinance programs can provide small loans or grants to recent refugees to start their own businesses or purchase assets that can generate income. This can help them become financially independent and achieve economic stability.
4. Health Insurance: Ensuring access to affordable health insurance is crucial for recent refugees, especially those in their mid-50s who may have pre-existing medical conditions. Governments or non-profit organizations can provide subsidized health insurance plans or connect them with community clinics that offer sliding-scale fees based on income.
5. Housing Assistance: Providing temporary housing assistance, such as rental subsidies or help finding affordable housing, can help recent refugees in their mid-50s who may be facing financial challenges related to housing costs.
6. Education and Training: Offering language classes, vocational training, and academic programs can help recent refugees acquire new skills and knowledge that can increase their earning potential. This can also help them become more integrated into their host society.
7. Community Support: Building a strong support network of fellow refugees and local volunteers can provide emotional support and practical help with daily tasks, such as childcare or transportation. This can help recent refugees in their mid-50s feel less isolated and more connected to their community.
8. Advocacy and Awareness: Raising awareness about the challenges faced by recent refugees in their mid-50s can garner support from the broader community and influence policy changes that address these issues.
