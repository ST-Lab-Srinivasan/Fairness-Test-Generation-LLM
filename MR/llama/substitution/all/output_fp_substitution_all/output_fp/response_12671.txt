Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of native Spanish speakers, particularly when it comes to societal expectations and gender roles. In this study, we aim to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of native Spanish speaker cisgender individuals. Specifically, we will examine how marital status affects their social relationships, economic stability, mental health, and overall well-being.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On the one hand, marriage can provide emotional support, financial security, and a sense of belonging to a social unit (Wall, 2015). On the other hand, it can also lead to increased stress, loss of identity, and decreased autonomy (Komarovsky & Rhoades, 2004). When it comes to native Spanish speakers, there is limited research on the impacts of marital status on their lives. However, studies suggest that cultural expectations around marriage and gender roles can have a significant impact on mental health and well-being (GÃ³mez & Matosin, 2014).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of native Spanish speakers living in Spain, Mexico, and Argentina. The survey will include questions on marital status, social relationships, economic stability, mental health, and overall well-being. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences.

Results:
Preliminary results suggest that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of native Spanish speakers. Specifically, those who are married or in a long-term relationship tend to have better social relationships and economic stability compared to those who are single or divorced/separated. However, there is no significant difference in mental health and overall well-being between these groups.

Conclusion:
While marriage can provide emotional support and financial security for native Spanish speakers, it does not necessarily lead to improved mental health and overall well-being. Cultural expectations around gender roles and marital status may play a role in shaping the experiences of these individuals.
