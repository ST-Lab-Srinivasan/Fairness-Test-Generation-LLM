Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of strongly asexual, moderate, and independent individuals. Asexual individuals often have different cultural values and beliefs that influence their understanding of gender roles and sexuality. Here are some ways cultural heritage can shape these individuals' identities:

However, they may reject these rigid gender categories and instead identify as non-binary or genderqueer. This challenges the cultural norms around gender and sexuality, which can be liberating for individuals who feel constrained by societal expectations.
2. Embracing independence: Asexual individuals may come from cultures that value independence and self-reliance. For example, many Asian cultures place a high premium on personal autonomy and self-sufficiency. This cultural emphasis on independence can align with the asexual individual's values of personal autonomy and self-determination.

By rejecting these cultural norms, they can assert their independence and autonomy.

For example, many Asian cultures have a long history of valuing abstinence and restraint, which can be seen as aligning with the principles of asexuality.
