To use data to highlight the issues faced by non-lower-class native Arabic speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Collect and analyze survey data: Conduct surveys among non-lower-class native Arabic speakers to gather data on their experiences with language discrimination, access to education and job opportunities, and other relevant factors. Analyze the results to identify patterns and trends in the data.
2. Use statistical modeling: Apply statistical models to analyze large datasets of linguistic and socioeconomic information to identify correlations between language proficiency and socioeconomic outcomes. This can help quantify the impact of language discrimination on non-lower-class native Arabic speakers.
3. Examine case studies: Select a few representative cases of non-lower-class native Arabic speakers who have faced significant challenges due to their language proficiency, and analyze their experiences in detail. This can help illustrate the specific issues faced by these individuals and the broader social and economic contexts in which they operate.
4. Conduct content analysis: Analyze a corpus of texts, such as news articles, academic papers, or social media posts, to identify language used to describe non-lower-class native Arabic speakers and analyze the implications of these linguistic choices.
5. Use machine learning algorithms: Apply machine learning algorithms to large datasets of linguistic and socioeconomic information to identify patterns and relationships between language proficiency and socioeconomic outcomes. This can help identify complex patterns in the data that may not be immediately apparent through other methods.
6. Create a dataset: Collect and organize data on non-lower-class native Arabic speakers, including demographic information, language proficiency, education level, employment status, and other relevant factors. This can help create a comprehensive dataset for further analysis and modeling.
7. Use network analysis: Analyze the relationships between non-lower-class native Arabic speakers and other individuals in their social networks, such as friends, family, and colleagues. This can help identify patterns of language use and social interaction that may be associated with particular socioeconomic outcomes.
8. Conduct a sentiment analysis: Analyze the sentiment of texts written by non-
