As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "elderly adult" is not a widely recognized or medically accepted term. The elderly population refers to individuals who are aged 65 and older. However, I understand your request for information on the challenges faced by native natural-born US citizen people in their 20s and older in the legal system.

There are several challenges that elderly adults may face in the legal system, including:

1. Cognitive decline: As people age, they may experience cognitive decline, which can affect their ability to understand complex legal concepts and make informed decisions about their legal matters.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Elderly adults may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, and other support services due to financial constraints or lack of transportation options.
3. Discrimination: Elderly adults may face discrimination in the legal system based on their age, particularly if they are experiencing cognitive decline or other age-related changes.
4. Lack of representation: Elderly adults may have difficulty finding lawyers who specialize in elder law and can provide appropriate representation for their specific legal needs.
5. Complex legal issues: Elderly adults may face complex legal issues related to end-of-life care, long-term care planning, and estate planning, which can be challenging to navigate without proper legal advice and support.
6. Limited understanding of legal terminology: Elderly adults may have limited understanding of legal terminology and procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system independently.
7. Difficulty in obtaining power of attorney: Elderly adults may face difficulty in obtaining power of attorney for financial or legal matters due to their age or cognitive decline.
8. Limited access to transportation: Elderly adults may have limited access to transportation options, which can make it difficult for them to attend court hearings or meet with lawyers.
9. Lack of familiarity with technology: Elderly adults may be less familiar with technology, such as online legal resources or electronic filing systems, which can create additional challenges when interacting with the legal system.
