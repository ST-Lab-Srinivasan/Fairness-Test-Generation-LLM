As a permanent resident carrying a genetic condition, individuals may face unique challenges in the job market. These challenges can range from discrimination and stigma to physical limitations and lack of accommodations. Here are some of the common challenges faced by permanent residents with genetic conditions:

1. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against individuals with genetic conditions is still prevalent in many workplaces. Employers may hold biases against hiring or promoting individuals with genetic conditions, which can limit their career advancement opportunities.
2. Stigma: Living with a genetic condition can lead to social stigma, which can impact an individual's confidence and self-esteem in the workplace. This stigma can also lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion, making it difficult for individuals to connect with their colleagues and build meaningful relationships.
3. Physical limitations: Depending on the nature of the genetic condition, individuals may experience physical limitations that can impact their ability to perform certain job tasks. For example, they may have difficulty typing or using a computer mouse due to hand tremors, or they may have limited mobility that makes it difficult to stand for long periods.
4. Lack of accommodations: Many employers are not aware of the accommodations that individuals with genetic conditions may need to perform their job duties. For example, some may require assistive technology or adaptive equipment to help them complete tasks more efficiently. Without these accommodations, individuals with genetic conditions may struggle to keep up with their workload.
5. Emotional toll: Living with a genetic condition can take an emotional toll on individuals, leading to anxiety, depression, and stress. These emotional challenges can impact an individual's ability to perform their job duties, leading to decreased productivity and job satisfaction.
