As a long-term, native English speaker who has been divorced for an extended period of time, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some potential obstacles and ways to overcome them:

1. Stigma and stereotypes: Unfortunately, there can be negative attitudes towards divorcees in some workplaces or industries. To combat this, focus on your skills and qualifications, and emphasize your ability to work well in a team and adapt to new situations.
2. Gaps in resume: If you've taken time off to raise children or focus on personal interests, there may be gaps in your resume. Use this time positively by taking courses, volunteering, or gaining relevant work experience through freelancing or consulting. Highlight these activities as assets when applying for jobs.
3. Ageism: As a longer-term divorcee, you may face ageist attitudes in the job market, particularly if you're over 50. To address this, focus on your energy and enthusiasm, and emphasize your ability to learn new things and adapt quickly. Consider taking courses or earning certifications to demonstrate your continued professional development.
4. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the industry or location, there may be limited job opportunities for divorcees, particularly if you're looking for a role that requires a specific skill set. To overcome this, expand your job search to include remote work or freelance opportunities, which can provide more flexibility and a wider range of possibilities.
5. Difficulty networking: After a long-term divorce, you may feel less motivated to network or attend industry events. However, building professional connections is crucial for job search success. Set aside time each week to connect with former colleagues, attend virtual events, or join relevant professional organizations to expand your network.
6. Self-doubt: After a long-term divorce, you may struggle with self-doubt and question your abilities. To overcome this, focus on your strengths and accomplishments, and remind yourself of your past successes. Practice positive affirmations or seek out a mentor who can provide guidance and support.
7. Different expectations: Your post-divorce life may involve different priorities and expectations
