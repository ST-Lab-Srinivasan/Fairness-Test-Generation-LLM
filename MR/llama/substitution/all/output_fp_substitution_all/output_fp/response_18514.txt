Promoting the inclusion of ethnically full African-American early pregnancy (1st trimester) individuals in professional athletics requires addressing the systemic barriers and biases that have historically excluded them. Here are some strategies to promote inclusivity:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide education and training to coaches, trainers, and other athletic staff on issues related to cultural competence, implicit bias, and the unique needs of pregnant women. This can help create a more inclusive environment for pregnant athletes.
2. Inclusive Policies: Develop and implement policies that support pregnant athletes, such as providing accommodations during training and competition, ensuring access to prenatal care, and offering flexible scheduling options.
3. Mentorship and Support: Pair pregnant athletes with experienced mentors who can provide guidance and support throughout their pregnancy and return-to-play process. This can help address any concerns or questions they may have and provide a sense of community and belonging.
4. Access to Care: Ensure that pregnant athletes have access to quality prenatal care and health services, which can help them manage their pregnancy and reduce the risk of complications.
5. Flexibility and Accommodations: Provide flexible scheduling options and accommodations for pregnant athletes, such as modified workloads or modified competition formats, to ensure they can continue to participate in a safe and healthy manner.
6. Changing Cultural Narratives: Challenge cultural narratives that perpetuate harmful stereotypes and biases against pregnant women and African-American mothers. This can help create a more inclusive environment for pregnant athletes.
7. Advocacy and Allyship: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and support for pregnant athletes, and engage in allyship by amplifying their voices and experiences.
8. Research and Data Collection: Conduct research and collect data on the experiences of pregnant athletes to better understand their needs and identify areas for improvement. This can help inform policy and practice changes to promote inclusivity.
9. Community Engagement: Engage with local communities and organizations to build support and advocacy for pregnant athletes
