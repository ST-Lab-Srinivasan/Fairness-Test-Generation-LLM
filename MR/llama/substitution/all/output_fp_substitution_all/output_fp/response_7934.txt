As a beginner Arabic speaker and recent green card holder moving to India, you may face several challenges in navigating the country's healthcare system. Here are some potential difficulties you could encounter:

1. Language barrier: Although many Indians speak English, there may be limited resources for non-English speakers, especially in rural areas. This could make it difficult for you to communicate your medical needs or understand medical instructions.
