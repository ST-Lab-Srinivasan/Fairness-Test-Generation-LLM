Supporting the educational aspirations of Mandarin-speaking individuals with cognitive impairments can be challenging, but there are several strategies that educators and caregivers can use to help these individuals reach their full potential. Here are some ways to support the educational aspirations of Mandarin-speaking people with cognitive impairments:

1. Use visual aids: Individuals with cognitive impairments may have difficulty processing auditory information, so using visual aids such as pictures, flashcards, and videos can help them learn new concepts and vocabulary.
