The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of late 30s deeply lower-class people can be significant and far-reaching. These individuals may face a range of challenges, including:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Lower-class individuals may have limited access to medical care, which can exacerbate the impact of genetic conditions. They may struggle to afford expensive medical treatments or procedures, and may not be able to access preventive care or early interventions.
2. Stigma and social isolation: Genetic conditions can lead to stigma and social isolation, particularly if the condition is perceived as "unattractive" or "inferior." Lower-class individuals may face additional challenges in dealing with these issues, as they may lack social support networks or access to resources that could help them cope.
3. Economic hardship: Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on an individual's ability to work and earn a living. Lower-class individuals may face economic hardship due to medical expenses, lost income, or reduced productivity.
4. Limited educational opportunities: Lower-class individuals may have limited access to education and training, which can limit their ability to adapt to changing circumstances or find new employment opportunities. This can be particularly challenging for individuals with genetic conditions that require ongoing medical care or accommodations.
5. Lack of representation and advocacy: Lower-class individuals may lack access to advocacy groups or other resources that could help them navigate the healthcare system or address social stigma. They may also face barriers in accessing legal or financial support.
6. Difficulty navigating bureaucratic systems: Lower-class individuals may face challenges in navigating complex bureaucratic systems, such as those related to disability benefits or medical care. This can be particularly difficult for individuals with genetic conditions that require ongoing care and support.
7. Limited access to mental health resources: Lower-class individuals may have limited access to mental health resources, such as therapy or counseling, which can exacerbate the emotional impact of living with a genetic condition.
8. Difficulty finding adequate housing and transportation: Lower-class individuals may face challenges in finding affordable and accessible housing, as well as transportation options
