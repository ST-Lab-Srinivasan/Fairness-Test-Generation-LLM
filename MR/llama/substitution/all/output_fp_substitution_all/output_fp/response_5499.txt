Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Beginner French Speakers Post-Divorce

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have recently gone through a life-altering event such as divorce. As beginner French speakers, this group may face unique challenges in navigating their cultural identity during this transitional period. This research aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of recently divorced beginner French speaker individuals and what strategies they employ to maintain a sense of self.

Theoretical Framework:
This study draws on the social constructivist theory, which posits that identity is constructed through interactions with others and the environment (Berger & Luckmann, 1966). The theory of identity formation (Kvale, 2001) and the concept of intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1989) will also inform this research.

Research Questions:

1. How do recently divorced beginner French speaker individuals perceive their cultural heritage in relation to their identity?
2. What strategies do they employ to maintain a sense of self amidst the challenges of divorce and language learning?
3. How does their cultural heritage influence their experiences of identity formation and language acquisition?

Methodology:
This qualitative study will employ semi-structured interviews with 20 recently divorced beginner French speaker individuals. Participants will be recruited through local language schools and online forums. Data collection and analysis will follow thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) to identify patterns and concepts related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities.

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of how cultural heritage influences identity formation among recently divorced beginner French speaker individuals. The findings will provide insights into the strategies they employ to maintain a sense of self and inform language teaching and learning practices that can better support this population.

Conclusion:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently divorced beginner French speaker individuals. By examining the ways in which these individuals navigate their cultural identity, this study will provide
