Expecting parents may face several challenges when seeking employment in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Maternity and Paternity Leave: Expecting mothers may face difficulties in taking maternity or paternity leave, as many employers may not provide adequate paid leave or flexible work arrangements for new parents.
2. Lack of Accommodations: Expecting parents may face challenges in finding workplaces that provide adequate accommodations for breastfeeding or pumping milk, particularly in male-dominated industries where these facilities may not be readily available.
3. Stigma and Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to pregnancy and parenthood in some workplaces, leading to discrimination against expecting parents. This can manifest in various ways, such as being passed over for promotions or being subjected to unfair working conditions.
4. Career Advancement: Expecting mothers may face challenges in advancing their careers due to the perceived burden of childcare responsibilities. This can result in slower career progression or a lack of opportunities for advancement.
5. Pay Equity: Expecting mothers may face challenges in achieving pay equity, particularly if they take time off for maternity leave. This can lead to a significant gap in earnings compared to their male colleagues.
6. Work-Life Balance: Expecting parents may struggle to achieve a healthy work-life balance, as they may feel pressure to prioritize their family responsibilities over their professional obligations.
7. Lack of Support: Expecting parents may not have access to adequate support systems, such as childcare services or parental leave policies, which can make it challenging to manage work and family responsibilities.
8. Limited Career Options: Expecting mothers may face limitations in their career choices due to societal expectations and gender roles. For example, they may be steered towards lower-paying jobs or roles that are perceived as less demanding.
9. Stereotyping and Bias: Expecting parents may encounter stereotyping and bias in the workplace, which can affect their performance and opportunities
