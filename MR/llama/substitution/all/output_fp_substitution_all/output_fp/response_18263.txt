The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent resident long-time widowed people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased financial burden: Long-time widowed people with disabilities may face additional financial challenges due to their reduced income or increased expenses related to their disability. This can make it harder for them to maintain their standard of living, pay bills, and cover basic needs.
2. Social isolation: Disability can lead to social isolation, as people with disabilities may find it difficult to participate in social activities or visit friends and family due to mobility issues or other barriers. This can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
3. Loss of independence: Permanent residents with disabilities may experience a loss of independence, as they may require assistance with daily tasks such as bathing, dressing, and managing their finances. This can be especially challenging for those who valued their independence before the onset of their disability.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, people with disabilities are often subject to stigma and discrimination, which can further marginalize and isolate them. Long-time widowed people with disabilities may face additional challenges in accessing services and resources due to ableism or ageism.
5. Limited access to healthcare: People with disabilities may encounter difficulties when seeking medical care, as they may face barriers such as inaccessible clinics or hospitals, lack of accommodations for their disability, or discrimination by healthcare providers.
6. Emotional challenges: Losing a spouse can be emotionally devastating, and the added burden of a disability can exacerbate these feelings of grief and loss. Long-time widowed people with disabilities may experience depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result.
7. Reduced quality of life: Disability can significantly impact the quality of life of long-time widowed people, as they may face limitations in their ability to participate in activities, travel, or enjoy leisure time. This can lead to feelings of frustration and despair.
8. Lack of support:
