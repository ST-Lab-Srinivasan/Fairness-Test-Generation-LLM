Supporting the educational aspirations of beginner Spanish speakers who are not in a romantic relationship can be challenging, but there are several ways to provide guidance and encouragement. Here are some suggestions:

1. Encourage their interest: Show your support by expressing enthusiasm for their decision to learn Spanish. Share your own experiences with the language and the benefits you've gained from learning it.
2. Provide resources: Offer to help them find resources such as textbooks, language learning apps, or online courses that can aid in their learning process.
3. Practice together: Suggest practicing Spanish together, either through conversation or language-learning activities like grammar exercises or vocabulary building. This can help them stay motivated and engaged in the learning process.
4. Set goals and track progress: Help them set achievable goals for their Spanish learning journey, and offer to track their progress along the way. This can help them stay motivated and focused on their objectives.
5. Encourage consistency: Remind them that consistent practice is key to language learning, and encourage them to make learning Spanish a regular part of their routine.
6. Celebrate milestones: Acknowledge and celebrate their progress and achievements along the way, no matter how small they may seem. This can help them stay motivated and encouraged in their language-learning journey.
7. Be patient: Learning a new language can be challenging, so it's essential to be patient with them and understand that setbacks are a normal part of the process. Offer support and encouragement when needed, but also allow them to learn at their own pace.
8. Encourage immersion: Suggest ways they can immerse themselves in the Spanish language, such as watching Spanish movies or TV shows, listening to Spanish music, or speaking with native speakers. This can help them gain a deeper understanding of the language and culture.
9. Provide feedback: Offer constructive feedback on their pronunciation, grammar, or vocabulary usage, but do so in a gentle and supportive manner. Help them identify areas for improvement and provide suggestions for how to overcome any challenges they may be facing.
10. Be a role model: Show them that learning a new language is possible by sharing your own experiences
