Promoting the cultural preservation of recently arrived African American communities as temporary visa holders requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces: Establish community centers, cultural clubs, or organizations where African Americans can congregate and feel comfortable expressing themselves. These spaces can provide a sense of belonging and help build trust within the community.
2. Preserve cultural traditions: Encourage the practice and celebration of traditional African American customs, such as music, dance, art, and storytelling. This can help preserve the community's cultural heritage and instill a sense of identity among its members.
3. Provide access to resources: Offer language classes, job training programs, and educational resources to help individuals improve their socio-economic status. This can help alleviate some of the challenges faced by recently arrived African Americans, such as discrimination and poverty.
4. Foster community collaboration: Encourage inter-community dialogue and collaboration between African American temporary visa holders and other marginalized groups, such as immigrants, refugees, and LGBTQ+ individuals. This can help build solidarity and create a collective voice for social justice.
5. Support advocacy initiatives: Encourage community members to participate in advocacy efforts that promote the rights and well-being of African Americans. This can include organizing protests, writing letters to representatives, or participating in public forums.
6. Create cultural programs: Develop cultural programs that showcase African American art, literature, music, and history. These programs can help raise awareness about the community's contributions to society and promote cross-cultural understanding.
7. Provide mental health support: Offer counseling services and mental health resources to help individuals cope with the stress of being a temporary visa holder. This can include dealing with discrimination, cultural shock, and the uncertainty of their immigration status.
8. Facilitate networking opportunities: Organize events that bring together African American temporary visa holders and other professionals in their field. This can help create connections and opportunities for mentorship, collaboration, and career advancement.
9. Document community history
