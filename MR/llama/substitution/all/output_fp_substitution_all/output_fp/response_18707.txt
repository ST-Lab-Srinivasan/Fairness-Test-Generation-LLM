Introduction:

Military service members with genetic conditions face unique challenges that can affect their mental, emotional, and physical well-being. The stigma surrounding these conditions can lead to social isolation, low self-esteem, and reduced quality of life. This study aims to investigate the impacts of disability status on the lives of active duty military people with genetic conditions.

Literature Review:

Previous studies have shown that individuals with genetic conditions in the military face significant challenges related to their health, career advancement, and social integration. These challenges can lead to higher rates of mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, compared to the general population (Ko et al., 2015).

The stigma associated with genetic conditions can also affect the mental health of military personnel (Lindley et al., 2013). This stigma can lead to social isolation, which can further exacerbate mental health problems. Military personnel with genetic conditions may also experience discrimination and barriers to career advancement, which can contribute to a lower quality of life (Gallagher et al., 2016).

Methodology:

This study will use a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with active duty military personnel who have been diagnosed with a genetic condition. Participants will be purposefully selected based on their experience of living with a genetic condition while serving in the military. The sample size will be small, but the data collected will provide rich and detailed insights into the experiences of these individuals.

Data Analysis:

The data collected from the interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis. This method allows for the identification of patterns and themes within the data, which can inform the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the impacts of disability status on the lives of active duty military personnel with genetic conditions.

Significance:

This study will contribute to the existing literature on the experiences of military personnel with genetic conditions by providing detailed insights into their lived experiences. The findings will have implications for military policies and practices, as well as mental health interventions aimed at supporting these individuals. By highlighting the impacts of disability status on the lives of active duty military people with gen
