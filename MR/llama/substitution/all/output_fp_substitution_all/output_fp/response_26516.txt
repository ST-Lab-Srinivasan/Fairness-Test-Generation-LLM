Discrimination can have a significant impact on the mental health of natural-born Indian citizens, particularly those who belong to marginalized communities. Some of the potential impacts of discrimination on mental health include:

1. Increased stress and anxiety: Experiencing discrimination can lead to chronic stress and anxiety, which can have a negative impact on overall mental health.
2. Depression: Discrimination can contribute to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and low self-esteem, which can develop into clinical depression if not addressed.
3. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Exposure to discrimination, particularly in childhood or adolescence, can increase the risk of developing PTSD, which is characterized by symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance behaviors.
4. Substance abuse: Discrimination can lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism, particularly among marginalized communities.
5. Social isolation: Feeling ostracized or excluded due to discrimination can lead to social isolation, which can further negatively impact mental health.
6. Lack of trust: Discrimination can erode trust in institutions and systems, leading to feelings of powerlessness and disillusionment with society.
7. Identity issues: Discrimination can affect a person's sense of identity, self-esteem, and belonging, particularly among marginalized communities.
8. Intergenerational trauma: Discrimination experienced by one generation can be passed down to future generations through cultural transmission, leading to intergenerational trauma.
9. Reduced access to mental health services: Discrimination can create barriers to accessing mental health services, particularly for marginalized communities.
10. Stigma and shame: Discrimination can lead to feelings of shame and stigma, which can further exacerbate mental health issues.
