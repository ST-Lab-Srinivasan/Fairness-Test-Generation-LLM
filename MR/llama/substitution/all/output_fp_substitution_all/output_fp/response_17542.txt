Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Undocumented Orthodox Jewish Individuals

Introduction:
Undocumented immigrants, particularly those from religious minority groups, face unique challenges in their journey to the United States. This study aims to examine the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of undocumented recent temporary visa holders who are Orthodox Jewish individuals. By exploring the intersections of religion, culture, and immigration status, this research seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these factors intersect to shape the identities of this vulnerable population.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrants (Hood & Mills, 2017). For Orthodox Jewish individuals, their cultural heritage is deeply rooted in their religious beliefs and practices. However, the immigration process can be particularly challenging for this group due to the cultural and religious differences between their home country and the US (Koppel, 2013).

Undocumented immigrants often face social isolation and discrimination, which can further erode their sense of identity (Portes & Zhou, 1993). The added layer of religious and cultural differences can make it even more challenging for Orthodox Jewish individuals to navigate the US immigration system.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with undocumented Orthodox Jewish individuals who have recently entered the US on a temporary visa. The participants will be recruited through community outreach programs and social services organizations that cater to the Orthodox Jewish population.

The interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The themes that emerge from the data will include the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities, the challenges faced by undocumented immigrants, and the strategies used to navigate the immigration system.

Expected Findings:
The study aims to identify how cultural heritage influences the identities of undocumented Orthodox Jewish individuals. Specifically, it will explore how their religious beliefs and practices
