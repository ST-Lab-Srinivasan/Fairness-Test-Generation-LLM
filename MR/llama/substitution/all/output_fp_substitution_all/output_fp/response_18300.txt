Non-citizens who are not recently married may face a range of challenges when accessing healthcare in the United States. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Lack of access to health insurance: Many non-citizens, including those who are undocumented or have temporary status, are not eligible for Medicaid or other government-funded health insurance programs. This can make it difficult for them to afford medical care, particularly if they do not have access to employer-based insurance or private insurance.
2. Language barriers: Non-citizens may face language barriers when attempting to navigate the healthcare system, particularly if they do not speak English fluently. This can make it difficult for them to communicate with healthcare providers, understand medical instructions, and access care.
3. Discrimination: Non-citizens may face discrimination in the healthcare system, particularly if they are undocumented or have a temporary status. This can lead to delays or denials of care, as well as a lack of trust in the healthcare system.
4. Difficulty accessing specialized care: Non-citizens may face difficulties accessing specialized care, such as cancer treatment or mental health services, due to a lack of knowledge about available resources or fear of discrimination.
5. Limited cultural competency training: Healthcare providers may not receive adequate cultural competency training, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications with non-citizens. This can result in inadequate care or delays in diagnosis and treatment.
6. Lack of knowledge about available resources: Non-citizens may be unfamiliar with the healthcare system and the resources available to them, which can lead to difficulties accessing care.
7. Fear of deportation: Non-citizens may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of deportation or detention by immigration authorities. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, as well as a lack of trust in the healthcare system.
8. Limited access to preventive care: Non-citizens may have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups and screenings, due to a lack of insurance or knowledge about available resources.
