Addressing the Specific Needs of Divorced, Long-Time Devout Muslims in College: A Gradual Approach

Introduction:
As a college educator, I have noticed a growing number of students who are divorced and long-time devout Muslims. These individuals face unique challenges that are not always addressed by traditional campus resources. This article proposes a gradual approach to addressing the specific needs of these students, ensuring they feel supported and connected on campus.

I. Identifying and Understanding the Needs of Divorced, Long-Time Devout Muslims

1. Lack of spiritual support: Divorced individuals may struggle to find like-minded spiritual communities, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection from their faith.
2. Balancing academic and religious responsibilities: These students may need help balancing academic demands with Islamic practices and rituals, particularly during the academic year.
3. Navigating social dynamics: Divorced individuals may face challenges navigating social situations, particularly those that involve mixed gender interactions or potential romantic partners.
4. Coping with past trauma: Some divorced students may carry emotional baggage from their previous marriages, requiring additional support to heal and move forward.

II. Creating a Supportive Campus Environment

1. Establish a Muslim Student Organization (MSO): An MSO can provide a platform for students to connect with one another, share experiences, and engage in Islamic activities. This organization can also serve as a liaison between the student body and campus administrators.
2. Host regular iftar and suhoor events: During Ramadan, hosting iftar and suhoor meals can help students feel more connected to their faith and community. These events can also foster interfaith dialogue and understanding among non-Muslim students.
3. Provide access to Islamic scholarship and resources: Offering access to Islamic texts, lectures, and workshops can support students' spiritual growth and development.
4. Trained counselors or mentors: Identify trained mental health professionals or experienced Muslim mentors who can provide one-on-one support to students facing personal challenges related to their faith.
