Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly as they age. In France, where the political landscape is complex and polarized, the effects of political affiliation on older adults can be even more pronounced. This study aims to explore the impact of political affiliation on the lives of native French speakers aged 65 or older (over 85), including their social, economic, and cultural well-being.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. The sample will consist of 100 native French speakers aged 65 or older (over 85) who reside in the Paris metropolitan area. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling, targeting individuals who are members of political organizations or have demonstrated political engagement.

Data Collection:
Semistructured interviews will be conducted with participants to gather information on their political beliefs, social connections, and experiences. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. In addition, participants will complete a standardized questionnaire that assesses their economic and cultural well-being.

Data Analysis:
The interview data will be analyzed using thematic analysis, identifying patterns and themes in the participants' narratives. The survey data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistical methods, such as regression analysis.

Expected Findings:
This study will contribute to our understanding of how political affiliation affects the lives of older adults in France. Specifically, we expect to find that:

1. Political affiliation is associated with social connections and participation: Older adults who identify with a particular political party are more likely to have strong social connections with like-minded individuals and participate in political activities.
2. Economic well-being is influenced by political affiliation: We expect to find that older adults who identify with a left-leaning political party tend to have lower levels of economic well-being compared to those who identify with right-leaning parties.
3. Cultural well-being is affected by political affiliation: Older adults who identify with a particular political party may experience differences in cultural well-being, such as access to cultural activities and resources.
