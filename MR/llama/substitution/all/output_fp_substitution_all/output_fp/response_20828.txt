Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers from an ethnically Caucasian background involves understanding and valuing the diverse backgrounds and experiences of these individuals. Here are some strategies to help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Inclusive Programming: Offer programs that cater to the interests and needs of beginner English speakers from different ethnic backgrounds. This can include cultural events, workshops, and language classes tailored to their specific needs and interests.
2. Representation Matters: Ensure that the cultural programs you offer reflect the diversity of your target audience. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse perspectives, stories, and experiences into your programming.
3. Accessibility: Make sure that your cultural programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or backgrounds. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or audio descriptions for individuals with disabilities.
4. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for staff and volunteers on cultural competency, diversity, and inclusion. This can help them better understand the needs and experiences of beginner English speakers from different ethnic backgrounds.
5. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in your cultural programs. This can be achieved by involving local artists, performers, and community leaders in your events, and by providing opportunities for audience members to share their thoughts and feedback.
6. Inclusive Language: Use inclusive language in your marketing materials, programs, and communications. Avoid using language that may be offensive or alienating to specific ethnic groups.
7. Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that serve diverse communities to co-create cultural programs and reach a broader audience. This can help you better understand the needs of your target audience and provide more inclusive programming.
8. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input from beginner English speakers on how to improve the cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are meeting their needs and expectations.
9. Intersectionality: Consider the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, ability, and other factors that may impact an individual's experience. Be mindful of how these intersections may influence their experiences in cultural programs.
