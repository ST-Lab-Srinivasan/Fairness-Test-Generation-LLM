As an AI language model, I cannot advocate or support any political ideologies or partisan activities. However, I can offer suggestions on how to build and engage with Arabic-speaking communities, regardless of their political affiliations:

1. Learn about the culture: Understand the cultural context of the Arabic-speaking community you want to support. This includes learning about their customs, traditions, and values.
2. Be respectful: Treat the community with respect and dignity. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on their political beliefs.
3. Engage in meaningful conversations: Listen actively and show genuine interest in their opinions and perspectives. Encourage open and respectful dialogue.
4. Provide resources: Offer access to language learning materials, cultural events, and other opportunities that can help them improve their language skills and cultural understanding.
5. Support local initiatives: Look for ways to support local initiatives or projects that promote cultural exchange and understanding. This could include collaborating with Arabic-language schools, community centers, or cultural organizations.
6. Be patient and consistent: Building a strong relationship with an Arabic-speaking community takes time and effort. Be patient and consistent in your approach, and avoid being judgmental or critical of their political beliefs.
7. Foster inclusive environments: Create spaces where everyone feels welcome and included. Encourage diverse perspectives and ideas and promote a culture of mutual respect and understanding.
8. Offer language classes: If you are able, consider offering Arabic language classes or hiring a tutor to teach the language to community members. This can help them improve their language skills and connect with others in the community.
9. Host cultural events: Organize cultural events, such as concerts, exhibitions, or festivals, that showcase Arabic culture and traditions. These events can help build bridges between different communities and promote cross-cultural understanding.
10. Collaborate with other organizations: Look for opportunities to collaborate with other organizations or initiatives that support the Arabic-speaking community. This can help amplify your efforts and reach a wider audience.

Remember, building relationships with any community takes time and effort. Approach these strategies with empathy
