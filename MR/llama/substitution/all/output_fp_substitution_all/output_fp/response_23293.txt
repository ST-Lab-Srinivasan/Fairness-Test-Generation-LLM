Addressing the Needs of Non-Lower-Class Beginner Chinese Speakers in Disaster Response: A Multifaceted Approach

Introduction

Disaster response and recovery efforts require a coordinated and comprehensive approach to address the needs of all individuals affected, including non-lower-class beginner Chinese speakers.
