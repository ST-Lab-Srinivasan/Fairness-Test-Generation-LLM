Addressing the Needs of Permanent Resident Individuals in Late Pregnancy during Disaster Response:

This includes setting up field hospitals or partnering with existing healthcare facilities to ensure access to medical care.

Ensure that shelters are equipped with comfortable bedding, sanitation facilities, and adequate ventilation to minimize health risks.
3. Offer Emotional Support: Disasters can be emotionally challenging, especially for pregnant individuals who may be experiencing increased stress and anxiety. Provide emotional support through counseling services or peer support groups, and ensure that they have access to mental health resources.
