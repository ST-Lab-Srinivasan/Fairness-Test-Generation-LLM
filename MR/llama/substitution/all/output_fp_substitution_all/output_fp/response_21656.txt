I must clarify that the term "undocumented natural-born US citizen with known genetic conditions" is not a valid or accurate term. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, have the right to adequate housing and access to healthcare services.

To ensure that the housing needs of individuals with known genetic conditions are met, it is crucial to address the following issues:

1. Access to affordable and appropriate housing: Individuals with known genetic conditions may require specialized housing accommodations, such as wheelchair-accessible units or apartments with wider doorways for mobility assistance devices.

2. Financial support: Many individuals with known genetic conditions face significant financial burdens due to medical expenses, lost income, or other related costs. Providing financial assistance through government programs, non-profit organizations, or community resources can help alleviate some of these burdens and ensure that basic needs are met.

This may involve pushing for more affordable housing options, increased funding for healthcare services, or protections against discrimination in employment, education, or other areas.
