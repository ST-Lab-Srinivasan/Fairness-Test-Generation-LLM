Creating more inclusive community events for native Arabic speaker employed people requires careful consideration of their cultural background and language needs. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Provide translation support: Offer translation services during the event, such as live interpreters or printed materials in both the local language and Arabic. This will help ensure that all attendees can understand the content being presented.
2. Cater to cultural differences: Be sensitive to the cultural norms and practices of native Arabic speaker employed people. For example, avoid scheduling events during Ramadan or other important religious observances, and be respectful of dietary restrictions.
3. Use inclusive language: Make sure that all event materials, including flyers, posters, and signage, are translated into Arabic and use inclusive language that welcomes all attendees.
4. Offer childcare and transportation support: Many native Arabic speaker employed people may have young children or limited mobility, which can make it difficult to attend events outside of work hours. Offering childcare and transportation support can help remove these barriers and ensure that everyone has access to the event.
5. Create a diverse planning committee: Assemble a planning committee that reflects the diversity of the community, including native Arabic speaker employed people. This will help ensure that their perspectives and needs are taken into account when planning the event.
6. Incorporate cultural elements: Incorporate cultural elements from the local Arabic-speaking community into the event, such as traditional music, dance, or food. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
7. Offer accessible venues: Choose venues that are wheelchair accessible and have enough seating for attendees who may need it. Make sure there is adequate lighting and sound equipment to accommodate both Arabic and English speakers.
8. Provide language support during the event: Offer language support during the event, such as a designated area for native Arabic speaker employed people to connect with each other or a translation hotline for any questions or concerns.
9. Use technology to facilitate communication: Utilize technology, such as translation apps or virtual event platforms, to facilitate communication between attendees who may speak different languages
