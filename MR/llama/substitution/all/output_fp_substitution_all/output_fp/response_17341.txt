As a responsible AI language model, I appreciate your concern for supporting the educational aspirations of natural-born Indian citizens, including those who are long-time widows. Here are some ways to help:

1. Encourage them to pursue higher education: Many widows may have put their education on hold due to various reasons. Encourage them to pursue their academic interests and support them financially or emotionally in their educational endeavors.
2. Provide access to digital resources: With the advent of online learning platforms, it's now possible for people to access quality educational content from anywhere in the world. Offer to help them set up a computer or mobile device with internet connectivity and provide access to educational websites or apps.
3. Teach life skills: Widows may face various challenges in managing their daily lives, especially if they are not familiar with modern technology or social norms. Offer to teach them essential life skills such as basic computer literacy, time management, budgeting, and conflict resolution.
4. Facilitate access to vocational training: Many widows may find it challenging to find employment due to various reasons. Provide them with access to vocational training programs that can help them develop new skills and enhance their employability.
5. Encourage entrepreneurship: Widows often have unique experiences and perspectives that can be leveraged to start their businesses. Encourage them to explore entrepreneurial opportunities, provide mentorship and support, and help them access resources such as microfinance or business incubators.
6. Create a support network: Widows often face social isolation, which can exacerbate their emotional challenges. Create a support network of like-minded individuals who can offer emotional support, share experiences, and provide practical help when needed.
7. Advocate for policy changes: Many widows face discrimination or marginalization due to societal attitudes or legal barriers. Advocate for policy changes that promote gender equality, protect the rights of widows, and provide them with access to resources and opportunities.
8. Provide financial support: Financial stability is crucial for widows to pursue their educational aspirations. Offer financial assistance, such as scholarships or grants,
