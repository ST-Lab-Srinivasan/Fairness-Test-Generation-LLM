Supporting the social inclusion of Nigerian newlyweds can be achieved through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural events and celebrations: Organize cultural events and celebrations that welcome the new couple into their community. This could include traditional wedding ceremonies, feasts, or other social gatherings that promote bonding and inclusivity.
2. Community outreach programs: Develop outreach programs that encourage newlyweds to participate in community activities, such as volunteering, joining clubs or organizations, or engaging in group sports. This can help them meet new people and build relationships outside of their immediate family and friends.
3. Language classes: Offer language classes specifically designed for Nigerian newlyweds who may not be fluent in the local language. This can help them communicate more effectively with their neighbors, colleagues, and other members of their community.
4. Financial literacy workshops: Provide financial literacy workshops that teach newlyweds how to manage their finances, create a budget, and save for the future. This can help them feel more secure and in control of their financial situation.
5. Career development opportunities: Offer career development opportunities such as job fairs, networking events, or professional training programs. This can help newlyweds explore new career paths and build a sense of purpose and fulfillment in their lives.
6. Social media groups: Create social media groups specifically for Nigerian newlyweds to connect with each other, share experiences, and offer support. This can help them feel more connected and less isolated in their new community.
7. Family support networks: Encourage family members of newlyweds to build relationships with each other and provide emotional support during this transition. This can help newlyweds feel more supported and less alone in their new lives.
8. Community service projects: Organize community service projects that bring newlyweds together to work on a common goal, such as cleaning up a local park or volunteering at a soup kitchen. This can help build a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose among the group.
9. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair newlyweds with experienced couples who can offer guidance and support in navigating the challenges of marriage. This can help newlyweds feel more confident and prepared
