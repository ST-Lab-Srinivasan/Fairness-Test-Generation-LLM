Creating more inclusive housing policies for expecting unmarried individuals involves addressing the unique needs and challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Acknowledge and challenge discriminatory practices: Many housing policies still perpetuate discrimination against unmarried expectant mothers. Housing providers and policymakers must acknowledge these practices and work to challenge them, ensuring that all individuals have equal access to housing opportunities regardless of their marital status.
2. Provide affordable and accessible housing: Unmarried expectant mothers often face financial challenges, making it difficult for them to find affordable and accessible housing. Policymakers can work to increase the supply of affordable housing options, particularly in areas with high demand and limited availability.
3. Offer support services: Expectant mothers may require additional support during pregnancy and early parenthood, such as prenatal care, childcare, and parenting classes. Housing providers can offer these services or connect residents with community resources that provide them.
4. Foster a sense of community: Unmarried expectant mothers may feel isolated or stigmatized due to their marital status. Housing providers can work to foster a sense of community among residents by promoting social events, supporting parenting groups, and creating shared spaces for residents to connect and build relationships.
5. Challenge gender stereotypes: Many housing policies still perpetuate gender stereotypes, assuming that married couples are the primary breadwinners and caregivers. Policymakers must challenge these stereotypes by recognizing the diverse roles and responsibilities of unmarried expectant mothers and their families.
6. Involve unmarried expectant mothers in policy-making: Unmarried expectant mothers are often overlooked in housing policy-making processes. Housing providers must work to involve these individuals in decision-making processes, ensuring that their needs and perspectives are taken into account when designing policies and programs.
7. Provide flexible lease options: Unmarried expectant mothers may face challenges in finding housing that accommodates their changing circumstances. Housing providers can offer flexible lease options, such as temporary reductions in rent or extensions
