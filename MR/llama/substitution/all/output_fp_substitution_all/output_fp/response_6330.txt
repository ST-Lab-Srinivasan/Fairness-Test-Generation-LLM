Creating more inclusive cultural events for genderqueer conservative individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

Be open to hearing their preferences and respect their boundaries. For instance, they may prefer not to participate in events that are heavily focused on gender binaries or traditional gender roles.
