As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "deeply lower-class" is problematic and can be perceived as derogatory. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status or background, deserve equal respect and dignity within the legal system.

That being said, there are several challenges that people from disadvantaged backgrounds may face when interacting with the legal system. These include:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Individuals from lower-income communities may not have access to the same legal resources as those from more affluent areas. This can include things like legal aid organizations, pro bono representation, and access to legal libraries.
2. Language barriers: For individuals who are non-native speakers of the dominant language of the legal system (e.g. English in many countries), navigating legal procedures and documents can be particularly challenging.
3. Lack of legal knowledge: Many people from lower-income communities may not have received adequate legal education or training, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system without assistance.
4. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist within the legal system, particularly against marginalized groups such as people of color, women, and individuals from lower-income communities.
5. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Many people from lower-income communities may not have access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation or arbitration, which can be less expensive and time-consuming than going to court.
6. Power imbalances: The legal system is not always designed to address power imbalances between parties, particularly in cases where one party has more resources or influence than the other.
7. Limited access to legal representation: Many people from lower-income communities may not have access to legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
8. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system is often not designed to take into account the cultural backgrounds and values of individuals from diverse communities, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.
9. Limited access to technology: Many people from lower-income communities may not have access to technology such as computers
