Cultural competence is crucial in healthcare, especially when providing care to patients from diverse backgrounds. As a beginner Chinese speaker in an active-duty role, there are several benefits of cultural competence that can enhance your ability to provide quality care:

1. Improved patient rapport and trust: By demonstrating cultural knowledge and sensitivity, you can build stronger relationships with patients from diverse backgrounds. This can lead to increased patient satisfaction and trust, which is essential for providing high-quality care.

For example, in some Chinese cultures, direct eye contact is considered disrespectful, so being aware of these cultural differences can help you communicate more appropriately.
