Creating more inclusive community programs for natural-born Canadian citizen married couples requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make such programs more welcoming:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their marital status or background. Avoid assumptions about someone's identity or relationship status.

6. Relationship Coaching: Offer coaching sessions specifically designed for married couples. These sessions can cover topics such as communication, conflict resolution, and relationship maintenance.
