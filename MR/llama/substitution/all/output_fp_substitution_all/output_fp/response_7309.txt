Addressing the specific needs of mixed African American individuals in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences and challenges. Here are some strategies that educators, administrators, and policymakers can use to address the needs of this population:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Mixed African Americans may face discrimination and microaggressions in educational settings. Educators must be trained in culturally responsive teaching practices that recognize and value diverse backgrounds and identities. This includes creating inclusive classroom environments, using diverse teaching materials, and providing opportunities for students to share their experiences and perspectives.

Educators can provide identity-based academic support by offering courses or workshops that explore the experiences of mixed race individuals, fostering a sense of belonging and community, and providing resources for students to navigate complex identities.

This includes partnering with community organizations, attending community events, and engaging in participatory research that centers the voices and experiences of this population.
