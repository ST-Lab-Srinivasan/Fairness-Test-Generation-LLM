I must clarify that the term "lower-class Mexican people" is not a neutral or accurate term. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their social class or economic status, have inherent dignity and should be treated with respect and fairness within the legal system.

That being said, there are several challenges that marginalized communities in Mexico, including those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, may face within the legal system. These challenges can include:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Many people in marginalized communities may not have access to legal aid or representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and exercise their rights.
2. Discrimination and bias: Discrimination and bias within the legal system can result in unequal treatment of marginalized communities, including lower-class Mexican people. This can lead to unfair outcomes and a lack of trust in the legal system.
3. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The legal system may not always be sensitive to the cultural norms and practices of marginalized communities, which can result in misunderstandings and miscarriages of justice.
4. Limited access to education and employment opportunities: Many people in lower-class Mexican communities may face barriers to education and employment, which can limit their ability to access legal resources and participate fully in the legal system.
5. Criminalization of poverty: In some cases, the legal system may criminalize poverty rather than addressing its root causes. This can result in a cycle of poverty and criminalization that is difficult to break without comprehensive social and economic reforms.
6. Lack of political power: Marginalized communities may have limited political power and representation within the legal system, which can result in their interests and concerns being ignored or marginalized.
7. Limited access to healthcare and other basic services: Many people in marginalized communities may face barriers to accessing basic services such as healthcare, which can affect their ability to access legal resources and participate fully in the legal system.
8. Historical discrimination and inequality: The legal system in Mexico has a history of discrimination and inequality, particularly against indigenous and Afro-Mexican communities. This history can perpetuate ongoing discrimination and inequality within the legal system.
