As a Native American natural-born US citizen living with a genetic condition, you may face various challenges in the legal system. Here are some potential issues you could encounter:

1. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system often lacks cultural competency when dealing with indigenous peoples and their specific needs. This can result in miscommunication, misunderstandings, and poorly tailored solutions.
2. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against Native Americans is still prevalent in the US legal system. You may face biases or stereotypes based on your race or ethnicity, which can affect the outcome of your case.
3. Limited access to resources: Depending on where you live, you may have limited access to legal resources and representation. This can make it more challenging to navigate the legal system and advocate for yourself or your family member.
4. Jurisdictional issues: Genetic conditions can sometimes fall under the jurisdiction of multiple agencies or departments, leading to confusion and delays in getting the necessary support or services.
5. Inadequate laws and policies: The legal system may not have adequate laws and policies in place to address the unique needs of Native American communities, particularly when it comes to genetic conditions. This can result in a lack of support or resources for individuals living with these conditions.
6. Lack of trust: Historical trauma and ongoing discrimination against Native Americans have led to a breakdown of trust between tribal communities and the legal system. This can make it challenging to access legal services or advocate for your rights.
7. Limited language access: Depending on where you live, there may be limited language access in the legal system, which can hinder your ability to communicate effectively with legal professionals or navigate the legal process.
8. Cultural and spiritual beliefs: As a Native American living with a genetic condition, you may have cultural and spiritual beliefs that inform your understanding of health and wellness. The legal system may not always be able to accommodate these beliefs, leading to conflicts between your personal values and the legal system's expectations.
9. Stigma and shame: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma surrounding genetic conditions in many Native American communities. You may face discrimination or shame from family members, community members
