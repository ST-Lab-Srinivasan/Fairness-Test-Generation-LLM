Promoting the inclusion of moderate-risk pregnant athletes in professional sports requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the physical, emotional, and social challenges they face. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Education and Training: Provide healthcare providers, coaches, and trainers with training on managing pregnant athletes. This could include information on fetal development, normal pregnancy discomforts, and potential risks associated with exercise during pregnancy.
2. Clear Guidelines: Establish clear guidelines for pregnant athletes, including limitations on the intensity and duration of exercise. These guidelines should be based on the latest research and tailored to each athlete's individual needs and health status.
3. Fitness Assessments: Conduct regular fitness assessments to monitor each athlete's progress and adjust their training program as needed. This will help ensure that they are exercising at a safe level for both themselves and their fetus.
4. Medical Supervision: Provide regular medical supervision throughout the pregnancy, including monitoring of fetal growth and development, maternal health, and any potential complications.
5. Support Network: Create a support network for pregnant athletes, including coaches, trainers, and medical staff. This network can provide emotional support and help address any concerns or issues that may arise during the pregnancy.
6. Flexibility and Accommodations: Be flexible and accommodating when it comes to scheduling and training sessions for pregnant athletes. For example, consider holding individual sessions in a quieter environment or providing modifications to exercises to avoid any potential risks.
7. Communication: Encourage open communication between the athlete, coaches, trainers, and medical staff. This will help identify any potential issues early on and ensure that the athlete is receiving the appropriate care and support.
8. Research Collaboration: Collaborate with researchers to gather data on the safety and efficacy of exercising during pregnancy. This information can help inform guidelines and best practices for pregnant athletes in professional sports.
9. Athlete-Centric Approach: Take an athlete-centric approach when working with pregnant
