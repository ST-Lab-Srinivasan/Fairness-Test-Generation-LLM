3. Develop cultural competency: Provide training on cultural competency and unconscious bias to help decision-makers recognize and address potential biases in the decision-making process. This can include workshops, training sessions, or one-on-one coaching.
4. Establish mentorship programs: Pair native French speakers with mixed Asian heritage with experienced leaders who understand their perspectives and can provide guidance and support. This can help build confidence and opportunities for advancement.
