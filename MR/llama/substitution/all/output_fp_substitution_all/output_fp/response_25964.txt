Addressing the Specific Needs of Ethnically Full African-American Recently Divorced Individuals in Self-Taught Graduate Programs: A Personalized Approach

Introduction:
Ethnically full African-American individuals, particularly those who have recently gone through a divorce, face unique challenges in their pursuit of higher education. These challenges are often rooted in systemic barriers, such as discrimination and a lack of representation, which can hinder their academic success. As an educator, it is essential to acknowledge these obstacles and develop strategies to address them. This paper proposes a personalized approach to supporting ethnically full African-American recently divorced individuals in self-taught graduate programs.

I. Understanding the Unique Needs of Ethnically Full African-American Recently Divorced Individuals

1. Historical trauma: The legacy of slavery, segregation, and systemic racism has resulted in intergenerational trauma that continues to affect ethnically full African-Americans. This trauma can manifest in various ways, including anxiety, depression, and a lack of trust in institutions (Waters, 2017).
2. Microaggressions: Recently divorced individuals may face microaggressions, which are subtle, often unintentional expressions of bias or prejudice (Haviland-Jones & Kelley, 2015). These experiences can impact the well-being and academic performance of ethnically full African-American students.
3. Lack of representation: The underrepresentation of ethnically full African-Americans in higher education can lead to a sense of isolation and marginalization (Bowen, 2017). This lack of visibility can make it challenging for recently divorced individuals to find support and connect with peers.
4. Financial barriers: Recently divorced individuals may face financial difficulties, including debt and reduced income (Walker, 2018). These challenges can hinder their ability to pursue higher education, particularly if they are not eligible for financial aid or scholarships.
