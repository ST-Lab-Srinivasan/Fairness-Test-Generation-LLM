Supporting the community engagement of Native American, secular Jewish, and other marginalized groups in the US can be a complex and multifaceted issue. Here are some potential strategies that organizations and individuals can consider:

1. Advocate for policy change: Secular Jewish and Native American communities have faced discrimination and marginalization throughout history, and continue to face barriers to full participation in US society today. Advocating for policies that promote equity and inclusion, such as comprehensive immigration reform, can help address these issues.
2. Provide cultural and linguistic support: Many Native American and secular Jewish communities have unique cultural practices and languages that are important to their identity and sense of belonging. Providing language classes, cultural workshops, and other resources can help preserve and promote these cultural traditions.
3. Facilitate community building: Creating spaces for community members to connect and build relationships can help foster a sense of belonging and support. This can be done through events, gatherings, and other activities that bring people together around shared interests and values.
4. Offer legal services: Many Native American and secular Jewish individuals may face legal barriers to full participation in US society, such as discrimination in employment or housing. Providing free or low-cost legal services can help address these issues and promote greater access to opportunities.
5. Address systemic inequality: Secular Jewish and Native American communities have faced historical and ongoing systemic inequality, including discrimination in education, employment, and other areas. Addressing these issues through advocacy and community-based initiatives can help promote greater equity and inclusion.
6. Support indigenous-led initiatives: Many Native American communities are leading the way in promoting their own cultural preservation and revitalization. Supporting these initiatives, and amplifying their voices, can help promote greater understanding and respect for Native American cultures.
7. Create intercultural dialogue: Encouraging dialogue and exchange between different cultural communities can help build bridges of understanding and empathy. This can be done through events, workshops, and other activities that bring people together around shared interests and values.
8. Provide healthcare support: Many Native American and secular Jewish individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to systemic inequality
