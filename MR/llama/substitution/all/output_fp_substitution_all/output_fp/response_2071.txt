Creating more inclusive community events for active duty military long-term unemployed individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions on how to make such events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Understand the challenges faced by military personnel: It's essential to understand the unique challenges faced by military personnel, including the transition back to civilian life, job searching, and managing finances. Be aware of these challenges when planning events to ensure they are inclusive and supportive.
2. Involve military organizations: Collaborate with local military organizations, such as veterans' groups or bases, to reach a wider audience of active duty military personnel. These organizations can provide valuable resources and support for event planning.
3. Choose accessible locations: Select venues that are easily accessible for people with disabilities, including those with mobility issues, hearing impairments, or visual impairments. Provide clear signage, parking, and accessibility features to ensure all attendees can participate comfortably.
4. Offer job search support: Provide resources and support specifically tailored for military personnel looking for employment. This could include resume workshops, interview preparation, and connections to local businesses that are hiring.
5. Encourage networking: Create opportunities for attendees to connect with each other, including military personnel, employers, and community leaders. This can help foster relationships and job opportunities among attendees.
6. Provide childcare options: Offer childcare services or create a safe and welcoming space for children during the event. This will allow parents to focus on networking and job searching without worrying about their children's care.
7. Offer financial planning resources: Provide information and resources on managing finances, including budgeting, saving, and investing. This can help military personnel navigate the financial challenges of transitioning back to civilian life.
8. Incorporate mental health support: Recognize that transitioning back to civilian life can be emotionally challenging for some military personnel. Offer resources and support for mental health, including counseling services or stress management workshops.
9. Make it fun: Create a positive and enjoyable atmosphere at the event by incorporating games, entertainment, and food
