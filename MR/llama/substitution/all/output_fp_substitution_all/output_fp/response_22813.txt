Participate in advocacy campaigns and events to promote policy changes that benefit mentally able-bodied employees.
6. Share personal experiences: If you feel comfortable, share your personal experiences with mental health issues to help break down stigmas and promote understanding. Encourage others to do the same to create a culture of openness and empathy.
