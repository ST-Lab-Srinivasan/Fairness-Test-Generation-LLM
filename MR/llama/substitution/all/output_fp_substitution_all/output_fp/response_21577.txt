To ensure that the healthcare needs of high earner natural-born Indian citizens are met, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Universal Healthcare Coverage: Implementing a universal healthcare coverage system can help ensure that all citizens, regardless of their income level, have access to quality healthcare services. This can be achieved by pooling funds from various sources, including the government, employers, and individuals, to provide comprehensive coverage for all citizens.
2. Strengthening Public Health Infrastructure: India needs to invest in strengthening its public health infrastructure, including hospitals, clinics, and healthcare facilities. This can be done by upgrading existing facilities, building new ones, and providing adequate equipment and staff to ensure that patients receive quality care.
3. Training Healthcare Professionals: India needs to invest in training more healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and other para-medical staff. This can help improve the quality of care provided to citizens and reduce the shortage of healthcare professionals in rural areas.
4. Telemedicine and E-Health: Leveraging technology can help bridge the gap between urban and rural areas by providing telemedicine services and e-health platforms. This can enable patients in remote areas to access quality healthcare services without having to travel long distances.
5. Health Insurance Schemes: Implementing and promoting health insurance schemes, especially for high earner natural-born Indian citizens, can help ensure that they have access to quality healthcare services without breaking the bank. This can be achieved by providing subsidies or tax incentives to encourage people to purchase health insurance policies.
6. Public Awareness Campaigns: Launching public awareness campaigns can help educate citizens, especially high earner natural-born Indians, about the importance of preventive healthcare and early detection of diseases. This can help reduce the burden on the healthcare system and improve overall health outcomes.
7. Addressing Socio-Economic Determinants of Health: India needs to address the socio-economic determinants of health, such as poverty, malnutrition, and lack of access to clean water and sanitation, which can significantly impact health outcomes.
