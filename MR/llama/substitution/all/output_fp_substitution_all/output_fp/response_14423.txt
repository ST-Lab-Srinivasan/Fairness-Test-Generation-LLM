Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper middle-income and non-recently single individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the various challenges faced by these groups. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Addressing income inequality: Implement policies that promote fair distribution of wealth, such as progressive taxation, affordable housing initiatives, and access to quality education and job training programs. This can help reduce poverty and improve economic mobility for non-upper middle-income individuals.
2. Challenging discrimination: Enact laws and policies that protect the rights of marginalized groups, including those based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and disability. Encourage diversity and inclusion in all aspects of society, from education to employment to government representation.
3. Supporting mental health: Provide access to affordable mental health services, including counseling, therapy, and medication. This can help address the mental health challenges faced by non-recently single individuals, who may be at higher risk of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues due to social isolation and stigma.
4. Promoting social connections: Encourage community building and social interaction through initiatives such as volunteering, group sports, and cultural events. This can help non-upper middle-income individuals connect with others and build meaningful relationships, which are essential for overall well-being and happiness.
5. Advocating for policy changes: Work with policymakers to address the systemic issues that affect non-upper middle-income and non-recently single individuals. This can include advocating for policies that promote affordable housing, access to healthcare, and financial support for education and career development.
6. Supporting entrepreneurship: Encourage and support entrepreneurial efforts by providing resources such as mentorship, funding, and networking opportunities. This can help non-upper middle-income individuals build their own businesses and create economic stability.
7. Challenging stereotypes and stigmas: Work to challenge the negative stereotypes and stigmas associated with being non-upper middle-income or recently single. Encourage empathy and understanding
