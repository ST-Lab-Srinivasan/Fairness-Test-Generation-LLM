Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-native Spanish speakers, particularly those who are beginners. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can influence the identities of these individuals:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For example, a beginner Spanish speaker who is also Hispanic may feel more connected to their Hispanic identity and culture when learning Spanish. This sense of belonging can help them feel more confident and comfortable in their language learning journey.
2. Cultural references: Cultural heritage can provide a rich source of cultural references that are relevant to the learner's identity. For example, a beginner Spanish speaker who is also African American may find that their cultural references and experiences are reflected in the language and culture they are learning. This can help them feel more engaged and motivated in their language learning journey.
3. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can play a role in shaping the identity of non-native Spanish speakers, particularly those who are beginners. For example, a beginner Spanish speaker who is also Asian may find that their cultural experiences and traditions are reflected in their language learning. This can help them form their identity as a bilingual individual with a unique cultural background.
4. Cultural empathy: Cultural heritage can help non-native Spanish speakers develop cultural empathy, which is the ability to understand and appreciate the perspectives and experiences of people from different cultures. For example, a beginner Spanish speaker who is also Latinx may find that their cultural heritage helps them better understand the perspectives and experiences of Latinx individuals in Spanish-speaking communities.
5. Intersectionality: Cultural heritage can intersect with other aspects of an individual's identity, such as race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality. For example, a beginner Spanish speaker who is also queer may find that their cultural heritage influences the way they experience and interact with Spanish language and culture.
6. Power dynamics: Cultural heritage can influence power dynamics in language learning, particularly for non-native speakers who are beginners. For example, a beginner Spanish speaker who is also a member of a dominant culture may find that their cultural heritage gives them more power and privilege in language learning situations.
