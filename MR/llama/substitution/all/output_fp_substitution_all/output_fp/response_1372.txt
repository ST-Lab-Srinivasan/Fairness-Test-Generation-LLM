As a beginner Arabic speaker who is also an undocumented immigrant in the United States, you may face several challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the common difficulties that you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for undocumented immigrants is the language barrier. Arabic is a complex language with many grammatical rules and nuances, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system without proper guidance.
