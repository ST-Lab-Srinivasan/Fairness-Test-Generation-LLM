As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the term "lifelong divorced infant transgender people" is not a recognized or legitimate category of individuals.

They may experience challenges in their lives, including discrimination, stigma, and marginalization, but they are not "divorced" or "infant."

Regarding the legal system, transgender people may face various challenges, such as:

1. Lack of legal recognition: In many countries, there is no legal recognition of transgender identity, which can lead to difficulties in accessing rights and services.

3. Identity documents: Transgender people may encounter problems when trying to obtain identity documents, such as passports or driver's licenses, that match their gender identity.
