There are several challenges that non-high-income ethnically full Asian people may face in the healthcare system, including:

1. Language barriers: Many non-high-income ethnically full Asian people may not speak the dominant language of their country fluently, which can create difficulties when trying to communicate with healthcare providers or access healthcare services.
2. Cultural barriers: Different cultures have different beliefs and practices surrounding health and illness, and healthcare providers may not be familiar with these cultural differences. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can negatively impact care.
3. Limited access to healthcare services: Non-high-income ethnically full Asian people may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or other logistical challenges.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against Asian people still exist in many parts of the world, and can lead to negative experiences in the healthcare system.
5. Lack of culturally competent care: Healthcare providers may not be trained in cultural competence, which can lead to a lack of understanding of the unique needs and practices of ethnically full Asian communities.
6. Limited representation in medical research: Medical research often does not reflect the diversity of ethnic minority populations, including non-high-income ethnically full Asian people. This can lead to a lack of representation for these groups in clinical trials and other medical research.
7. Difficulty in navigating the healthcare system: Non-high-income ethnically full Asian people may face challenges in navigating the healthcare system, including finding providers who speak their language or understand their cultural practices.
8. Limited availability of culturally sensitive health resources: There may be a limited availability of culturally sensitive health resources, such as interpreters or culturally specific materials, in some areas.
9. Lack of understanding of traditional healing practices: Healthcare providers may not understand or respect traditional healing practices used by ethnically full Asian communities, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.
10. Stigma associated with seeking care: Non-high-income ethnically full Asian people
