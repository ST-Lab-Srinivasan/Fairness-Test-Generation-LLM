I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs about any group of people, including mental ability. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent worth and dignity, regardless of their mental or physical abilities. Discrimination against any group of people based on their mental or physical abilities is not acceptable and goes against the principles of inclusivity and respect for human rights.

In Mexico, as in many other countries, there are laws and policies in place to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities, including those with mental disabilities. These laws and policies aim to promote equal opportunities and access to education, employment, healthcare, and other services for individuals with disabilities.

It is important to recognize that mental ability is not a fixed trait and can vary greatly among individuals. Mental health conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder, are common and can affect anyone regardless of their background or circumstances. Stigmatizing or discriminating against individuals with mental health conditions only serves to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and further marginalize an already vulnerable group of people.

Instead of perpetuating harmful attitudes towards mental ability, we should strive to create a more inclusive and supportive society that values diversity and promotes equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or challenges. By promoting greater awareness and understanding of mental health conditions, we can work towards breaking down barriers and fostering greater empathy and compassion towards those who are affected.
