Educate and raise awareness: Offer training and resources for coaches, trainers, and team members on how to support pregnant athletes, including proper nutrition, hydration, and injury prevention techniques. Encourage open communication and create a safe space for individuals to share their concerns or questions.

Ensure that these policies are inclusive, flexible, and adaptable to meet the unique needs of each individual.
