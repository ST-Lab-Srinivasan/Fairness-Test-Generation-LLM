Advocating for the rights of Nigerian non-traditional families, such as those who are not lifelong married, can be challenging due to cultural and legal barriers. However, here are some effective ways to advocate for their rights:

1. Education and awareness: Educate yourself and others about the realities of non-traditional families in Nigeria. Use social media, community events, and workshops to raise awareness about the discrimination and marginalization faced by these families.
2. Advocacy groups: Form or join advocacy groups that specifically focus on the rights of non-traditional families. These groups can work together to lobby for policy changes and legal protections for these families.
3. Community outreach: Connect with local communities and organizations that support non-traditional families. Build alliances with other social justice groups, such as LGBTQ+ organizations, women's rights groups, and human rights organizations.
4. Legal challenges: Work with lawyers to challenge discriminatory laws and policies that affect non-traditional families. File lawsuits or submit amicus curiae briefs in support of non-traditional families.
5. Political engagement: Encourage non-traditional families to participate in the political process by voting, running for office, or volunteering for political campaigns. This can help shift the cultural and legal landscape in favor of non-traditional families.
6. Media campaigns: Use media platforms to amplify the voices of non-traditional families. Create media campaigns that highlight their experiences and push for greater acceptance and inclusivity.
7. Policy changes: Advocate for policy changes that recognize and protect the rights of non-traditional families. This can include changes to family law, social welfare policies, and labor laws.
8. Healthcare advocacy: Advocate for accessible and inclusive healthcare services for non-traditional families. This can include advocating for coverage of gender-affirming care, reproductive healthcare, and mental health services.
9. Economic empowerment: Work to promote economic empowerment for non-traditional families through initiatives such as financial literacy programs, entrepreneurship training, and access to microfinance loans.
