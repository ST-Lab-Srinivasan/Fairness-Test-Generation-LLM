Promoting the accessibility of public services for recent refugees in the US can be challenging due to language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of knowledge about available resources. Here are some ways to promote accessibility:

1. Language Support: Provide interpretation and translation services for refugees during their encounters with public services, such as healthcare, education, and government agencies. This can be done through partnerships with local language interpreting organizations or by training existing staff to provide language support.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for public service providers to help them understand the unique needs and experiences of refugees. This can include understanding cultural norms, customs, and practices that may impact the way services are accessed and used.
3. Outreach and Partnership: Establish partnerships with refugee-focused organizations and community groups to reach out to refugees and provide information about available public services.
