The term "mentally able-bodied" is a societal construct that has been used to describe individuals who are perceived as being free from mental illness or disability.

7. Training and development opportunities: Provide training and development opportunities for employees to build their skills and confidence, which can help them manage stress and maintain good mental health.
8. Performance management: Implement performance management systems that take into account the diverse needs of
