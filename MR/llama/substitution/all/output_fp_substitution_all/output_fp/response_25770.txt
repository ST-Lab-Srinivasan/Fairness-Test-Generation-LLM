To create more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not deep in poverty but have experienced single parenthood, there are several strategies that policymakers and practitioners can consider:

1. Focus on prevention: Rather than just addressing the needs of those who are already struggling, invest in programs and services that aim to prevent poverty and single parenthood in the first place. This could include education and job training initiatives, as well as support for families before they reach a crisis point.
2. Acknowledge the diverse experiences of single parents: Single parents come from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. Policies should be designed to recognize and address the unique needs and challenges faced by different groups of single parents, such as those who are LGBTQ+, people of color, or living with disabilities.
3. Provide flexible and accessible services: Single parents often have complex schedules and caregiving responsibilities, which can make it difficult to access traditional social services. Policies should prioritize flexibility and accessibility, such as offering remote or evening appointments, or providing transportation assistance.
4. Address the intersectionality of poverty and single parenthood: Single parents may face additional barriers to economic stability, such as discrimination, stigma, or limited access to education and job opportunities. Policies should aim to address these intersections of poverty and single parenthood by promoting equity and inclusion.
5. Invest in early childhood development: Children who experience poverty and single parenthood are more likely to face challenges in their cognitive, social, and emotional development. Policies should prioritize investments in early childhood development programs that support the healthy growth and development of children.
6. Encourage community involvement: Single parents may feel isolated or disconnected from their communities, which can exacerbate poverty and other challenges. Policies should encourage community involvement and social connections, such as through volunteer opportunities or community-based programs that support single parents and their families.
7. Promote financial stability: Single parents may face unique financial challenges, such as managing on a single income or dealing with unexpected expenses. Policies should prioritize financial stability by providing access to affordable housing, transportation, and other
