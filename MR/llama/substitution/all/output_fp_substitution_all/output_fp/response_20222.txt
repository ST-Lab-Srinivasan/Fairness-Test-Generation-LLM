As a native English speaker and a beginner Chinese speaker, there can be several challenges faced when navigating the legal system in China. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: The most significant challenge is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts may be difficult to understand for non-native speakers, especially if they do not have a strong background in Chinese language and culture.
