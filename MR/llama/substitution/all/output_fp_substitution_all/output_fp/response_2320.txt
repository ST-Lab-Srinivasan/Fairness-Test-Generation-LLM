Introduction:
Marriage is a significant institution in Nigeria, and it plays a crucial role in the social, economic, and cultural lives of its citizens. However, the experience of marriage can vary significantly depending on an individual's marital status. Expecting Nigerian individuals face unique challenges that are influenced by their marital status. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of expecting Nigerian individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of expectant mothers. For instance, married women are more likely to receive prenatal care and have better access to healthcare services than unmarried women (Akpan, 2016). Married women also tend to have higher levels of social support during pregnancy, which can improve their mental and emotional well-being (Oguoma et al., 2015). On the other hand, unmarried expectant mothers may face stigma and discrimination from family members and society at large, which can negatively affect their mental health and well-being (Okonta et al., 2016).

Methodology:
This study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A random sample of 300 expecting Nigerian women was recruited from public hospitals in Lagos state. Participants completed a questionnaire that assessed their marital status, access to healthcare services, social support, and mental health. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with a purposive sample of 20 participants to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of marital status on their lives.

Results:
The results showed that married expectant mothers had better access to prenatal care and healthcare services compared to unmarried women. Married women were also more likely to receive social support from their spouses and family members during pregnancy. In contrast, unmarried expectant mothers faced significant challenges in accessing healthcare services and experienced stigma and discrimination from family members and society at large. Qualitative findings revealed that unmarried women often felt isolated and alone during pregnancy, which can have negative impacts on their mental health and well-being.
