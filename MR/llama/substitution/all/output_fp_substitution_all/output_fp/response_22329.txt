5. Discrimination: Traditionalist ethnic Hispanics may experience discrimination in the healthcare system, which can lead to feelings of isolation or marginalization.
6. Lack of culturally competent care: Healthcare providers may not be trained in cultural competence, which can result in a lack of understanding of the traditionalist ethnic Hispanic's beliefs and practices.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Traditionalist ethnic Hispanics may have limited access to specialized care, such as mental health services or cancer treatment, due to cultural or linguistic barriers.
