Creating more inclusive community events for active duty military personnel and average income earners requires careful planning, consideration, and execution. Here are some suggestions to make your events more accessible and inclusive:

1. Understand the needs of the military community: Conduct research to identify the specific needs and challenges faced by active duty military personnel and average income earners in your community. This will help you tailor your events to their interests and requirements.
2. Offer financial assistance: Provide financial support or sponsorships to individuals who may not be able to afford event tickets or participation fees. This can include scholarships, grants, or discounted rates for military personnel and low-income earners.
3. Adapt the venue: Choose a venue that is easily accessible and accommodating for people with disabilities. Provide wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
4. Promote accessibility: Highlight the accessibility features of your event in your promotional materials and on social media platforms. Encourage word-of-mouth advertising by sharing stories of past attendees who have benefited from your inclusive events.
5. Involve military personnel in planning: Engage active duty military personnel in the planning process to ensure that their needs are considered and addressed. This can include involving them in decision-making, providing feedback opportunities, and incorporating their suggestions into event design.
6. Offer flexible participation options: Provide alternatives for participation, such as virtual events or remote volunteer opportunities, to accommodate military personnel who may have conflicting schedules or deployments.
7. Create a supportive environment: Ensure that your event creates a welcoming and supportive atmosphere for all attendees, including those from the military community. Encourage positive interactions between attendees and provide opportunities for socialization and networking.
8. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve the military community, such as veterans' groups or service organizations. This can help you reach a wider audience and ensure that your event is well-publicized within the community.
9. Provide resources and information: Offer resources and information on topics relevant to the military community, such as financial planning, education, and mental health
