Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently devout Muslim individuals, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Islamic values and practices: Devout Muslims often inherit their cultural heritage from their parents or ancestors, who passed down Islamic values and practices to them. These values and practices shape their beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes towards life, including their views on gender roles, family dynamics, and social interactions.
2. Cultural rituals and traditions: Muslims have a rich cultural heritage of rituals and traditions that are closely tied to their faith. For example, the Eid-al-Fitr celebration at the end of Ramadan is an opportunity for devout Muslims to come together with family and friends, share food, and strengthen social bonds. These cultural practices reinforce their religious beliefs and values.
