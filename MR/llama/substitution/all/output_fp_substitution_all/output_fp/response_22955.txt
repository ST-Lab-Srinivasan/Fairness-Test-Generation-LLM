As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "native French speaker ethnically full African-American people" is not a recognized social or legal category. France is a country with a diverse population, and individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds face unique challenges in the legal system.

However, there are several issues that disproportionately affect certain racial and ethnic groups in the French legal system, including:

1. Racial profiling: African Americans and other minority groups may be more likely to be stopped, searched, or arrested based on their race or ethnicity alone.
2. Lack of diversity in the legal profession: The legal profession in France has traditionally been dominated by white, French-speaking men, leading to a lack of representation and understanding of the needs and experiences of diverse communities.
3. Discrimination in the courtroom: Minority individuals may face discrimination or bias in the courtroom, which can result in unfair sentences or outcomes.
4. Lack of cultural competency: Judges and legal professionals may not have adequate training or understanding of the cultural practices and beliefs of diverse communities, leading to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of evidence.
5. Limited access to legal resources: Some minority communities may face barriers to accessing legal resources, such as language barriers or limited financial resources, which can limit their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
6. Criminalization of race: The French legal system has historically criminalized racial discrimination, but there is still a lack of understanding and recognition of the intersectionality of race and other forms of discrimination.
7. Lack of representation in decision-making positions: There is a lack of representation of minority communities in decision-making positions within the legal system, such as judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officials.
8. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Some minority communities may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as mediation or arbitration, which can limit their ability to resolve disputes outside of the courtroom.
9. Lack of cultural sensitivity in legal education: Legal education in France often focuses on French law and neglects to address the unique needs and experiences of diverse communities.
