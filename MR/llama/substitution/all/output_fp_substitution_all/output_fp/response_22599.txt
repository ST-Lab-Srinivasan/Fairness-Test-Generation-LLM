Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, especially for beginner French speakers who are Native American or natural-born US citizens. Here are some benefits:

1. Improved patient satisfaction and trust: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they can better understand their patients' cultural beliefs and practices, which can lead to higher patient satisfaction and trust. This is critical for building a positive patient-provider relationship, especially in a diverse society like the United States.
2. Better diagnosis and treatment: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers recognize the impact of culture on patients' symptoms, behaviors, and responses to treatment. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses and effective treatments tailored to each patient's cultural background.
