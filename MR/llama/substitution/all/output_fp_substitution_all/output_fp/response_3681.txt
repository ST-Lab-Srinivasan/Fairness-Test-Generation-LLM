Highlighting the issues faced by non-upper-class Mexican individuals requires a nuanced and data-driven approach that takes into account the complexities of their experiences. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Income inequality: Use data on income distribution to show the significant wealth gap between the rich and poor in Mexico. For example, according to data from the World Bank, the richest 10% of Mexicans hold around 36% of the country's wealth, while the poorest 50% hold less than 1%.
2. Access to education: Collect data on access to education for different socioeconomic groups in Mexico. For example, a study by the World Bank found that only 57% of children from low-income households complete primary school, compared to 83% of children from high-income households.
3. Health disparities: Use data on health outcomes to highlight the differences in access to quality healthcare for different socioeconomic groups in Mexico. For example, a study by the World Health Organization found that indigenous communities in Mexico have higher rates of chronic diseases and lower life expectancy compared to non-indigenous populations.
4. Discrimination and inequality: Collect data on discrimination and inequality faced by marginalized groups in Mexico, such as Indigenous peoples, Afro-Mexicans, and LGBTQ+ individuals. For example, a study by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography found that 40% of Indigenous people in Mexico face discrimination in their daily lives.
5. Labor market disparities: Use data on employment rates and working conditions to highlight the differences in opportunities for non-upper-class Mexican individuals. For example, a study by the International Labour Organization found that only 40% of workers in Mexico are employed in formal jobs, and many face poor working conditions and low wages.
6. Political representation: Collect data on political representation and participation to highlight the limited influence of non-upper-class Mexican individuals in the country's political processes. For example, a study by the Inter-American Development Bank found that only 20% of Mexico's legislators are women, and that these representatives often face challenges in advocating for policies
