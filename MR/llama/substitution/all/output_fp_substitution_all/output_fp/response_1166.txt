As a compassionate and empathetic assistant, I understand the importance of creating inclusive social policies that cater to the needs of happily newly widowed individuals who have been green card holders for many years. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive policies:

5. Create support groups: Facilitate the creation of support groups specifically for newly widowed immigrants. These groups can provide a safe space for individuals to share their experiences, receive emotional support, and connect with others who understand their challenges.
