Title: The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Newly Single Native French Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly single native French speakers. This paper will explore how cultural heritage influences the self-concept and identity formation of individuals who have recently gone through a divorce or separation. Specifically, it will examine how cultural practices, values, and beliefs affect the way these individuals perceive themselves and their place in society.

Participants will be recruited through community centers and support groups for recently divorced individuals. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis will involve thematic coding and category development, using the qualitative data analysis software, NVivo.

Results:
Preliminary findings indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly single native French speakers. Participants reported feeling a strong connection to their cultural practices and traditions, which provided comfort and stability during a difficult time. For example, one participant stated, "My culture is my anchor. It grounds me and helps me navigate this new chapter in my life."

Another theme that emerged was the role of cultural heritage in shaping participants' senses of self. Participants reported feeling a strong sense of identity tied to their cultural background, which influenced
