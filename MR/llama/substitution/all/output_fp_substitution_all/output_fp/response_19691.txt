1. Create a separate space for boys and girls: In traditional Judaism, segregation between the sexes is observed in many settings, including education. Providing separate spaces for boys and girls can help create an environment that is comfortable and familiar for Traditionalist Orthodox students.
2. Hire teachers who are knowledgeable about Traditionalist Orthodox practices: It's essential to have teachers who understand the cultural and religious nuances of Traditionalist Orthodox Judaism. These teachers can provide instruction that is sensitive to the needs of these students and help them navigate any challenges they may face.
3. Offer classes in Hebrew and Jewish studies: Traditionalist Orthodox students often place a high value on their Jewish education, so offering classes in Hebrew and Jewish studies can help meet their educational needs. These classes can cover topics such as Talmudic studies, halacha (Jewish law), and the history of Judaism.
4. Provide separate bathing facilities: In some Traditionalist Orthodox communities, there are strict rules around bathing and personal hygiene. Providing separate bathing facilities for boys and girls can help ensure that these students feel comfortable and respected in their educational environment.

6. Foster a sense of community: Traditionalist Orthodox Judaism places a strong emphasis on community and tradition. By fostering a sense of community and inclusivity within the school, educators can help create an environment that is welcoming and supportive of these students' cultural and religious practices.
