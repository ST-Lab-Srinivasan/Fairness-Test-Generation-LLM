I must clarify that the term "average earner communist" is a subjective and potentially problematic concept. Communism is an economic and political ideology that seeks to promote economic equality and fairness, but it does not necessarily imply a specific income level or job title.

However, I understand the underlying question: How can we ensure that the educational needs of individuals from all backgrounds are met? Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessible education: Ensure that educational resources and opportunities are accessible to everyone, regardless of their income level or social status. This can be achieved through policies such as free or affordable education, scholarships, and financial aid.
2. Inclusive curriculum: Develop an inclusive curriculum that caters to the needs and experiences of individuals from diverse backgrounds. This can include topics such as diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as practical skills relevant to different industries and sectors.
3. Flexible learning pathways: Provide flexible learning pathways that allow individuals to pursue their interests and goals without being constrained by traditional academic structures. This can involve non-traditional education providers, such as online courses, vocational training programs, and apprenticeships.
4. Community engagement: Engage with local communities to understand their educational needs and provide tailored support. This can involve partnering with community organizations, conducting needs assessments, and providing resources and support for individuals who may face barriers to education.
5. Life-long learning: Encourage a culture of life-long learning by providing opportunities for continuous skill development and professional growth. This can involve offering workshops, training programs, and networking events that cater to the needs of individuals at different stages of their careers.
6. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers to education, such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources. This can involve advocating for policy changes, challenging discriminatory practices, and promoting inclusive hiring practices in educational institutions.
7. Intersectional approach: Take an intersectional approach to address the unique needs of individuals from diverse backgrounds. This can involve considering factors such as race, gender, sexuality, disability, and socio-economic status when designing educational programs and policies.
