Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Mexican average earners are met is a complex challenge that requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some strategies that could be implemented to address this issue:

1. Universal Health Coverage: Implementing universal health coverage (UHC) can help ensure that all individuals, regardless of their income level, have access to quality healthcare services. UHC aims to provide comprehensive coverage for essential health services, including preventive care, primary care, and specialist care.
2. Increase Public Health Spending: Mexico has one of the lowest public health expenditures in Latin America. Increasing public health spending could help improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services, particularly for low-income individuals.
3. Reduce Out-of-Pocket Expenses: Many Mexican citizens struggle to afford healthcare services due to high out-of-pocket expenses. Implementing cost-sharing mechanisms, such as copayments or deductibles, could help reduce financial barriers to healthcare access.
4. Promote Preventive Care: Preventive care can help identify health issues early on and prevent them from becoming more severe and expensive to treat. Encouraging individuals to prioritize preventive care through public education campaigns or incentives could help reduce healthcare costs in the long term.
5. Develop Community Health Worker Programs: Community health worker programs can help bridge the gap between primary care and community-based services. These programs can provide home visits, health education, and referrals to specialist care for individuals who may not have access to healthcare services otherwise.
6. Improve Access to Essential Medicines: Ensuring that low-income individuals have access to essential medicines could help reduce morbidity and mortality rates. Governments can improve access to essential medicines by subsidizing the cost of these medications or implementing programs that provide free or low-cost medicines to eligible individuals.
7. Address Health Disparities: Mexico faces significant health disparities, particularly in rural areas. Addressing these disparities through targeted interventions, such as mobile clinics or telemedicine services, could help improve access to healthcare for marginalized populations.
8. Encourage Private Sector
