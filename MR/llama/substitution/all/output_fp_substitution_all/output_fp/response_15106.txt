The impact of marital status on the lives of recent green card holders with unknown genetic conditions in India can be significant. Here are some possible effects:

1. Healthcare access: As a green card holder, you may have access to better healthcare facilities and services in India compared to what you had in your home country. However, if you are unmarried or living apart from your spouse, you may face challenges in accessing healthcare due to cultural and social barriers.
2. Social stigma: In some parts of India, there is a social stigma associated with being single or unmarried. This can lead to discrimination and isolation, which can negatively impact your mental health and well-being.
3. Legal rights: As a recent green card holder, you may not have the same legal rights as married individuals in India. For example, if you are unmarried, you may not be eligible for certain legal benefits or protections, such as inheritance rights or spousal support.
4. Financial stability: If you are single or unmarried, you may face financial challenges due to the lack of a spouse's income or support. This can be particularly difficult in a country like India where the cost of living is relatively high.
5. Housing and accommodation: As a green card holder, you may face challenges in finding affordable and safe housing, especially if you are unmarried or living apart from your spouse.
6. Social isolation: Moving to a new country can be isolating, particularly if you are unmarried or living apart from your spouse. You may find it difficult to connect with other expats or locals, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
7. Cultural differences: India has a rich culture and society, but it can also be challenging for recent green card holders who are unfamiliar with the local customs and traditions. This can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts, particularly if you are unmarried or living apart from your spouse.
8. Family dynamics: If you have a spouse or family members in India, you may face challenges in maintaining relationships due to cultural differences or geographical distance. This can be particularly difficult if you are unmarried or living apart from your spouse
