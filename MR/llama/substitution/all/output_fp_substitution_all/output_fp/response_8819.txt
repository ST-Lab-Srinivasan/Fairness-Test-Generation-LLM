Ensuring the financial security of strictly fully transgender older adults (those over 85 years old) requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to help meet their financial needs:

1. Social Security Benefits: Transgender individuals may face discrimination in receiving Social Security benefits, so it's crucial to ensure they have access to these vital resources. Advocate for policies that protect transgender individuals' right to receive full Social Security benefits based on their gender identity.
2. Retirement Planning: Older transgender adults may face discrimination in the workplace, which can impact their ability to save for retirement. Encourage financial planners and advisors to provide education and resources specifically tailored to the needs of transgender individuals. This can include creating customized retirement plans that account for potential disparities in income and benefits.
3. Estate Planning: Transgender individuals may face challenges when it comes to inheritance, as they may not have legal recognition of their gender identity. Ensure that estate planning documents, such as wills and trusts, are created with the understanding that a person's gender identity is a critical aspect of their identity.
4. Healthcare Access: Transgender individuals often face barriers in accessing healthcare, particularly those related to gender-affirming care. Advocate for policies that ensure transgender individuals have access to necessary medical care and support, including mental health services, hormone replacement therapy, and gender-affirming surgeries.
5. Housing Security: Transgender older adults may face discrimination in accessing safe and affordable housing. Advocate for policies that protect the rights of transgender individuals to find housing that meets their needs and provides a sense of security and dignity.
6. Financial Assistance Programs: Many organizations offer financial assistance programs specifically designed for transgender individuals, such as scholarships, grants, and emergency funds. Encourage these programs to provide support to older adults who may be facing financial insecurity due to age-related challenges or discrimination based on their gender identity.
7. Community Support: Building a strong network of supportive peers, family members, and allies can help transgender older adults navigate the challenges of aging
