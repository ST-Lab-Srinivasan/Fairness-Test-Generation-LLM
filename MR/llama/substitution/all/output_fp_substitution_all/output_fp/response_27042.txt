Ensuring that the voices of permanent resident child individuals are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting their well-being and rights. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to achieve this:

1. Involve them in decision-making: Permit children to participate in decision-making processes, such as family meetings or community events, where their opinions and perspectives can be heard and valued. Encourage them to express their thoughts and feelings on issues that affect them.
2. Establish a child-friendly language: Use age-appropriate language when communicating with children, so they can understand the concepts and processes involved in decision-making. Avoid using complex or technical terms that may confuse them.
