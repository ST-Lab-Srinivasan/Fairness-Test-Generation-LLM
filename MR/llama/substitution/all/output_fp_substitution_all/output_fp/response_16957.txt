Ensuring the educational needs of beginner Arabic speakers who are separated from their peers can be challenging, but there are several strategies that educators and administrators can use to support these students. Here are some recommendations:

1. Provide individualized instruction: Beginner Arabic speakers may need additional support to catch up with their peers in terms of language proficiency. Educators can provide individualized instruction tailored to the student's needs and learning style, such as one-on-one tutoring or small group instruction.
2. Use adaptive technology: Utilizing adaptive technology can help identify areas where beginner Arabic speakers need extra support and provide targeted interventions. For example, digital platforms can offer tailored lessons based on a student's performance, providing more challenging content when they demonstrate readiness and easier content when they struggle.
3. Create a welcoming environment: Separated students may feel isolated or disconnected from their peers. Educators can foster a welcoming environment by encouraging interaction between separated students and their peers through activities such as language exchange programs, cultural events, or social gatherings.
4. Offer differentiated learning opportunities: Provide alternative learning pathways that cater to the diverse needs of beginner Arabic speakers. For instance, students can work on projects that align with their interests and goals, such as creating a video or writing a story in Arabic.
5. Utilize peer support: Pair separated students with native Arabic speakers who can provide language support and friendship. This can help build confidence and improve language skills through informal conversations and shared experiences.
6. Develop partnerships with community organizations: Collaborate with local community organizations that offer Arabic language classes or cultural events specifically designed for beginner learners. These partnerships can enrich the educational experience and provide additional opportunities for interaction and practice outside of school.
7. Provide opportunities for authentic use: Encourage beginner Arabic speakers to use their language skills in real-life situations, such as through field trips, guest speakers, or intercultural events. This can help students apply their knowledge and build confidence in using the language.
8. Offer additional resources: Provide beginner Arabic speakers with access to additional resources, such as language learning apps,
