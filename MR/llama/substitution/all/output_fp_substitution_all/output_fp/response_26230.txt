The impact of a person's military status on their life can be significant, particularly for those who are non-conservative or do not fit into the traditional military mold. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Non-conservative individuals in the military may face stigma and discrimination from their peers and superiors. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, which can affect their mental health and well-being.

This can limit their ability to advance in their careers and achieve their professional goals.
