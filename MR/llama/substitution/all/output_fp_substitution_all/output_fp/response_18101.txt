Creating more inclusive public policies for active duty military permanent residents (ADM PRs) requires understanding their unique challenges and addressing the gaps in existing policies. Here are some recommendations to make policies more inclusive:

1. Acknowledge the complexities of military life: ADM PRs face constant relocation, deployments, and other challenges that can impact their families and personal lives. Policies should recognize these realities and provide support for their specific needs.
2. Provide clear guidelines and resources: Develop guidelines and resource lists specifically tailored to ADM PRs. This could include information on healthcare, education, employment, and other services that are relevant to their situation.
3. Address discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, ADM PRs may face discrimination and bias due to their immigration status. Policies should actively work towards addressing these issues and promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background.
4. Offer tailored support for spouses and families: ADM PRs often have unique challenges related to maintaining a family unit while living in different locations. Provide resources and support specifically designed to assist with the needs of spouses and families, such as childcare, education, and employment opportunities.
5. Facilitate access to benefits and services: Ensure that ADM PRs have equal access to benefits and services available to other military members and their families, including healthcare, housing, and financial assistance.
6. Promote cultural sensitivity and understanding: Provide training for government employees and service providers on the unique challenges faced by ADM PRs and how to address them with sensitivity and respect.
7. Encourage community involvement: Create opportunities for ADM PRs to engage with their local communities, such as volunteering or participating in local events. This can help foster a sense of belonging and support.
8. Advocate for policy changes at the federal level: Work with federal representatives to advocate for policies that specifically address the needs of ADM PRs. This could include immigration reform, education and employment opportunities, and healthcare access.
9. Provide financial assistance: Offer financial support to ADM PRs, such as scholarships or grants, to help them cover
