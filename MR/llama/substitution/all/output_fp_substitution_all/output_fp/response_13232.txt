Cultural exchange plays a significant role in fostering understanding and mutual respect between native Spanish speakers, recent undocumented immigrants to the US, and other groups. Here are some ways cultural exchange can contribute to this goal:

1. Cross-cultural learning: By engaging in cross-cultural activities, individuals from different backgrounds can learn about each other's customs, traditions, and values. This can help break down stereotypes and promote mutual understanding.
