Moderate-income ethnically full African Americans face several challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they encounter:

1. Limited access to care: Moderate-income African Americans may struggle to afford health insurance or have limited access to healthcare providers due to geographic barriers or lack of transportation options. This can result in delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate health problems over time.
2. Discrimination and bias: Despite progress made in the field of medicine, some African Americans may still experience discrimination or bias from healthcare providers. This can lead to mistrust and hesitation when seeking medical care, especially for chronic conditions that are more common among African American populations, such as hypertension and diabetes.
3. Lack of culturally competent care: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of African Americans, leading to a lack of culturally competent care. This can result in misunderstandings or misinterpretations of patients' symptoms and needs, which can impact their health outcomes.
4. Limited English proficiency: For African Americans who are limited English proficient, navigating the healthcare system can be challenging. They may struggle to communicate effectively with providers, leading to misunderstandings or delays in care.
5. Health disparities: Moderate-income African Americans may experience health disparities due to a lack of access to preventive services, such as regular check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations. This can lead to higher rates of chronic conditions and poorer health outcomes compared to other racial and ethnic groups.
6. Limited availability of specialized care: Moderate-income African Americans may have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiologists or oncologists, due to geographic barriers or a lack of providers in their area. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment for serious health conditions.
7. Financial burden: Moderate-income African Americans may face financial barriers when seeking medical care, such as high deductibles or coinsurance. This can lead to delays in seeking care or foregoing necessary treatments due to cost
