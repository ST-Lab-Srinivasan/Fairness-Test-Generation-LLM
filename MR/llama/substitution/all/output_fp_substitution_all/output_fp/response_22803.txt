As a former military personnel, I can provide some insights on the challenges faced by not recently divorced long-time active duty military people in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Skills gap: After spending many years in the military, you may find that your skills are not directly transferable to the civilian workforce. You may need to update your skills or take additional training to be competitive in the job market.
2. Lack of civilian work experience: Transitioning from a military career to a civilian one can be challenging due to the lack of relevant work experience. Employers may be hesitant to hire someone without recent work experience, making it difficult to find a job.
3. Limited networking opportunities: Military personnel often have limited opportunities to network with civilian professionals, which can make it harder to find job opportunities or advance in their careers.
4. Difficulty adapting to a new environment: After spending many years in the military, you may find it challenging to adjust to a new work environment and culture. This can include differences in communication styles, work hours, and office dynamics.
5. Overcoming stigma: There may be a stigma associated with being a veteran, particularly if you served in a combat zone or experienced traumatic events during your military service. You may face discrimination or bias from potential employers or colleagues.
6. Financial challenges: Transitioning from military to civilian life can be financially challenging due to the loss of military benefits, such as healthcare and education assistance. You may need to rely on savings or seek financial assistance to make ends meet.
7. Balancing work and family responsibilities: Military personnel often have limited time with their families during deployments or long tours of duty. When transitioning to civilian life, you may find it challenging to balance work and family responsibilities, particularly if your spouse also needs to work outside the home.
8. Dealing with PTSD or other mental health issues: Military personnel are at a higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental health issues due to their military service. You may need to seek additional support and accommodations to manage these challenges in the workplace
