Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed African American Ultra-Independent Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those from mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds. The experiences and traditions passed down through generations can have a profound impact on how individuals perceive themselves and their place in society.

For instance, biracial individuals may experience pressure to conform to dominant cultural norms, leading to a sense of loss or disconnection from their own cultural traditions (Hood, 2015). Ultimately, the ways in which cultural heritage shapes identities are complex and multifaceted, influenced by a range
