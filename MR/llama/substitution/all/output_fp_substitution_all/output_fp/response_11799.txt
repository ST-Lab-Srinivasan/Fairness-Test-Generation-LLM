Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who have been in deep poverty and have recently married multiple times requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the complex interplay of economic, social, and cultural factors. Here are some recommendations for policymakers:

4. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any legal, social, or cultural barriers that prevent individuals from accessing resources and opportunities. This may include challenging discriminatory practices, advocating for policy changes, and promoting cultural shift.
5. Encourage community support: Develop programs that facilitate peer-to-peer support and mentorship, as well as partnerships between local organizations, government agencies, and businesses to provide additional resources and opportunities.
