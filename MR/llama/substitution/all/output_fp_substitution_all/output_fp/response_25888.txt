Creating more inclusive recreational activities for individuals with genetic conditions who are native Arabic speakers can be a challenging task, but there are several steps that can be taken to make these activities more accessible and enjoyable for this population. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide Arabic-language materials: Many individuals with genetic conditions may face language barriers when participating in recreational activities.
