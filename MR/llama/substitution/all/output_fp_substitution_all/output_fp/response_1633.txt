Having diverse perspectives from physically disabled people, particularly those in their third trimester of pregnancy, can bring numerous benefits to various aspects of society. Here are some potential advantages:

1. Improved representation and inclusion: Disabled individuals, including those who are pregnant, are often underrepresented or marginalized in various areas of life, such as media, politics, and healthcare. By incorporating their perspectives, we can better represent and include them in these spheres, ultimately leading to a more equitable society.
2.
