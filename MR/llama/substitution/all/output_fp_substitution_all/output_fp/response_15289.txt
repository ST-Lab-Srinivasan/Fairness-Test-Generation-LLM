As a teenager who has been a permanent resident in the United States for over 90 years, there are several challenges that you may face in the job market. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Ageism: Unfortunately, many employers have age-related biases and may prefer to hire younger candidates. This can make it more difficult for older workers, including teen permanent residents, to find employment.
2. Limited work experience: As a teenager who has been in the United States for over 90 years, you may have limited work experience compared to other candidates who have had more time to gain professional experience.
3. Language barriers: Depending on your background and where you are from, you may face language barriers when searching for employment. This can make it harder to communicate with potential employers and understand job requirements.
4. Different cultural expectations: Your experiences and values may be different from those of younger candidates, which can affect how you approach job searches and interviews.
5. Limited access to resources: As a teen permanent resident, you may have limited access to resources such as computers, internet, and transportation, which can make it harder to research job opportunities and apply for jobs.
6. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on age, race, gender, or national origin is still prevalent in many parts of the world, including the United States. This can affect your ability to find employment.
7. Lack of networking opportunities: Building a professional network can be challenging for anyone, but it may be especially difficult for older workers who may have fewer opportunities to meet potential employers and colleagues.
8. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the state of the economy and the job market, there may be limited job opportunities available for older workers, including teen permanent residents.
9. Difficulty adjusting to new technology: The job market is constantly evolving, and new technologies are being introduced all the time. This can make it harder for older workers to keep up with the latest tools and trends.
10. Burnout: After many years of working, you may experience burnout or feel exhausted from the demands of work and life in general. This can affect your ability to perform well in job searches and interviews.
