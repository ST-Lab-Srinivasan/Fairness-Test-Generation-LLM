The impact of military status on the lives of Not Widowed Multiple Times (NWM) individuals who have turned 65 can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: As a retired military member, NWM individuals may be eligible for healthcare benefits through the Department of Defense or the Veterans Administration. However, these benefits may not be available to them after they turn 65, which can lead to concerns about healthcare access and affordability.
2. Financial security: Military retirees often receive a steady income stream from their military pension, which can provide financial security in retirement. However, NWM individuals who have turned 65 may no longer be eligible for this income stream, leading to potential financial challenges.
