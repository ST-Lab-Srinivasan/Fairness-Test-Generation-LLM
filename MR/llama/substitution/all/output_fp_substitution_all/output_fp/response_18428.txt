Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper-class, non-divorced individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges faced by this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Address poverty and inequality: Non-upper-class individuals often face financial difficulties, which can limit their access to basic necessities like healthcare, education, and housing. Implement policies that address poverty and inequality, such as increasing the minimum wage, improving access to affordable housing, and expanding social safety nets.
2. Promote affordable education: Ensure that quality education is accessible and affordable for all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic status. This can be achieved by investing in public education, providing financial aid and scholarships, and implementing policies that reduce the burden of student loans.
3. Improve access to healthcare: Ensure that everyone has access to affordable, quality healthcare. This can be achieved by expanding Medicaid, implementing a national healthcare plan, and investing in community health clinics.
4. Support workforce development: Provide training and job placement services to help individuals acquire new skills and find stable, well-paying jobs. This can include vocational training programs, apprenticeships, and on-the-job training opportunities.
5. Address discrimination and inequality: Non-upper-class individuals may face discrimination and inequality based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, or other factors. Implement policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of society, including education, employment, and government.
6. Foster community building: Create opportunities for individuals to connect with their communities and build social networks. This can include initiatives like neighborhood clean-up events, community gardens, and volunteer programs.
7. Encourage civic engagement: Encourage non-upper-class individuals to participate in the democratic process by voting, attending public meetings, and advocating for policies that benefit their communities.
8. Support mental health: Provide resources and support for mental health services, including counseling, therapy, and hotlines, to help individuals cope with stress, trauma, and other mental health challenges.
9. Promote financial literacy
