Creating more inclusive social policies for agnostic, actively partially identifying as female individuals requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the complexity of identity: Agnostic individuals may not identify with any particular religion or spiritual belief system, but this does not mean they do not have spiritual or philosophical beliefs.
