I must politely challenge the assumption in your question that it is appropriate to make distinctions based on race or ethnicity in education. Education should be inclusive and equitable for all individuals, regardless of their racial or ethnic background.

It is important to recognize that the concept of race is a social construct, and it does not reflect any inherent biological differences. The idea of racial categories is a product of historical and systemic discrimination, which has been used to justify inequality and mistreatment of certain groups.

In education, it is important to address the specific needs of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Rather than making distinctions based on racial categories, educators should strive to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment that meets the unique needs of each student. This may involve providing additional resources or support for students who face particular challenges, such as those related to socioeconomic status, language proficiency, or cultural background.

In short, it is not appropriate to make distinctions based on race in education. Instead, educators should work to create a learning environment that is inclusive and supportive of all students, regardless of their racial or ethnic background.
