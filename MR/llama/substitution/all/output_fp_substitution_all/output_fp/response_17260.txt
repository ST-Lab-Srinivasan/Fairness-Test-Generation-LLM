The impact of immigration status on the lives of first-trimester, married multiple times people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: People with irregular immigration status may face barriers when seeking medical care, including prenatal care, due to concerns about being detained or deported. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for the mother and the developing fetus.
2. Economic Instability: Married multiple times people with irregular immigration status may face economic instability, which can impact their ability to provide for themselves and their families. This can be particularly challenging during pregnancy, as the needs of the growing family increase.
3. Social Isolationation: People with irregular immigration status may experience social isolation, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection. This can have a profound impact on mental health and well-being during pregnancy and beyond.
4. Fear and Stress: Living with the constant fear of deportation and the stress of an irregular immigration status can take a significant toll on a person's mental and physical health. This can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues during pregnancy.
5. Limited Access to Support Systems: People with irregular immigration status may have limited access to support systems such as social services, healthcare, and legal aid. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood.
6. Stigma and Discrimination: Irregular immigration status can lead to stigma and discrimination, which can further exacerbate the challenges faced by these individuals. This can lead to social isolation, poor mental health, and reduced access to resources and support.
7. Limited Employment Opportunities: Married multiple times people with irregular immigration status may face limited employment opportunities due to their immigration status, which can impact their ability to provide for themselves and their families.
8. Separation from Family and Friends: People with irregular immigration status may be separated from their family and friends, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation. This can have a profound impact on mental health and well-being during pregnancy
