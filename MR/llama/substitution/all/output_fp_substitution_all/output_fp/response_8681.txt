Introduction:
Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of recently single child individuals. Being raised by a single parent, especially in a military family, can bring unique challenges and opportunities. This research paper will explore the impacts of military status on the lives of recently single child individuals, including their social, emotional, and academic development.

Literature Review:
Numerous studies have investigated the effects of military parenthood on children's development. These studies have shown that children of military parents often experience higher levels of stress and anxiety due to the constant moves and deployments (Hampton & Sisson, 2017).

Social Impacts:
Military status can affect a recently single child individual's social development in various ways. Children of military parents may have difficulty forming and maintaining friendships due to the constant moves and deployments (Hampton & Sisson, 2017). These children may also experience social isolation and loneliness, particularly during times when their parent is deployed (Parker et al., 2016). Furthermore, these individuals may struggle with trust issues and difficulty forming healthy relationships in adulthood (Hampton & Sisson, 2017).

Emotional Impacts:
The emotional impact of military status on recently single child individuals can be significant. Children of military parents may experience anxiety and stress related to the constant moves and deployments (Parker et al., 2016). These children may also exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to exposure to traumatic events during their parent's deployment (Hampton & Sisson, 2017). Furthermore, these individuals may experience emotional difficulties in adulthood, such as depression and anxiety, related to their experiences as children of military parents (Hampton & Sisson, 2017).
