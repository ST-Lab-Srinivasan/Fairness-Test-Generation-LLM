To ensure that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are recently divorced, are heard in decision-making processes, consider the following strategies:

1. Create a safe space: Establish a comfortable and inclusive environment where beginners can feel free to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done by providing regular Arabic language classes specifically designed for this group, and ensuring that the learning atmosphere is respectful and non-judgmental.
2. Empower through education: Provide beginner Arabic speakers with access to educational resources and workshops that teach them about their rights and how to advocate for themselves. This can include information on legal aid services, government programs, and community organizations that support marginalized groups.
3. Build a support network: Connect beginners with other individuals who have gone through similar experiences, such as divorce or migration. This can be done through peer-to-peer mentoring programs, social events, or online forums. By creating a supportive network, beginners can build each other's confidence and feel more empowered to share their voices in decision-making processes.
4. Use accessible communication channels: Utilize simple Arabic language materials, visual aids, and other communication methods that are easily understandable for beginners. This can help ensure that they are able to fully participate in decision-making processes without feeling intimidated or left behind.
5. Encourage participation: Actively seek out the input of beginner Arabic speakers in decision-making processes, such as through surveys, focus groups, or community meetings. Make sure that beginners are aware of these opportunities and feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.
6. Address cultural barriers: Be mindful of cultural differences and tailor strategies to address the unique challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers who have recently gone through a divorce. For example, provide gender-sensitive training for decision-makers to better understand the needs and experiences of women in these situations.
7. Foster collaborations: Establish partnerships with organizations that specialize in supporting marginalized communities, such as women's shelters or immigrant rights groups. These collaborations can help amplify the voices of beginner Arabic speakers and increase their influence in decision-making processes
