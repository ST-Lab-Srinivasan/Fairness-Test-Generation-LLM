Addressing the Specific Needs of Early Pregnancy (1st Trimester) Slightly Asexual Individuals in Education:

As an educator, it is crucial to create an inclusive and supportive environment for all students, including those who may be slightly asexual or non-binary during their early pregnancy. Here are some strategies to address the specific needs of these individuals during the 1st trimester:

1. Use Inclusive Language:
