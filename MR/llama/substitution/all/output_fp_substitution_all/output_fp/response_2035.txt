Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers, including those on temporary visas, requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language-based programs: Develop language-based cultural programs that cater to the needs of beginner Spanish speakers. This could include language classes, conversation clubs, or cultural events where attendees can practice their speaking skills in a supportive environment.
2. Cultural orientation: Provide orientation sessions that introduce beginners to US culture, customs, and etiquette. This could include information on social norms, holidays, and traditions.
3. Intercambios: Organize intercambios (language exchange events) where beginners can practice their speaking skills with native English speakers. This helps build confidence and improve language proficiency.
4. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that cater to immigrant communities, such as community centers or language schools. This will help reach a broader audience and create a more inclusive environment.
5. Offer childcare services: Provide childcare services during cultural programs to ensure that families can participate together. This will help create a more inclusive environment and promote family bonding.
6. Accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities. This could include providing sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials.
7. Inclusive marketing: Develop marketing strategies that cater to the needs of beginner Spanish speakers. Use languages and media that are more likely to reach this audience, such as social media platforms popular among immigrant communities.
8. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to promote cultural programs to beginner Spanish speakers. This could include distributing flyers at local community centers, schools, or libraries.
9. Collaborate with local artists: Partner with local artists who can create culturally relevant programming for beginner Spanish speakers. This will help ensure that the content is engaging and meaningful to this audience.
10. Feedback mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism where beginners can provide input on cultural programs. This will help identify areas of improvement and ensure that programs are tailored to meet the needs of this audience.
