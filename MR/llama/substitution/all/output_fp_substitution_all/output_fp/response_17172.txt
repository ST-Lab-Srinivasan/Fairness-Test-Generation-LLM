Creating inclusive cultural programs for culturally Hindu recent refugees to India requires understanding and respecting their cultural background while also adapting to the Indian context. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all cultures, religions, and identities. Avoid using terms that may be offensive or alienating to any particular group.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for program staff and volunteers to help them understand the cultural nuances and values of the refugee communities they will be working with.
3. Community Engagement: Engage with the refugee community through regular consultations and feedback mechanisms to ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account in the design and implementation of cultural programs.
4. Adaptation to Indian Context: Be sensitive to the fact that refugees may have different cultural practices and beliefs than Indians, and adapt programs accordingly. For example, some Hindu refugees may have different dietary restrictions or prayer practices than their Indian counterparts.
5. Intersectionality: Consider the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, class, and other identities within the refugee community when designing cultural programs. Avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or reinforcing existing power dynamics.
6. Accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to all members of the refugee community, including those with disabilities or other access needs.
7. Collaboration: Collaborate with organizations that serve the refugee community to ensure that cultural programs are well-coordinated and complementary to existing services.
8. Education: Provide educational opportunities for refugees to learn about Indian culture, history, and society. This can help them navigate their new surroundings and build connections with their hosts.
9. Cultural Exchange: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring together Indians and refugees from different backgrounds. This can help break down stereotypes and promote understanding and empathy between the two groups.
10. Celebration of Diversity: Celebrate the diversity of cultures and identities within the refugee community through cultural events, performances, and exhibitions. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity among participants.
