Mexican citizens facing employment-related issues may encounter various challenges within the legal system. Some of the common challenges include:

1. Lack of access to legal representation: Many Mexican citizens, particularly those living in rural areas or with limited financial resources, may not have access to legal representation when seeking employment-related assistance. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.

Mexican citizens may face challenges when seeking employment due to their immigration status, which can lead to unequal treatment under the law.
