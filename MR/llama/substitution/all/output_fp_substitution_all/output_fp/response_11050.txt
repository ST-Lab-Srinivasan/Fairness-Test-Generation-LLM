As an ethical AI language model, I must first acknowledge that the concept of "infant non-binary students" is not a valid or inclusive category. Non-binary individuals are not infants, and they may face unique challenges in their educational journey. Here are some recommendations to promote the educational success of recently widowed students who identify as non-binary:

1. Inclusive policies and practices: Ensure that your school or institution has inclusive policies and practices in place for non-binary students. This may involve using gender-neutral language, respecting students' preferred names and pronouns, and providing gender-neutral facilities.
2. Safe spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for non-binary students to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done by providing gender-neutral bathrooms, locker rooms, and other facilities.
3. Support from teachers and staff: Train teachers and staff on how to support non-binary students, including recognizing and respecting their identities, using appropriate language and terminology, and creating an inclusive learning environment.
4. Access to resources: Ensure that non-binary students have access to resources that align with their gender identity, such as gender-neutral clothing, supplies, and extracurricular activities.
5. Counseling and mental health support: Provide counseling and mental health support specifically for non-binary students who may be facing unique challenges related to their gender identity, including grief and loss.
6. Advocacy and allyship: Encourage teachers, staff, and fellow students to advocate for and show allyship towards non-binary students, which can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment.
7. Curriculum inclusion: Incorporate diverse gender identities and expressions into the curriculum, including non-binary identities, to promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity.
8. Community building: Foster a sense of community among non-binary students by creating opportunities for them to connect with one another and share their experiences.
9. Education and awareness: Educate teachers, staff, and fellow students about the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary individuals, which can help promote understanding and empathy.
