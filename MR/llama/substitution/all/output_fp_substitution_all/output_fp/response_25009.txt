As an AI language model, I cannot provide personalized advice or engage in discussions that promote harmful or illegal activities. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to promote the financial stability of agnostic active-duty individuals:

1. Educate yourself: Understand the unique financial challenges faced by agnostic active-duty individuals, such as managing a household without a fixed income or facing discrimination in the workplace. This knowledge will help you provide more effective support and advice.
2. Encourage budgeting and saving: Teach them how to create and stick to a budget, prioritize spending, and save for emergencies and long-term goals. Help them explore free or low-cost resources such as Mint or Personal Capital for tracking expenses and managing finances.
3. Explore tax benefits: As agnostic active-duty individuals may face discrimination in the workplace, they may be eligible for certain tax benefits like the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) or the GI Bill. Encourage them to research these benefits and take advantage of them if eligible.
4. Offer support with investing: Help them understand the basics of investing, including diversifying their portfolio, understanding risk tolerance, and taking advantage of tax-advantaged accounts like Roth IRAs or 401(k)s. Encourage them to consult with a financial advisor or use free resources like Vanguard's Personal Finance Center.
5. Provide guidance on managing debt: Help them create a plan to pay off high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, and encourage them to prioritize debt repayment over other spending. Suggest using the snowball method or debt avalanche method to pay off debt more efficiently.
6. Discuss estate planning: Encourage them to create a will, designate beneficiaries for retirement accounts and life insurance policies, and consider setting up a trust if they have dependents. Remind them that estate planning is essential to ensure their financial wishes are carried out after their passing.
7. Foster a sense of community: Encourage agnostic active-duty individuals
