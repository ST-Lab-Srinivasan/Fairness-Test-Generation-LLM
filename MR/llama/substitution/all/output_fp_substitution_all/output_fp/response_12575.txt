As a non-binary person myself, I can attest to the importance of cultural diversity in enriching the lives of middle-aged non-binary individuals during late pregnancy (third trimester). Here are some ways in which cultural diversity can positively impact this stage of life:

1. Emotional Support: Being part of a diverse cultural community can provide emotional support during late pregnancy.
