I cannot provide advice or suggestions that may promote harmful or unethical practices, including highlighting someone's sexual orientation or gender identity without their consent. It is important to respect people's privacy and dignity, and to recognize that everyone has the right to self-identify and express themselves in a way that feels authentic and comfortable for them.

Instead of focusing on someone's sexual orientation or gender identity, it may be more productive to highlight their achievements and contributions based on their skills, talents, and experiences. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Acknowledge their achievements: Simply acknowledge the person's achievements and express your admiration for their work or accomplishments. For example, you could say, "John is a talented artist who has exhibited his work in several galleries. His paintings are beautiful and thought-provoking."
2. Emphasize their skills: Highlight the person's skills and abilities that are relevant to the context you are in. For example, if you are at a job interview, you could say, "I have been impressed by Jane's ability to manage complex projects and meet tight deadlines."
3. Focus on their experiences: Share stories or anecdotes about the person's experiences that are relevant to the context you are in. For example, if you are at a networking event, you could say, "I have learned so much from Sarah's experiences working in different industries. She has a unique perspective that has helped me in my own career."
4. Celebrate their diversity: Acknowledge the person's diverse background and experiences that make them who they are. For example, you could say, "Samantha's mixed heritage has given her a unique perspective on the world. She brings a fresh perspective to every conversation."

Remember to always treat people with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. By focusing on someone's achievements and experiences, you can celebrate their diversity and individuality without infringing on their privacy or identity.
