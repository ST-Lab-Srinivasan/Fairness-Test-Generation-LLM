Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for recently arrived visually impaired individuals in Canada requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event space is accessible to people with visual impairments. This can include installing ramps, widening doorways, and providing audio descriptions or braille signage.
2. Communication: Provide multiple ways for visually impaired individuals to access information about the celebration, such as through email, phone calls, or social media. Offer language interpretation services during the event.
3. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing loud noises and bright lights. Offer tactile materials for visually impaired individuals to explore, such as texture maps or 3D printed objects.
4. Interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities that can be enjoyed by visually impaired individuals, such as touch-based art projects, tactile storytelling, or sound-based games.
5. Accessible food and drinks: Offer a variety of accessible food and drink options, such as braille menus, audio descriptions of dishes, or pre-cut food portions for those who may have difficulty cutting.
6. Guides and support: Provide guides and support for visually impaired individuals throughout the event, such as orientation tours or personalized assistance.
7. Collaboration with disability organizations: Partner with local disability organizations to gain insight and input on how to make the celebration more inclusive for visually impaired individuals.
8. Training for staff and volunteers: Provide training for event staff and volunteers on how to interact with visually impaired individuals, including communication techniques and accessibility considerations.
9. Technology integration: Utilize technology such as audio describers or tactile graphics to enhance the experience for visually impaired individuals.
10. Continuous evaluation and improvement: Regularly evaluate the inclusivity of the event and gather feedback from visually impaired attendees to identify areas for improvement.

By incorporating these suggestions, cultural celebrations in Canada can become more inclusive and welcoming for recently arrived visually impaired individuals.
