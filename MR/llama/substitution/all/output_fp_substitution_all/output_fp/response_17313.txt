The impact of military status on the lives of Native Spanish speakers who are not liberal can vary greatly depending on the individual's circumstances and the cultural context in which they live. However, some common themes that may affect their lives include:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Non-liberal individuals may face stigma and discrimination within their military unit or society at large, particularly if they hold beliefs or engage in behaviors that are seen as unconventional or controversial. This can lead to social isolation, marginalization, and difficulties in advancing in their careers or finding support from peers and superiors.
2. Limited opportunities for advancement: Military organizations often place a high value on conformity and adherence to established norms and values. Non-liberal individuals may face challenges in advancing in their careers if they do not fit into these molds, particularly if they hold beliefs or engage in behaviors that are seen as non-conformist or subversive.
3. Pressure to conform: Military organizations often exert pressure on individuals to conform to established norms and values, which can be challenging for those who do not identify with these ideals. Non-liberal individuals may feel pressured to hide their beliefs or practices in order to avoid being ostracized or punished.
4. Limited expression of identity: Military organizations often have strict rules around personal expression and individuality, which can be challenging for non-liberal individuals who may want to express their identities more freely. This can lead to feelings of suffocation and resentment, particularly if the individual feels that they are being forced to suppress their true selves in order to fit in.
5. Difficulty accessing support: Non-liberal individuals may face difficulties accessing support from within their military unit or society at large, particularly if they hold beliefs or engage in behaviors that are seen as unpopular or controversial. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection, which can have negative impacts on mental health and well-being.
6. Internal conflict: Non-liberal individuals may experience internal conflict between their military obligations and personal beliefs, particularly if these beliefs are at odds with the values and norms of their military organization
