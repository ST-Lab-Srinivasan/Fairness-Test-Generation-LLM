Protecting the legal rights of single, long-time active duty military individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects of their lives. Here are some ways to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Family Law Reform: The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) provides protections for former military spouses in divorce proceedings. However, this act does not apply to single, long-time active duty service members who have never been married. Advocating for reforms in family law to provide equal protection and support for these individuals is crucial.
2. Estate Planning: Many single, long-time active duty military individuals may not have had the opportunity to establish a comprehensive estate plan due to frequent moves or deployments.

This includes providing them with information on free or low-cost legal clinics and resources, as well as connecting them with attorneys who specialize in military law.
7. Advocacy for Service Members' Rights: Advocating for policies and laws that protect the legal rights of single, long-time active duty military individuals is essential. This includes supporting legislation that provides equal protection under the law and
