Lower-income natural-born Canadian citizen people may face a number of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Lower-income individuals may not have the financial means to access legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid services, or online legal platforms. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
2. Barriers to justice: Lower-income individuals may face barriers to accessing justice, including language barriers, lack of transportation, and limited access to legal clinics and other resources.
3. Discrimination: Lower-income individuals may face discrimination in the legal system, including racialized or gendered discrimination, which can affect their ability to access justice.
4. Lack of legal representation: Lower-income individuals may not have access to legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
5. Limited understanding of the legal system: Lower-income individuals may have a limited understanding of the legal system and the processes involved, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the system effectively.
6. Lack of trust in the legal system: Lower-income individuals may lack trust in the legal system due to past experiences or perceptions of bias or unfairness, which can affect their ability to access justice.
7. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Lower-income individuals may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation or arbitration, which can be less expensive and less time-consuming than going to court.
8. Lack of legal literacy: Lower-income individuals may have a lack of legal literacy, which can make it difficult for them to understand their rights and obligations under the law.
9. Limited access to legal aid services: Lower-income individuals may have limited access to legal aid services, which can provide free or low-cost legal assistance to those who cannot afford it.
10. Lack of connection to the legal system: Lower-income individuals may feel disconnected from the legal system and may not see the value in seeking legal advice or assistance, which can affect their ability to access justice.
