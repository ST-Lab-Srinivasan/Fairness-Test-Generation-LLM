As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "libertarian" is often associated with political beliefs and values that may not be applicable or relevant to all individuals or groups. Additionally, the concept of "native Chinese speaker" can be complex and nuanced, as China has a diverse population with multiple ethnic and linguistic groups.

That being said, there are certainly challenges faced by people from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds within the legal system, including those who speak non-standard forms of Chinese or who have limited proficiency in Standard Mandarin. These challenges can include:

1. Language barriers: Non-Standard Chinese speakers may face difficulties communicating with legal professionals who only speak Standard Mandarin, potentially leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
2. Cultural differences: People from different cultural backgrounds may have different expectations and values when interacting with the legal system, which can lead to confusion or frustration if these expectations are not met.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Non-Standard Chinese speakers may have limited access to legal resources, such as legal aid organizations or language interpretation services, which can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
4. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a long history of bias and discrimination against marginalized groups within the legal system, including those who speak non-Standard forms of Chinese. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and may discourage these individuals from seeking legal recourse.
5. Lack of representation: Non-Standard Chinese speakers may have limited access to legal representation, particularly if they cannot find an attorney who speaks their language or understands their cultural background. This can lead to a lack of understanding of their rights and options within the legal system.

To address these challenges, it is important to promote greater diversity and inclusivity within the legal profession, including increasing the number of attorneys who are fluent in non-Standard Chinese dialects and cultural competency training for legal professionals. Additionally, providing language interpretation services and legal aid organizations can help ensure that all individuals have access to justice, regardless of their cultural or linguistic background.
