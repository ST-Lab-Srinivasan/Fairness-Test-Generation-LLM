Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, particularly for serving the needs of diverse populations, including Native American communities. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for active-duty Native natural-born US citizen people:

1. Improved health outcomes: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they are better equipped to understand the unique needs and experiences of Native American communities. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses, effective treatment plans, and improved health outcomes for patients.
2. Increased trust and rapport: Cultural competence helps build trust and rapport between healthcare providers and their patients. When patients feel understood and respected, they are more likely to adhere to treatment plans and participate in their own care.
3. Better communication: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent understand the importance of communication in healthcare. They are able to ask culturally sensitive questions, listen actively, and provide clear instructions that are tailored to the patient's cultural background.

6. Greater access to care: Cultural competence can help remove barriers to healthcare access for Native American communities. By understanding the cultural nuances of these populations, healthcare providers can provide more effective outreach and engagement strategies, leading to greater access to care.
7. Improved collaboration with community organizations: Cultural competence can facilitate collaboration between healthcare providers and community-based organizations that serve Native American communities. This can lead to more comprehensive and effective care for patients.
8. Increased cultural awareness: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent have a deeper understanding of the cultural practices, beliefs, and values of their patients. This awareness can help them provide more tailored care and better address the unique needs of these populations.
