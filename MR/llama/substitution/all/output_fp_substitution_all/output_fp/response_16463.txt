Creating more inclusive community programs for active-duty newly divorced individuals requires understanding their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions to help build a supportive community:

1. Identify the needs of newly divorced service members: Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather information on the specific challenges that newly divorced service members face, such as navigating military bureaucracy, managing finances, finding affordable housing, and coping with emotional stress.
2. Provide financial assistance: Offer financial aid, such as emergency loans or grants, to help newly divorced service members cover essential expenses during this transition period. This can include paying for housing, utilities, food, and other living costs.
3. Create support groups: Facilitate regular support groups where newly divorced service members can connect with others going through similar experiences. These groups can provide a safe space to share stories, ask questions, and offer emotional support.
4. Offer mental health resources: Provide access to mental health professionals who are trained in working with military personnel and their families. This can include individual counseling sessions, group therapy, or telemedicine services.
5. Develop co-parenting workshops: Offer workshops that provide guidance on how to navigate the complexities of co-parenting while serving in the military. This can include communication strategies, conflict resolution techniques, and legal considerations.
6. Provide childcare resources: Offer information and referrals for affordable childcare options, such as on-base childcare centers or off-base providers. This can help reduce stress and financial burdens for newly divorced service members.
7. Facilitate social events: Organize social events that bring together newly divorced service members and their families. This can help build a sense of community and connection, which is crucial during this challenging time.
8. Collaborate with other organizations: Partner with local non-profits, community groups, or religious organizations to offer additional resources and support to newly divorced service members.
9. Advocate for policy changes: Work with military leaders and policymakers to address the unique challenges faced by newly divorced service members. This can include advocating for more flexible deployment schedules, improved financial assistance programs
