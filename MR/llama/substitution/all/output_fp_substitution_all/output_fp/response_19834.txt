Creating more inclusive social policies for average earner genderqueer individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and discrimination faced by this community. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge and recognize genderqueer identity: Recognize and respect the genderqueer identity, which is a valid and legitimate identity that falls outside of the traditional binary gender categories of male and female. Ensure that policies and laws are inclusive of all genders, including those who identify as non-binary, genderfluid, or agender.
2. Address intersectionality: Genderqueer individuals may face intersecting forms of discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, and other aspects of their identity. Policies should take into account these intersections and address the specific challenges faced by each individual.
3. Implement inclusive language and terminology: Use language and terminology that is inclusive and respectful of all genders. Avoid using binary gender terms or language that assumes a fixed gender identity.
4. Provide access to healthcare: Ensure that healthcare policies and services are inclusive of genderqueer individuals. This includes providing access to gender-affirming care, such as hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries, for those who need it.
5. Advocate for equal pay: Implement policies that promote equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender identity or expression. Address the gender pay gap by conducting regular pay audits and implementing policies to address disparities.
6. Address discrimination in education: Ensure that educational policies and practices are inclusive of genderqueer students. This includes providing access to gender-affirming facilities, such as bathrooms and locker rooms, and addressing bullying and harassment based on gender identity.
7. Promote representation and visibility: Increase the representation and visibility of genderqueer individuals in media, politics, and other areas of society. This can help to challenge stereotypes and promote understanding and acceptance of genderqueer identities.
8. Support community building and social connections: Create opportunities for genderqueer individuals to connect with one another and build a sense of community and support. This can help to address feelings of isolation and marginalization.
