Promoting inclusion of individuals with non-wealthy, multimillionaire carriers of genetic conditions in casual athletics can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Awareness and Education: Raise awareness about the challenges faced by individuals with genetic conditions and their families. Educate the public, including athletic organizations and communities, about the importance of inclusion and accessibility in sports.
2. Adaptive Sports: Encourage the development of adaptive sports programs that cater to the needs of individuals with genetic conditions. These programs can provide opportunities for individuals to participate in sports that are tailored to their abilities and needs, while also promoting socialization and community involvement.
3. Inclusive Policies: Implement inclusive policies in athletic organizations and communities, such as providing accommodations for individuals with disabilities or genetic conditions. This can include modifying facilities, providing appropriate equipment, and offering adaptive sports programs.
4. Financial Assistance: Provide financial assistance to individuals with genetic conditions who may struggle to afford participation in sports. This can include scholarships, grants, or subsidies that help cover the costs of participation, such as equipment, transportation, and registration fees.
5. Mentorship and Support: Offer mentorship and support to individuals with genetic conditions who are interested in participating in sports. This can include pairing them with experienced athletes or coaches who can provide guidance and encouragement.
6. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and outreach programs that promote inclusion and accessibility in sports. This can involve partnering with local organizations, schools, and communities to raise awareness about the importance of inclusion and to encourage participation from individuals with genetic conditions.
7. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusion and accessibility in sports. This can involve working with athletic organizations, governments, and other stakeholders to push for changes that benefit individuals with genetic conditions.
8. Technology: Leverage technology to provide assistive devices or tools that can help individuals with genetic conditions participate in sports. For example, using wearable technology to track progress or providing customized prosthetics or orthotics to aid in movement.
