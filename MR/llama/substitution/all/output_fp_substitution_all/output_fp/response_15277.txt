1. Understand the diverse experiences of nominal Christians: Nominal Christians come from various backgrounds, cultures, and socio-economic statuses. It's essential to recognize and appreciate these differences when designing policies that cater to their needs.
2. Foster a sense of belonging: Nominal Christians may feel disconnected or marginalized within the Church or society. Creating inclusive policies can help them feel valued and included, which is critical for their well-being and sense of purpose.
