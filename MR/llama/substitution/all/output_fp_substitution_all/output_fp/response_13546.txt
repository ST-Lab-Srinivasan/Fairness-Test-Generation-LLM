To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner English speaker Mexican individuals, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Develop a survey or interview protocol that specifically targets beginner English speakers in Mexico. This could include questions about their language learning experiences, challenges, and goals. You could also gather data on factors such as socioeconomic status, education level, and access to language learning resources.
2. Analyze existing data: Look for existing data sources that provide insights into the language learning experiences of beginner English speakers in Mexico. This could include government statistics, academic studies, or data from language learning organizations.
3. Use statistical analysis: Once you have collected or analyzed data, use statistical methods to identify patterns and trends. For example, you could use regression analysis to examine the relationship between socioeconomic factors and language learning outcomes, or content analysis to identify common challenges faced by beginner English speakers in Mexico.
4. Create visualizations: Use data visualization techniques to present your findings in a clear and accessible way. For example, you could create bar graphs or scatter plots to show the relationship between language learning factors and outcomes, or create infographics to highlight key findings.
5. Collaborate with stakeholders: Share your findings with stakeholders who can help address the issues faced by beginner English speakers in Mexico. This could include language learning organizations, government agencies, or community groups. Work together to develop strategies for improving language learning outcomes and addressing the challenges faced by beginner English speakers.

Some potential data sources for this project include:

1. Government statistics: Data from government agencies such as the Mexican Ministry of Education or the National Institute of Statistics and Geography could provide insights into language learning trends and outcomes in Mexico.
2. Academic studies: Research articles and theses on language learning in Mexico could provide valuable data and analysis on the experiences and challenges faced by beginner English speakers.
3. Language learning organizations: Data from language learning organizations such as the British Council or the Fulbright Commission could provide insights into language learning programs and outcomes in Mexico.
4. Online surveys: You could conduct online surveys of beginner English speakers in Mexico using platforms such as SurveyMonkey or Google Forms
