Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner English speakers, especially those who identify as gender-fluid. Gender identity is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person's identity that can affect various aspects of their life, including their social relationships, mental health, and overall well-being. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner English speakers who identify as gender-fluid and are actively partially identifying as such.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that gender identity can have a profound impact on an individual's mental health, social relationships, and overall well-being (Bailey et al., 2017). Gender-fluid individuals often face discrimination and stigma in their daily lives, which can lead to higher rates of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues (Moskowitz & Grossman, 2014). Marital status can also play a significant role in an individual's life, particularly when it comes to social support and access to resources (Waheed et al., 2017). However, there is limited research on the specific impacts of marital status on gender-fluid individuals.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, employing semi-structured interviews with beginner English speakers who identify as gender-fluid and are actively partially identifying as such. Participants will be recruited through online gender-affirming communities and support groups, and will be selected based on their self-identification as gender-fluid and their active partial identification of this aspect of their identity. A total of 20 participants will be interviewed, with each participant being guaranteed anonymity and confidentiality.

Results:
The results of the interviews will be analyzed thematically, with a focus on identifying patterns and trends in the impacts of marital status on the lives of gender-fluid individuals. The following themes are anticipated to emerge from the data:

1. Social isolation: Many participants reported feeling isolated and alone in their gender identity, particularly in regards to their marital status. This isolation can lead to feelings of loneliness,
