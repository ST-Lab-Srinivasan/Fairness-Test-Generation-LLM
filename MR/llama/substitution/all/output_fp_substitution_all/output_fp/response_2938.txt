Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Refugee Temporary Visa Holders to the US Non-Liberal Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of refugees who have recently arrived in the United States on temporary visas. As individuals from non-liberal countries, these refugees often face unique challenges in adapting to a new cultural context.

Another participant expressed frustration with American cultural norms, stating, "I just don't understand why people are so focused on individualism here. In my culture, we value
