Creating more inclusive community events for native English speaker employed people can be achieved by considering the following strategies:

1. Representation Matters: Ensure that the event's planning committee and speakers reflect the diversity of the community. This includes inviting representatives from different cultures, ethnicities, ages, and abilities to participate in the planning process and to share their perspectives.
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event is accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Language Support: Offer language support for non-native English speakers by providing translation services, interpreters, or bilingual staff at the event. This will help ensure that everyone can fully participate and understand the content being shared.
4. Inclusive Promotion: Use inclusive language in promoting the event to avoid perpetuating stereotypes or excluding certain groups. Avoid using language that assumes a specific cultural background or identity, such as "native English speakers." Instead, use language that is welcoming and inclusive of all members of the community.
5. Flexible Scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate different work schedules and caregiving responsibilities. This can include holding the event during non-traditional hours or providing childcare services for attendees who may need them.
6. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that cater to diverse interests and abilities. This can include cultural performances, art exhibits, or hands-on workshops that allow attendees to engage with the content in a meaningful way.
7. Community Outreach: Engage with local community organizations that serve diverse populations to promote the event. Partner with groups that specialize in outreach and engagement with underrepresented communities, such as immigrant groups or LGBTQ+ organizations.
8. Accessibility Features: Ensure that the event space is physically accessible to all attendees. Provide features such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms to ensure that everyone can fully participate.
