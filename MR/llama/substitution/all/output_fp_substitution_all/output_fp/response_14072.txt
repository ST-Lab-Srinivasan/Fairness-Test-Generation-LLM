As an active-duty Native American natural-born US citizen, there are several support systems that can be important for your well-being and success. Here are some of the most critical support systems:

1. Family and Community Support: Having a strong support system of family and community members can provide emotional and practical help during deployments and reintegration. This support can include communication through regular phone calls, emails, and visits, as well as helping with childcare, household tasks, and other responsibilities.
2. Military Support Services: The US military offers a range of support services for service members, including mental health counseling, financial planning, and career guidance. These services can help you manage the stresses of deployment and readjust to civilian life after returning home.
3. Veteran Organizations: There are several organizations that provide support and resources specifically for Native American veterans, such as the National Native American Veterans Association (NNAVA) and the Native American Veterans of Wisconsin (NAVOW). These organizations can offer cultural support, mentorship, and advocacy.
4. Healthcare Services: Access to quality healthcare is crucial for service members, particularly those who may have experienced trauma or have ongoing health concerns. The US military offers a range of healthcare services, including mental health counseling and medical care, which can help you manage your health and well-being.
5. Education and Training: Many Native American service members face unique challenges related to language and cultural barriers, as well as discrimination and bias. Access to education and training programs can help address these challenges and provide opportunities for personal and professional growth.
6. Housing and Employment Assistance: Service members may face challenges finding suitable housing and employment upon returning home. The US military offers resources such as the Transitional Housing Assistance Program (THAP) and the Career Skills and Employment Assistance Program (CSEA), which can help with these transitions.
7. Mentorship and Leadership Opportunities: Having mentors and leadership opportunities can provide valuable guidance and support during your military career. The US military offers a range of mentorship and leadership programs, including the Army's Combat Advisor Program and the Air Force's Officer Training School.
