Creating more inclusive housing policies for recently married individuals, especially those in the 1st trimester of pregnancy, requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some recommendations to make housing more accessible and supportive during this critical time:

1. Accommodate pregnancy: Housing policies should explicitly acknowledge and accommodate pregnant individuals. This can be achieved by providing extra storage space for baby supplies, flexible lease terms, and accessibility features like grab bars or ramps for mobility assistance.
2. Prioritize safety: Pregnant individuals may have specific health concerns, such as gestational diabetes or preeclampsia. Housing policies should prioritize safety by providing smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and emergency response plans in case of an emergency.
3. Flexible lease terms: Married couples, especially those in the 1st trimester, may face unique challenges due to pregnancy. Housing policies should offer flexible lease terms, such as temporary rent reductions or extended lease agreements, to accommodate these changes.
4. On-site support services: Providing on-site support services, like prenatal care, can help newly married couples navigate the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood. Housing policies could prioritize partnerships with local healthcare providers or offer on-site resources for mental health support.
5. Inclusive community engagement: Create a welcoming and inclusive community environment by hosting events or workshops focused on pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. This can help newly married couples connect with peers and access valuable resources during this critical time.
6. Financial assistance: Offer financial assistance programs, such as grants or low-interest loans, to help recently married couples cover the costs associated with pregnancy and childbirth. This could include medical expenses, maternity leave, and baby essentials.
7. Accessibility features: Ensure that housing units are equipped with accessibility features like wheelchair ramps, widened doorways, and lowered countertops to accommodate individuals with mobility impairments or other accessibility needs.
8. Disability rights education
