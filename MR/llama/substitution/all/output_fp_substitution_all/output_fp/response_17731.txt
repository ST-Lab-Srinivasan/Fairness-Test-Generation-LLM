The term "non-liberal" can be somewhat problematic, as it can be perceived as marginalizing or stigmatizing individuals who do not identify with liberal values. It is important to recognize that people hold a wide range of political beliefs and values, and that inclusivity should be extended to all individuals regardless of their political affiliation.

Instead of focusing on inclusivity for "non-liberal" people, it may be more productive to prioritize inclusivity for individuals who face marginalization or exclusion based on their socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, religion, or other factors. This can involve addressing systemic inequalities and working to create a more equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources.

Here are some ways to support social inclusion of individuals from diverse backgrounds:

1. Advocate for policies that promote economic equality, such as progressive taxation, affordable housing, and access to education and healthcare.
2. Support community-based initiatives that foster inclusivity and address social isolation, such as volunteering at local non-profits or organizing community events.
3. Engage in respectful dialogue with individuals from different backgrounds to better understand their experiences and perspectives, and to find common ground.
4. Challenge discriminatory language and behaviors, and promote cultural sensitivity and understanding.
5. Advocate for the rights of marginalized groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals.
6. Support organizations that provide resources and services to marginalized communities, such as community centers, food banks, and mental health clinics.
7. Engage in advocacy and activism efforts to address systemic inequalities and promote social justice.
8. Educate oneself about the experiences and challenges faced by marginalized groups, and actively work to dismantle oppressive systems and structures.
9. Support policies that promote inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of society, including education, employment, and politics.
10. Engage in ongoing self-reflection and evaluation of one's own biases and privileges, and work to dismantle them.
