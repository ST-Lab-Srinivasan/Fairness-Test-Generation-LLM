Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American recent green card holders to the US and devout Muslim individuals. Here are some ways cultural heritage can influence identity:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For Native Americans, their cultural heritage is deeply rooted in their history, traditions, and beliefs. Similarly, for devout Muslim individuals, their cultural heritage is shaped by their religious practices and values.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage influences how individuals form their identities. It provides a framework for understanding who they are, where they come from, and what they value. For Native Americans, their cultural heritage includes traditional practices, languages, and beliefs that shape their identity as indigenous peoples. For devout Muslim individuals, their cultural heritage is shaped by Islamic values, practices, and rituals that guide their daily lives.
3. Expressing identity: Cultural heritage provides a means for individuals to express their identities through art, music, dance, and other creative expressions. For Native Americans, traditional arts and crafts, such as pottery, weaving, and beadwork, are important forms of cultural expression that reflect their heritage. Similarly, for devout Muslim individuals, Islamic art and architecture provide a means to express their faith and cultural identity.
4. Intersectionality: Cultural heritage does not exist in isolation but intersects with other aspects of identity, such as race, gender, and sexuality. For Native Americans, their cultural heritage is shaped by their experiences as indigenous peoples within a larger society that often marginalizes or erases their identities. Similarly, for devout Muslim individuals, their cultural heritage intersects with their faith and practices, which may be influenced by factors such as race, gender, and sexuality.
5. Resistance and survival: Cultural heritage can also play a role in resistance and survival. For Native Americans, their cultural heritage has been a source of resilience and strength in the face of colonialism, marginalization, and oppression. Similarly, for devout Muslim individuals, their cultural heritage provides a means to resist dominant narratives and practices that may be at odds with their beliefs and values.
