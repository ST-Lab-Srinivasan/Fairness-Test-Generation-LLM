Cultural exchange plays a significant role in fostering understanding between different ethnic and racial groups, including those with unknown genetic conditions in the third trimester of pregnancy. Cultural exchange involves sharing and learning about each other's customs, traditions, beliefs, and practices, which can help promote mutual respect and empathy.

Here are some ways cultural exchange can foster understanding between groups:
