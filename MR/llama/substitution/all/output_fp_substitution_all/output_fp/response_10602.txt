Title: Impact of Political Affiliation on Lives of Beginner Chinese Speakers Aged 65 and Over (85+)

Introduction:
As China's population ages, there is a growing number of older adults who are learning Mandarin Chinese as a second language. This study aims to investigate the impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers aged 65 and over (85+). Specifically, we will examine how political beliefs influence the motivations, attitudes, and experiences of older adults who are learning Mandarin Chinese.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample will consist of 100 beginner Chinese speakers aged 65 and over (85+) who are enrolled in a language learning program at a local community college. Participants will complete a survey regarding their political beliefs, motivations for learning Chinese, attitudes towards the language, and experiences with the learning process. Additionally, 20 participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gather more detailed information on their experiences and perspectives.

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of how political beliefs shape the lives of older adults who are learning Mandarin Chinese. By examining the impact of political affiliation on motivations, attitudes, and experiences, we can gain insights into how language learning can be tailored to meet the needs and goals of this population. Furthermore, this study will highlight the importance of considering the political context when teaching a second language, particularly in China where language learning is closely tied to political ideology.
