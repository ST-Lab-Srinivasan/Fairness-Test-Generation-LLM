Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent undocumented immigrants in education requires a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some strategies that educators, administrators, and policymakers can consider:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers to understand the cultural backgrounds and experiences of Native American students, including their history of trauma and resilience. Encourage teachers to incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and practices into the curriculum.
2. Language preservation: Support the revitalization of Native American languages by providing language classes or hiring linguists to work with Native American students. This can help preserve cultural identity and ensure that students can communicate effectively in school.
3. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and practices into science, math, and other subjects. This can help students see the relevance of their culture to their education and promote a sense of belonging.
4. Trauma-informed teaching: Recognize that many Native American students have experienced trauma related to colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression. Provide training on trauma-informed teaching strategies and create safe spaces for students to process their experiences.
5. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Native American communities to provide cultural resources, mentorship, and opportunities for student engagement. This can help build trust and create a sense of belonging among students.
6. Indigenous curriculum design: Co-create curriculum with Native American communities to ensure that it reflects their cultural values, beliefs, and practices. This can help students see themselves reflected in the curriculum and promote a sense of ownership over their education.
7. Capacity building: Provide professional development opportunities for educators to learn about Native American cultures, histories, and experiences. This can help build capacity among teachers to provide culturally responsive instruction.
8. Policy advocacy: Advocate for policies that support the educational needs of Native American students, such as language revitalization programs, cultural competency training for educators, and increased funding for Native American education initiatives.
9. Student voice and agency: Empower Native American students to take an active role in their education by providing opportunities for leadership, decision-making, and cultural expression
