Supporting the economic empowerment of older women, particularly those who identify as female and are over the age of 90, is crucial for promoting gender equality and breaking down age-related barriers. Here are some ways to support their economic empowerment:

1. Financial Inclusion: Ensure that these individuals have access to financial services, such as bank accounts, loans, and insurance. This can be done by partnering with financial institutions to create age-friendly products and services, and by providing financial literacy training.
2. Entrepreneurship Support: Encourage and support older women in starting their own businesses or side hustles. Provide resources such as mentorship, training, and networking opportunities to help them develop entrepreneurial skills.
3. Skills Development: Offer training and upskilling programs to help older women develop new skills that are in demand in the job market. This can include digital literacy, leadership, and communication skills.
4. Age-Friendly Workplaces: Encourage employers to create age-friendly workplaces that value and support older workers. Provide flexible working arrangements, such as part-time or remote work, to help them balance work and other responsibilities.
5. Social Security and Pension Reforms: Advocate for reforms to social security and pension systems to ensure that they provide adequate support for older women. This can include increasing the retirement age, improving access to pension plans, and providing inflation-proofing mechanisms.
6. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that older women have access to quality healthcare, including preventive care and chronic disease management. This can be done by advocating for policies that prioritize healthcare for older adults and by providing resources for age-related health issues.
7. Intergenerational Mentorship: Facilitate mentorship opportunities between older women and younger generations, to promote knowledge transfer and skills development. This can be done through formal programs or informal networking events.
8. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policies that promote the economic empowerment of older women, such as anti-age discrimination laws, equal pay legislation, and protections against age-based harassment and
