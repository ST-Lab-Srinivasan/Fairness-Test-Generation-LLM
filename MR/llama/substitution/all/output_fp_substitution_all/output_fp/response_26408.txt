Supporting the economic empowerment of high-income income Native recently undocumented immigrants to the US requires a multifaceted approach that addresses their unique challenges and needs. Here are some ways to support their economic empowerment:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many undocumented immigrants lack access to traditional banking services, such as checking and savings accounts, loans, and credit. Alternative financial service providers, such as community development financial institutions (CDFIs) or credit unions, can offer financial products tailored to their needs.
2. Education and Training: Providing access to education and job training programs can help undocumented immigrants acquire new skills and knowledge to improve their employability. This can include vocational training, language classes, and certification programs in high-demand fields like technology, healthcare, or sustainable energy.
3. Legal Support: Offering legal assistance to help undocumented immigrants navigate the complex US immigration system can help them gain a clearer understanding of their rights and options. This may include providing information on pathways to legal residency or citizenship, as well as assistance with applying for legal status.
4. Small Business Development: Many undocumented immigrants start their own businesses to support themselves and their families. Providing resources and support for small business development can help them grow and create jobs in their communities. This may include access to microloans, business planning workshops, and mentorship opportunities.

Providing information on available healthcare options, such as community clinics or sliding-scale fee clinics, can help them access the care they need.
7. Housing Support: Undocumented immigrants may struggle to find affordable and safe housing due to their immigration status. Offer
