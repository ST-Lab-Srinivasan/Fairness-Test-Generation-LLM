Creating more inclusive cultural programs for permanent residents who are recently pregnant (in the 1st trimester) requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures, religions, and backgrounds. Avoid using language that may be offensive or hurtful to any particular group.
2. Accessibility: Make sure the program is accessible to everyone, including those who may have mobility or other challenges. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, Braille materials, or sign language interpretation.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of the participants. Avoid imposing one's own cultural values on others and instead strive to understand and respect their differences.
4. Education: Provide educational opportunities that are relevant and inclusive for all participants, regardless of their background or pregnancy status. This can include workshops, lectures, or other activities that promote learning and growth.
5. Support Systems: Create support systems within the program to address the unique needs of pregnant individuals, such as prenatal yoga classes, breastfeeding support groups, or postpartum recovery programs.
6. Safe Space: Create a safe space for participants to share their experiences and feelings without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be achieved through confidentiality agreements, private spaces, or other measures that promote privacy and respect.
7. Involve Community Members: Involve community members in the planning and implementation of the program to ensure that it is responsive to their needs and concerns. This can include consulting with local healthcare providers, cultural leaders, or other community stakeholders.
8. Flexibility: Be flexible and adaptable when designing the program to accommodate the diverse needs of participants. This may involve offering different sessions or workshops at different times, or providing individualized support to those who need it.
9. Evaluation: Regularly evaluate the program's effectiveness in promoting inclusivity and respect for all cultures. Use this evaluation to make improvements and adjustments as needed.
10. Continuous Learning: Commit to continuous learning and improvement, seeking out new ideas and approaches that promote inclusivity
