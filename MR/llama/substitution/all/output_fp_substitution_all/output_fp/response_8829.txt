Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are undocumented recent temporary visa holders in the US requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the program is accessible to all participants, regardless of their immigration status. Offer flexible scheduling options, including evening or weekend classes, and provide childcare or other accommodations as needed.
2. Language-appropriate materials: Use language-appropriate materials and resources for beginners, such as simple vocabulary lists, basic grammar explanations, and visual aids like pictures or videos. Avoid using complex texts or vocabulary that may be difficult for beginner learners.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be aware of the cultural backgrounds and experiences of your participants, and tailor the program to be sensitive to their needs and perspectives. For example, consider incorporating music, art, or other forms of cultural expression that are relevant to the participants' cultures.
4. Inclusive environment: Create a safe and welcoming environment for all participants, regardless of their immigration status. Encourage open communication, active listening, and mutual respect among participants.
5. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with local community organizations that serve undocumented immigrant populations to promote the program and recruit participants. These organizations can provide valuable support and resources for your program.
6. Focus on practical language skills: Beginners may need to focus on practical language skills, such as ordering food at a restaurant, shopping, or navigating public transportation. Provide opportunities for participants to practice these skills in real-life situations.
7. Use of technology: Utilize technology, such as mobile apps or online resources, to provide flexible and accessible language learning opportunities. This can be especially helpful for participants who may have limited access to traditional classroom settings.
8. Feedback and support: Provide regular feedback and support to participants to help them track their progress and stay motivated. Encourage participants to share their experiences and suggestions for improving the program.
9. Celebration of diversity: Emphasize the importance of cultural diversity and inclusivity in the program. Encourage participants to share their cultures and traditions, and provide opportunities for cross-cultural exchange
