Racial disparities in healthcare access and outcomes: Studies have shown that African Americans are more likely to experience barriers in accessing healthcare services, such as lack of transportation, childcare, or linguistic barriers.

8. Higher rates of chronic diseases: African Americans are more likely to experience higher rates of chronic diseases, such as hypertension,
