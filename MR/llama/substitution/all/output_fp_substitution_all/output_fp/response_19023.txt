Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly as they age and enter their golden years. This is especially true for native French speakers who are over 90 years old and middle-aged (over 85). In this study, we aim to investigate the impact of political affiliation on the lives of these individuals over a period of 90 years.

Methodology:
We conducted a survey of 100 native French speakers who are over 85 years old and living in France. The survey consisted of questions that inquired about their political beliefs, socioeconomic status, health conditions, and overall quality of life. We also collected demographic information such as gender, education level, and marital status.

Results:
Our findings indicate that political affiliation has a significant impact on the lives of middle-aged native French speakers over 90 years old. Those who identified as belonging to the left or center-left political ideology reported better health conditions and higher overall quality of life compared to those who identified as right-wing or extremist.

Conversely, individuals who identified as right-wing or extremist reported lower levels of social security and economic stability compared to their left-leaning counterparts. This was particularly true for those who lived through the Great Depression and World War II, as they experienced firsthand the impact of political ideologies on their daily lives.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the significant impact that political affiliation can have on the lives of middle-aged native French speakers over 90 years old. While both left-leaning and right-wing individuals reported similar levels of social isolation, those who identified as left-leaning reported better health conditions and higher overall quality of life.

Our findings suggest that political beliefs can have a profound impact on an individual's sense of security and well-being, particularly during times of economic instability or conflict. As the global population ages, it is essential to understand how political affiliation shapes the experiences and perceptions of older adults.

Future research should continue to explore the complex relationships between political beliefs, socioeconomic factors, and health outcomes among aging populations. By examining these relationships, we can better support and empower older
