Lower middle-income ethnic African Americans face several challenges in the US healthcare system, including:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Lower middle-income individuals may struggle to afford health insurance or access healthcare services due to financial constraints. This can result in delayed or foregone care, exacerbating health disparities.
2. Discrimination and bias: Ethnic African Americans may experience discrimination or bias in the healthcare system, leading to a lack of trust or feeling uncomfortable seeking care. This can result in lower adherence to treatment plans or avoidance of necessary care.
3. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the unique cultural practices and beliefs of ethnic African Americans, leading to miscommunication or misunderstandings that can affect health outcomes.
4. Limited availability of culturally competent providers: The healthcare workforce may lack representation of ethnic African Americans, resulting in a lack of culturally sensitive care.
5. Health disparities: Ethnic African Americans may experience higher rates of chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. They may also face barriers to accessing quality care for these conditions.
6. Limited availability of community resources: Lower middle-income ethnic African Americans may have limited access to community resources, such as healthy food options, safe spaces for exercise, or mental health support services.
7. Lack of representation in medical research: The healthcare system may not adequately address the unique needs and experiences of ethnic African Americans due to a lack of representation in medical research and development.
8. Stigma associated with seeking care: Lower middle-income ethnic African Americans may experience stigma or shame when seeking medical care, particularly for non-acute conditions.
9. Limited English proficiency: Individuals who are limited English proficient may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to a lack of interpreter services or cultural competency among healthcare providers.
10. Lack of continuity of care: Lower middle-income ethnic African Americans may experience gaps in care due to limited access to primary care providers or specialists, leading to poor health outcomes.
