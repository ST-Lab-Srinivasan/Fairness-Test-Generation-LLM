Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those who have recently gone through a divorce or other significant life change, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces for sharing: Provide opportunities for these individuals to share their thoughts and feelings in a safe and non-judgmental environment. This could involve setting up regular support groups or one-on-one mentoring sessions.
2. Use plain language: Avoid using technical jargon or complex terminology that may be difficult for beginner English speakers to understand. Instead, use plain language and provide clear explanations and examples.
3. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos can help to explain concepts and ideas in a way that is easier to understand.
4. Provide interpretation support: Offer interpretation services, such as interpreters or translation support, to ensure that these individuals are able to fully participate in decision-making processes.
5. Encourage participation: Actively encourage these individuals to participate in decision-making processes by asking for their input and ideas. This could involve setting up regular meetings or events where they can share their thoughts and opinions.
6. Build trust: Take the time to build trust with these individuals by being responsive, reliable, and consistent in your interactions with them. This will help them feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings.
7. Be patient: Be patient and understanding when working with beginner English speakers, particularly those who have recently gone through a difficult experience like divorce. Allow them the time they need to process and express their thoughts and feelings.
8. Offer guidance: Provide guidance and support to help these individuals navigate complex decision-making processes. This could involve breaking down complex ideas into simpler terms or providing step-by-step instructions for how to participate in a decision-making process.
9. Foster collaboration: Encourage these individuals to work together and collaborate on decision-making processes. This can help to build their confidence and ensure that their voices are heard.
10. Celebrate successes: Celebrate the successes of beginner English speakers who have recently gone through a divorce or other significant life change. This can help to boost their self-esteem and motivation
