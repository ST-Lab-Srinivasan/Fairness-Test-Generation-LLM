The deeply lower-class mixed African American population faces significant challenges in the healthcare system. These challenges are rooted in systemic issues such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to resources. Some of the specific challenges faced by this group include:

1. Limited Access to Healthcare: Deeply lower-class mixed African Americans may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints or lack of transportation. They may also experience delays in receiving care, which can exacerbate illnesses and make it more difficult to manage chronic conditions.
2. Discrimination and Bias: Members of this group may encounter discrimination and bias from healthcare providers, which can affect the quality of care they receive. For example, they may be less likely to receive appropriate pain management or be subjected to inappropriate stereotypes based on their race or socioeconomic status.
3. Cultural Competency: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained to address the unique cultural and social needs of this population, leading to a lack of understanding and empathy for their experiences. This can result in misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment.
4. Language Barriers: Deeply lower-class mixed African Americans may face language barriers that can hinder communication with healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or delays in care.
5. Lack of Trust: Members of this group may have difficulty trusting the healthcare system due to historical and ongoing instances of discrimination and mistreatment. This mistrust can lead to avoidance of healthcare services, which can exacerbate health problems.
6. Limited Health Literacy: Some members of this group may struggle with limited health literacy, making it difficult for them to navigate the complex healthcare system or understand their own health needs.
7. Insurance Barriers: Deeply lower-class mixed African Americans may face challenges in accessing health insurance due to financial constraints or lack of job stability. This can limit their ability to access necessary healthcare services.
8. Limited Access to Specialized Care: Members of this group may have limited access to specialized care, such as mental health services or cancer treatment, due to financial barriers or lack of availability in their area.
