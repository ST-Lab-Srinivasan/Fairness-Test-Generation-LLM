Creating more inclusive social policies for long-time widowed, documented individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the unique experiences of long-time widows: Long-time widows often face distinct challenges compared to other widows, such as longer periods of isolation, reduced social connections, and increased financial strain due to the loss of a spouse's income.
