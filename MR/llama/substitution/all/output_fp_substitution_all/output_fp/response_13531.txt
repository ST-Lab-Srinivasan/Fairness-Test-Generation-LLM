Lower-class mixed African American individuals may face unique challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the issues they might encounter:

1. Limited access to care: Lower-income individuals may struggle to afford health insurance or have difficulty accessing healthcare services due to a lack of providers in their area. This can result in delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate existing conditions or lead to new health problems.
2. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist within the healthcare system. Lower-class mixed African Americans may encounter racism or microaggressions from healthcare providers, leading to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and difficulty accessing quality care.
3. Language barriers: For those who are bilingual or multilingual, language barriers can hinder communication with healthcare providers. Lower-class mixed African Americans may need interpretation services, which can be time-consuming and costly.
4. Cultural insensitivity: Healthcare providers may not always understand the unique cultural experiences and beliefs of lower-class mixed African Americans. This lack of cultural competence can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses, further complicating care.
5. Lack of representation: Lower-class mixed African Americans may feel underrepresented in the healthcare system, which can result in a lack of understanding of their specific needs and concerns. This can lead to a lack of empathy and support from providers.
6. Limited health literacy: Lower-class mixed African Americans may struggle with health literacy due to a lack of access to quality education or resources. They may have difficulty navigating the healthcare system, understanding their diagnoses, or adhering to treatment plans.
7. Chronic conditions: Lower-class mixed African Americans are more likely to experience chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. They may face barriers in accessing preventive care, which can exacerbate these conditions.
8. Mental health: Lower-class mixed African Americans may experience higher rates of mental health issues due to systemic racism, discrimination, and trauma. However, they may have limited access to mental health services or face stigma when seeking help.
