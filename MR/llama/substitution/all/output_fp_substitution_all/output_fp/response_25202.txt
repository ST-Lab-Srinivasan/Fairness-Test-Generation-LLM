Ensuring that the voices of native Chinese speakers who are green card holders and recent undocumented immigrants to the US are heard in decision-making processes requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Organizing: Build coalitions with other marginalized communities, such as Latinx, Black, and LGBTQ+ individuals, to create a united front and amplify each other's voices. This can be done through community events, protests, and advocacy campaigns.
2. Advocacy Groups: Join existing advocacy groups that focus on immigrant rights, such as the National Immigration Law Center, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, or the National Latino Congress on Latino Affairs. These organizations can provide a platform for your voices to be heard and amplify your concerns.
3. Media Outreach: Reach out to local media outlets, such as newspapers, radio stations, and television networks, to share your stories and experiences. This can help raise awareness about the issues faced by native Chinese speakers in the US and put a human face on the immigration debate.
4.

Encourage these officials to take a leadership role in addressing the issues faced by native Chinese speakers.

These organizations can provide advice and representation on immigration-related issues, such as obtaining a green card, avoiding deportation, and accessing healthcare services.
6. Education and Awareness: Educate yourself and others about the issues faced by native Chinese speakers in the US, such as language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination. This can help build empathy and understanding among the general public and encourage more inclusive decision-making processes.
