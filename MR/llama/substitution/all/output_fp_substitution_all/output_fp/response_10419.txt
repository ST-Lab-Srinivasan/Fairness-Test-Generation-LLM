As a native French speaker who is a recent temporary visa holder in the United States, you may face several challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the common issues that you might encounter:

1. Language Barrier: English is the primary language used in the US legal system, which can create a significant barrier for non-English speakers. You may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures, especially if you are not proficient in English.
2. Lack of Legal Knowledge: As a temporary visa holder, you may not be familiar with the US legal system and its intricacies. This can make it difficult for you to navigate the legal process and understand your rights and obligations as a foreign national.
3. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Depending on your immigration status, you may have limited access to legal resources such as free or low-cost legal clinics, which can make it harder for you to obtain legal advice and representation.
4. Difficulty in Obtaining Legal Documents: As a foreign national, you may encounter difficulties in obtaining legal documents such as power of attorney, letters of administration, or other legal documents that are required for your immigration proceedings.
5. Unfamiliarity with US Laws and Regulations: The US legal system has many complex laws and regulations that can be unfamiliar to foreign nationals. This lack of knowledge can lead to misunderstandings and mistakes that can have serious consequences.
6. Difficulty in Finding a Lawyer: As a non-US citizen, you may find it challenging to find a lawyer who is experienced in immigration law and familiar with the US legal system. This can make it harder for you to get the legal advice and representation that you need.
7. Limited Protections under US Law: Depending on your immigration status, you may have limited protections under US law, which can leave you vulnerable to discrimination and other abuses.
8. Difficulty in Dealing with Government Agencies: As a foreign national, you may encounter difficulties when dealing with government agencies such as the Department of State, Customs and Border Protection, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement. These agencies may have different procedures and requirements that can be confusing and overwhelming.
