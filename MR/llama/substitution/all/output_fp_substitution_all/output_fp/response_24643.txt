As a family law attorney, I can provide some insights on the challenges that recently divorced recently naturalized citizen individuals may face in the legal system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Lack of familiarity with the legal system: As a recent immigrant and divorcee, this individual may not be familiar with the legal system in their new country. They may struggle to navigate the complexities of family law, including issues related to child custody, support, and division of property.
2. Language barriers: Depending on the individual's native language and the language spoken in their new country, they may face challenges communicating with legal professionals and understanding legal documents. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can affect their legal rights and options.
3. Cultural differences: Different cultures have different values, beliefs, and practices when it comes to family law. The individual may encounter cultural differences in how the legal system approaches issues such as child custody, support, and property division. For example, some cultures place a greater emphasis on gender roles and responsibilities within the family, which can affect how the legal system approaches these issues.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against immigrants and non-traditional families is still prevalent in many parts of the world. The individual may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, or family structure. This can affect how the legal system treats them and their case.
5. Limited access to resources: As a recently naturalized citizen, this individual may not have access to the same resources as long-term residents of the country. For example, they may face barriers to accessing legal aid or other forms of support that are available to longer-term residents.
6. Difficulty building a network: Building a network of professionals and peers can be challenging for anyone, but especially so for recently divorced immigrants who may not have established connections in their new country yet. This can make it harder to find legal representation or advocacy support when needed.
7. Balancing competing priorities: As a recent immigrant and divorcee, this individual may face a range of competing priorities, such as building a new life in a foreign country, learning a new language and culture
