Creating more inclusive community events for former soldier high earners (HET) can be achieved by considering their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their interests: HETs have a diverse range of skills and experiences. Try to understand their interests and hobbies, such as sports, music, or volunteer work. This will help you tailor the event to their tastes and make them feel more comfortable.
2. Provide accessible locations: Ensure that the event location is accessible for HETs, including those with disabilities. Offer a variety of seating options and ensure that the venue is wheelchair-friendly.
3. Flexible timing: Many HETs have busy schedules or may have difficulty attending events during traditional working hours. Consider offering the event at non-traditional times, such as evenings or weekends, to make it more convenient for them.
4. Inclusive programming: Develop a program that caters to the diverse interests and needs of HETs. This could include workshops on financial planning, career development, or mental health support.
5. Accessible communication: Ensure that all communications related to the event are accessible and easy to understand for HETs. Use clear language and provide alternative formats, such as large print or braille, upon request.
6. Support for carers: Many HETs have family or caregiving responsibilities. Consider providing support for carers, such as childcare services or flexible seating arrangements, to make it easier for them to attend the event.
7. Professional attire: Some HETs may feel uncomfortable attending an event where they are the only ones in professional attire. Consider providing dress code guidelines or allowing attendees to dress in business casual attire to help them feel more at ease.
8. Transportation support: Offer transportation options, such as carpooling or shuttle services, to make it easier for HETs to attend the event without worrying about transportation.
9. Accommodations: For HETs who may need additional accommodations, such as ASL interpreters or audio describers, ensure that these are available and promoted in advance.
