* Improved decision-making: Diverse leaders can provide different perspectives on complex issues, leading to more informed and well-rounded decision-making.
* Enhanced representation: Leaders from underrepresented groups can help ensure that the needs and concerns of those groups are represented in leadership roles.
* Increased credibility: When organizations have diverse leaders, they may be seen as more inclusive and credible to a wider range of stakeholders.
