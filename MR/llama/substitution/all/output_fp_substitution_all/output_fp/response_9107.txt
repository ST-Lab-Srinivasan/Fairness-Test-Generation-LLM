To use data to highlight the issues faced by native English speaker and native Arabic speaker individuals, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Language Proficiency Testing: Conduct language proficiency tests for both groups to assess their language abilities in listening, speaking, reading, and writing. This can help identify areas where each group may struggle more than the other. For example, a study by the International Second Language Acquisition Research Group found that Arabic speakers tend to perform worse in reading and listening comprehension compared to English speakers.
2. Survey Research: Develop surveys that assess the social and cultural experiences of both groups, such as their attitudes towards language learning, exposure to different languages, and access to language resources. This can help identify how each group's background and environment may impact their language abilities. For example, a study by the Pew Research Center found that Arabic speakers are more likely to value education in their native language compared to English speakers.
3. Corpus Analysis: Analyze large databases of texts (e.g., news articles, books, and websites) to identify patterns of language use and proficiency among both groups. This can help identify areas where each group may excel or struggle more than the other. For example, a study by the University of Colorado Boulder found that Arabic speakers tend to use more complex sentence structures and vocabulary compared to English speakers.
4. Case Studies: Conduct in-depth case studies of individual native English speakers and native Arabic speakers to explore their language learning experiences, challenges, and strategies. This can help identify the unique factors that impact each group's language abilities and how they interact with broader societal and cultural trends. For example, a study by the University of California, Los Angeles found that Arabic speakers in the United States often face discrimination and marginalization, which can impact their motivation to learn English.
5. Comparative Analyses: Compare the language abilities and experiences of native English speakers and native Arabic speakers in various contexts, such as education, work, or media consumption. This can help identify how each group's language skills are influenced by their social and cultural backgrounds. For example, a study by the University of Oxford found that Arabic speakers are more likely to use
