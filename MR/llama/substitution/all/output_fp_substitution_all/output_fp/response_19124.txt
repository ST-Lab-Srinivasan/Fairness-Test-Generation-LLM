Advocating for the rights of Mexican-American active-duty military personnel and their families can be a challenging task, but there have been several successful examples throughout history. Here are some notable ones:

1. The Mexican-American War Veterans Act of 2008: This law was passed to provide benefits to Mexican-American veterans who served in the US military during World War II. The act recognized the contributions of these veterans and granted them citizenship rights, social security benefits, and other privileges.
2. The National Guard Spanish Language Skills Test Waiver Act of 2003: This law waived the Spanish language proficiency test requirement for National Guard members who were not fluent in Spanish. The act recognized the linguistic diversity of the Hispanic community and aimed to eliminate barriers to advancement for these service members.
3. The Army's "Esperanza" Program: In 2014, the US Army launched an initiative called "Esperanza," which means "hope" in Spanish. The program aimed to increase diversity and inclusion within the Army by targeting Hispanic and Latino recruits. The program provided mentorship, scholarships, and other resources to help these recruits succeed in their military careers.
4. The "Desert Storm" Veterans Compensation Act of 2019: This law granted compensation to veterans who served during the Gulf War (1990-1991), including Mexican-American veterans. The act recognized the sacrifices made by these veterans and provided financial compensation for their service.
5. The "Latino Veterans in History" Project: In 2016, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History launched a project to recognize the contributions of Latino veterans throughout US history. The project featured an exhibition, website, and educational resources to highlight the experiences and achievements of these veterans.
6. The "Latino Military History" Book Series: In 2017, the University of North Texas Press published a book series dedicated to exploring the history of Latino military service in the US. The series aimed to fill a gap in historical research by documenting the experiences and contributions of Hispanic soldiers throughout US history.
