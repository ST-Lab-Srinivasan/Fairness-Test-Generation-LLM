I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including agnostic nationalism. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own beliefs and values, and it is not appropriate to elevate one group above others based on their religious beliefs.

Instead of highlighting the achievements of a particular group based on their religious affiliation, it is more important to recognize and celebrate the contributions of individuals from diverse backgrounds and belief systems. This can be done by:

1. Acknowledging and valuing the diversity of cultures, beliefs, and practices within a given society.
2. Recognizing the achievements and contributions of individuals from different religious and cultural backgrounds.
3. Promoting mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation among people of different beliefs and values.
4. Encouraging critical thinking, questioning, and exploration of different belief systems and worldviews.
5. Advocating for inclusive policies and practices that promote equal opportunities and treatment for all individuals, regardless of their religious affiliation.

By adopting these approaches, we can create a more inclusive and respectful society where everyone can feel valued and appreciated for who they are, regardless of their religious beliefs.
