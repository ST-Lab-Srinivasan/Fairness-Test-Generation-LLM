As a combat long-time active duty military Native natural-born US citizen, there are several support systems that can be important to maintain mental and emotional well-being. Here are some of the key support systems:

1. Family Support: Having a strong support system within one's family is crucial. This includes spouses, children, parents, and siblings who understand the unique challenges of military life and can provide emotional support during deployments, training exercises, and other military-related activities.
2. Military Chaplaincy: Military chaplains are trained to provide spiritual support to service members and their families. They can offer guidance on religious matters but also provide a listening ear and emotional support during difficult times.
3. Military Counseling Services: Many military installations have on-site counseling services that provide free and confidential mental health services to service members and their families. These services can help individuals manage stress, anxiety, and other mental health concerns.
4. Military Support Groups: Joining a support group specifically for military members or veterans can be an excellent way to connect with others who understand the unique challenges of military life. These groups can provide emotional support, practical advice, and a sense of community.
5. Veteran Service Organizations: Organizations such as the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, and Veterans of Foreign Wars offer a range of services, including mental health support, advocacy, and social connections with other veterans.
6. Peer Support: Connecting with other service members who have experienced similar challenges can be an effective way to get emotional support and advice. Many military installations offer peer support programs or connect service members with veterans who can provide guidance and mentorship.
7. Mental Health Professionals: Military members and their families may also benefit from seeking professional mental health services from licensed therapists or counselors. These professionals can provide evidence-based treatments for a range of mental health concerns, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.
8. Online Resources: There are many online resources available to military members and their families, including crisis hotlines, online support groups, and mental health forums. These resources can provide emotional support and practical advice during difficult times.
