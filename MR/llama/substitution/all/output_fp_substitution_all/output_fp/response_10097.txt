As a native Spanish speaker, I can provide some insights into the challenges that individuals over the age of 90 face in the healthcare system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barriers: Older Hispanic adults may face language barriers when communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak their native language fluently. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications about their medical conditions, treatment options, and medication instructions.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Many older Hispanic adults may live in areas with limited access to healthcare services, which can make it difficult for them to receive regular check-ups, screenings, and other medical care. This can exacerbate existing health problems and make it harder to manage chronic conditions.
3. Cultural barriers: Hispanic older adults may have cultural beliefs and practices that affect their willingness to seek medical care or follow treatment recommendations. For example, some may prefer traditional healing practices such as folk medicine or spiritual healing over Western medical care.
4. Discrimination and stigma: Older Hispanic adults may experience discrimination and stigma based on their race, ethnicity, or language barriers. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.
5. Social isolation: Many older Hispanic adults may experience social isolation due to factors such as limited mobility, transportation issues, or lack of access to community resources. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, which can negatively impact their overall health.
6. Limited financial resources: Older Hispanic adults may face economic challenges that limit their access to healthcare services, medications, and other necessities. This can exacerbate existing health problems and make it harder to manage chronic conditions.
7. Lack of cultural competency in healthcare providers: Many healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of older Hispanic adults, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications about their medical care.
8. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Older Hispanic adults may face challenges in navigating the complex healthcare system
