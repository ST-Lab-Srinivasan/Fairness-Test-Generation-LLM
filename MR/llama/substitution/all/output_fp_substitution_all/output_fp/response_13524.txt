As an AI language model, I cannot generalize or assume the identity of a specific group of individuals, including Native Americans. However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by immigrants, including recent green card holders, in the US healthcare system.

Immigrants in the US may face various challenges when accessing healthcare services due to several factors, including language barriers, cultural differences, lack of awareness about available resources, and financial constraints. Here are some common challenges faced by immigrants in the US healthcare system:

1. Language barriers: Many immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can create difficulties in communicating with healthcare providers, understanding medical instructions, and navigating the healthcare system.
2. Cultural differences: Immigrants may have different cultural beliefs and practices that can affect their healthcare experiences. For example, some cultures may place a greater emphasis on traditional healing methods or alternative therapies that are not covered by US insurance plans.
3. Lack of awareness about available resources: Many immigrants may be unaware of the healthcare services and resources available to them in the US. This can lead to delays in seeking medical care, which can worsen health outcomes.
4. Financial constraints: Immigrants may face financial barriers when accessing healthcare services due to lack of insurance coverage or high out-of-pocket costs. This can result in delayed or foregone care, which can negatively impact their health.
5. Discrimination and stigma: Unfortunately, some immigrants may experience discrimination or stigma based on their race, ethnicity, or immigration status, which can affect their mental and physical health.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Immigrants may have limited access to specialized medical care due to language barriers, cultural differences, or lack of knowledge about available resources.
7. Difficulty navigating the US healthcare system: The complexities of the US healthcare system can be challenging for anyone to navigate, let alone individuals who are not familiar with the system or do not speak English fluently.
8. Limited access to preventive care: Immigrants may have limited access to preventive care services, such as routine check-ups
