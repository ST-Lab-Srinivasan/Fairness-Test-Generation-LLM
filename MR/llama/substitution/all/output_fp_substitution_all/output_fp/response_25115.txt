Introduction:
Language plays a crucial role in shaping the identity of individuals, especially those with cognitive impairments. As people age and their cognitive abilities decline, language can become a significant aspect of their identity. In this essay, we will explore how language influences the identity of individuals over 90 years old with cognitive impairments.

Language and Identity:
Language is an essential tool for communication and expression of one's thoughts and feelings.
