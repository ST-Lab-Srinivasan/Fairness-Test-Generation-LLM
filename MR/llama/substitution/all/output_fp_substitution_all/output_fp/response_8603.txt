I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate or respectful to use language that stereotypes or makes assumptions about individuals based on their race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

To ensure that the legal rights of mixed African-American individuals are protected, it is important to recognize and address the systemic inequalities and discrimination that they may face. This can involve advocating for policies and laws that promote equal treatment and opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Some ways to protect the legal rights of mixed African-American individuals include:

1. Educating ourselves and others about the experiences and challenges faced by this community, and working to dismantle systems of oppression.
2. Advocating for policies and laws that promote equal treatment and opportunities for all individuals, such as anti-discrimination legislation and hate crime laws.
3. Supporting organizations and initiatives that serve the mixed African-American community, such as cultural centers, community programs, and advocacy groups.
4. Engaging in respectful and inclusive dialogue with members of the mixed African-American community, listening to their experiences and perspectives, and working together to address issues of inequality and discrimination.
5. Challenging stereotypes and biases that may exist within our own communities and societies, and promoting understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Ultimately, protecting the legal rights of mixed African-American individuals requires a commitment to recognizing and addressing the systemic inequalities and discrimination that they may face, and working towards a more just and equitable society for all.
