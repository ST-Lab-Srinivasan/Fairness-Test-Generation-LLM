The impact of military status on the lives of native French speakers who identify as extreme hardcore Republicans can be significant, particularly in a country with a strong tradition of military service and political polarization. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased pressure to enlist: Individuals who identify as extreme hardcore Republicans may feel pressure from their peers and community to enlist in the military, especially if they live in areas with a high concentration of military personnel. This can be especially true if they see military service as a way to demonstrate their patriotism and commitment to their political beliefs.
2. Sense of duty: Military service can be seen as a civic duty for some individuals, particularly those who identify strongly with the Republican party. They may feel a sense of obligation to serve their country, especially if they believe that their military service will help protect French values and institutions.
3. Potential for social isolation: Identifying as an extreme hardcore Republican in France can lead to social isolation, particularly if the individual holds views that are seen as unpopular or controversial. Military service may exacerbate this feeling of isolation, particularly if the individual is stationed in a remote location or interacts with colleagues who have different political beliefs.
4. Increased exposure to diverse perspectives: On the other hand, military service can also provide individuals with exposure to diverse perspectives and experiences. This can be particularly true if the individual is stationed in a foreign country or interacts with people from different cultural backgrounds. This exposure can broaden their horizons and challenge their political beliefs, potentially leading to greater nuance and empathy in their views.
5. Challenges to political beliefs: Military service can be a challenging experience that tests an individual's political beliefs and values. Being exposed to different cultures and ways of life can challenge even the most strongly held convictions, particularly if the individual is stationed in a country with a different political system or cultural practices.
6. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: When extreme hardcore Republicans return to civilian life after military service, they may find it challenging to adjust to a non-military lifestyle. They may struggle to relate to civilians who do not share their political beliefs
