Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for beginner Chinese speakers who are partially heterosexual involves understanding and respecting the diversity of cultural practices and beliefs within the LGBTQ+ community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Consult with members of the LGBTQ+ community to understand their preferences and needs when it comes to cultural celebrations. This will help ensure that the celebrations are inclusive and respectful of their identities.
2. Use gender-neutral language: Avoid using gendered language or assumptions in your celebration materials, such as using "man" or "woman" instead of more inclusive terms like "person" or "individual."
3. Incorporate LGBTQ+ symbols and imagery: Include LGBTQ+ symbols and imagery in your celebration decorations, music, and other elements to show respect and support for the community.
4. Provide gender-neutral options: Offer gender-neutral options for celebrants, such as using "they/them" pronouns instead of "he/him" or "she/her." This can help create a more inclusive environment for individuals who identify outside of the gender binary.
5. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the LGBTQ+ community and their cultural practices. Share this knowledge with others to help create a more informed and respectful environment.
6. Be mindful of power dynamics: Recognize that cultural celebrations may have different meanings and connotations for different communities. Be mindful of power dynamics and avoid appropriating or exploiting LGBTQ+ cultural practices without proper understanding, permission, or credit.
7. Encourage participation: Make sure that all individuals feel welcome and included in the celebration. Encourage participation from those who may not identify with the dominant culture, and provide opportunities for them to share their perspectives and traditions.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of cultural practices and beliefs within the LGBTQ+ community. Avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes or assumptions about any particular identity or culture.
9. Be open to feedback: Be willing to listen to and incorporate feedback from the LGBTQ+ community
