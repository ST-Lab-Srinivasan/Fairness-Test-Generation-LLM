Title: The Impact of Genetic Conditions on the Lives of Strongly Asexual, Slightly Elderly Individuals (50s)

Introduction:
Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or age. In this report, we will focus on the experiences of strongly asexual, slightly elderly (50s) people living with genetic conditions. We conducted interviews with 15 participants to gain a deeper understanding of their challenges and how they cope with these conditions.

Methods:
We recruited participants through online communities and support groups for asexual individuals. Inclusion criteria were: (1) self-identification as strongly asexual, (2) aged 50 or older, and (3) living with a genetic condition. Participants completed an online survey and participated in a 60-minute interview via video conferencing.

2. Healthcare disparities: Participants faced challenges in accessing appropriate healthcare due to a lack of understanding about their condition among healthcare providers. They often had to advocate for themselves or rely on specialized care.

5. Social isolation: Many participants reported feeling isolated due to their sexual orientation and age. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
6. Lack of representation: Participants expressed a lack of representation in media, healthcare,
