Instead, I would recommend focusing on the specific challenges faced by unemployed individuals with diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds in the healthcare system. Some possible challenges that unemployed individuals with diverse backgrounds may face in the healthcare system include:

These disparities can result from systemic issues such as discrimination, unequal access to education and job opportunities, and a lack of investment in underserved communities.
