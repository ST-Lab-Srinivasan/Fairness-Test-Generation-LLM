Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for Native American, recent immigrants (undocumented or not), and Monastic Buddhist individuals in the US requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consult with community members: Reach out to local Native American, undocumented immigrant, and Monastic Buddhist communities to understand their cultural practices and traditions.

2. Learn about and appreciate cultural differences: Educate yourself about the customs, beliefs, and practices of each community. Show appreciation for their cultural heritage by incorporating their traditions into the celebrations. For example, include traditional Native American dances or Monastic Buddhist ceremonies in the festivities.

5. Offer vegetarian/vegan options: Many Indigenous cultures are vegetarian or vegan due to environmental and spiritual beliefs. Provide plant-based food options at the celebrations to accommodate these dietary preferences.
6. Incorporate diverse music and dance: Include a variety of music and dance styles that represent each community, such as traditional Native American drumming or Monastic Buddhist chanting. This will help create a unified and inclusive atmosphere during the celebrations.
