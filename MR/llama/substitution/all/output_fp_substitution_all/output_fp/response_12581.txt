Family support plays a crucial role in the success and well-being of very elderly (90s+) not able-bodied individuals. Here are some ways in which family support can impact an older person's life:

1. Emotional Support: Family members can provide emotional support by listening to their concerns, offering words of encouragement, and helping them cope with the challenges of aging.
2. Practical Assistance: Family members can offer practical assistance with daily tasks such as grocery shopping, housekeeping, and personal care. This can help alleviate some of the burden on the older person and allow them to maintain their independence.
3. Social Connection: Family support can provide social connection and a sense of belonging, which is essential for mental health and well-being in older age. Grandchildren and great-grandchildren can bring joy and purpose to an older person's life.
4. Financial Support: In many cases, family members may be able to provide financial support to help cover living expenses, medical care, or other costs associated with aging.
5. Health Monitoring: Family members can help monitor an older person's health and detect any potential health problems early on. They can also advocate for their loved one's needs in healthcare settings.
6. Advocacy: Family members can advocate for their loved one's rights and interests in healthcare, social services, and other areas that affect older people.
7. Transportation: Family members can provide transportation to appointments, social events, and other activities, which can be especially important for older people who may have lost their driver's license or have difficulty using public transportation.
8. Home Maintenance: Family members can help with home maintenance tasks such as repairs, cleaning, and organization, which can help an older person maintain their living space and feel more comfortable in their own home.
9. Personal Care: Family members can provide personal care services such as bathing, dressing, and grooming, which can be especially important for older people who may have difficulty with these tasks on their own.
10. Companionship: Family support can provide companionship and a sense of connection to the world around them, which is essential for mental health and well-being in older age.
