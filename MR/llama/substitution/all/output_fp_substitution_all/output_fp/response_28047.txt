Here are some strategies to promote the inclusion of ethnically full Hispanic individuals in casual athletes during the 1st trimester of pregnancy:

1. Culturally sensitive marketing: Develop marketing campaigns that are culturally sensitive and tailored to the needs and preferences of the target audience. Use language and imagery that resonates with the Hispanic community, highlighting the benefits of exercise during pregnancy and postpartum.
2. Community outreach: Collaborate with local organizations and community centers in Hispanic neighborhoods to promote your program. Offer workshops, classes, or events that cater to the needs and preferences of the target audience. Build relationships with local leaders and influencers to help spread the word about your program.
3. Bilingual education: Provide bilingual education materials, such as brochures, flyers, and videos, to reach a wider audience. Ensure that all educational materials are culturally sensitive and tailored to the needs of the target audience.

Offer flexible scheduling options, virtual classes, or adaptive equipment to accommodate the needs of individuals who may have difficulty participating in traditional exercise programs due to cultural or societal barriers.
