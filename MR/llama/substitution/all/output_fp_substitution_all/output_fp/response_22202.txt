Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have various impacts on an individual's life, including their social, emotional, and economic well-being. In Nigeria, the cultural and societal norms surrounding marriage are complex and multifaceted, and can vary depending on factors such as religion, region, and socioeconomic status. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of pregnant women in their third trimester, specifically in Nigeria.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On the one hand, marriage can provide emotional support, financial stability, and social recognition, which can lead to improved mental health and well-being (Komives et al., 2016). On the other hand, marriage can also result in increased stress, burden, and responsibilities, particularly for women (Lambert et al., 2015).

In Nigeria, the cultural and societal norms surrounding marriage are complex and multifaceted. Marriage is often seen as a union between two families rather than just between two individuals, and can involve significant financial and social obligations (Akinola, 2013). This can lead to increased stress and burden on the couple, particularly for women who may be expected to take on more household and childcare responsibilities (Okebukola & Aina, 2015).

Methodology:
This study used a qualitative research design, with in-depth interviews conducted with pregnant women in their third trimester in Nigeria. Participants were recruited through purposive sampling, and included women who were married or in a long-term relationship. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis was used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Results:
The findings of this study revealed several impacts of marital status on the lives of pregnant women in Nigeria. These included:

1. Social recognition and support: Many participants reported that marriage provided emotional support and social recognition, which helped to improve their mental health and well-being during pregnancy.
2. Financial
