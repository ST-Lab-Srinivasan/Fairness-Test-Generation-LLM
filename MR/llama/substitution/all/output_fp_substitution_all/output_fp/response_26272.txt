Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers with a mixed Hispanic heritage can be achieved by incorporating elements that reflect their diverse backgrounds and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate music, dance, and art from different Latin American countries: Highlight the unique cultural practices and traditions of each country, such as Mexican mariachi, Puerto Rican salsa, Dominican bachata, or Cuban son. This will help attendees appreciate the diversity within the Hispanic community.
2. Offer bilingual programming: Provide content in both English and Spanish to cater to individuals with varying proficiency levels. This can include language classes, cultural workshops, or interactive activities.
3. Foster intercultural dialogue: Create a space for attendees to share their experiences, traditions, and perspectives. Encourage cross-cultural exchange and mutual understanding through panel discussions, roundtable conversations, or small group discussions.
4. Showcase diverse role models: Highlight the achievements and contributions of individuals with mixed Hispanic heritage who have made significant impacts in various fields, such as business, politics, arts, and sports. This can inspire attendees and encourage them to pursue their passions.
5. Provide resources for identity exploration: Offer workshops or activities that help attendees explore their cultural identity and express themselves creatively.

6. Encourage collaboration: Organize events or projects that bring together individuals with different backgrounds and experiences. This can foster a sense of belonging and promote cross-cultural understanding.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that exist within the Hispanic community, particularly those related to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Ensure that your programs are inclusive and respectful of these differences.
8. Offer adaptable programming: Be flexible and accommodating for attendees with varying abilities or accessibility needs. Provide accessible seating, braille materials,
