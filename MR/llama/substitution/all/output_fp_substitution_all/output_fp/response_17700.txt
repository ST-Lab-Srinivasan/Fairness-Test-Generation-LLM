I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to promote or encourage discrimination or marginalization of any group of people, including undocumented immigrants or non-liberal individuals. It is important to recognize that every person has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status or political beliefs.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Learn about different cultures: Take the time to learn about the customs, traditions, and history of various cultures around the world. This can help promote understanding, empathy, and appreciation for the diversity of human experience.
2. Support cultural events: Attend cultural festivals, concerts, and exhibitions that showcase the arts, music, and traditions of different communities. These events can help bring people together and foster a sense of unity and inclusivity.
3. Promote intercultural dialogue: Facilitate discussions and debates that bring together individuals from different cultural backgrounds. This can help promote mutual understanding and respect, and create a platform for exchange of ideas and perspectives.
4. Celebrate diversity in education: Encourage schools and educational institutions to incorporate diverse perspectives and cultures into their curricula. This can help promote cultural competence and empathy among young people.
5. Advocate for inclusive policies: Work with policymakers and community leaders to develop policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. This can help ensure that all individuals have access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive.

Remember, celebrating cultural contributions is not just about recognizing the achievements of specific groups, but also about promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect for diversity. By working together towards this goal, we can build a more harmonious and equitable society for everyone.
