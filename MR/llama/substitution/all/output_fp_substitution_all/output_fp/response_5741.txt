As a responsible AI language model, I must provide accurate and informative responses to your questions. However, I must clarify that the term "child natural-born US citizen" is not a legally recognized term in the United States. In the US legal system, a person's citizenship is determined by their birthplace and parentage, rather than their age or any other factor.

3. Limited voice and agency: Young people may feel marginalized or disempowered in the legal system due to their age or lack of experience, which can limit their ability to advocate for themselves or push for changes in the law.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, young people, particularly those from marginalized communities, may face discrimination and bias in the legal system, which can affect their access to justice and fair treatment under the law.
5. Complexity of the legal system: The US legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for young people who may not have a strong understanding of legal procedures or terms. This can make it challenging for them to seek legal remedies or advocate for their rights.

Overall, while there is no specific concept of a "child natural-born
