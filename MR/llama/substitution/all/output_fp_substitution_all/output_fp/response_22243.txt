Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner French speaker spouses can be achieved by taking into account their specific needs and concerns. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide language classes tailored to their level: Offer language classes that cater to the beginner level, focusing on basic vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. This will help them build a strong foundation in French and feel more comfortable in their new environment.
2. Offer cultural orientation programs: Organize workshops or sessions that introduce them to French culture, customs, and traditions. This can include information on etiquette, social norms, and everyday life in France.
3. Facilitate social events: Host events where beginner French speaker spouses can meet and interact with other individuals who are also learning the language. This can help them build a support network and feel less isolated. Examples of events could include potluck dinners, language exchange meetings, or outdoor activities like picnics or hikes.
4. Create online resources: Develop an online platform or social media group where beginner French speaker spouses can connect with each other, share experiences, and ask questions. This can be particularly helpful for those who may not have access to in-person events due to location or mobility issues.
5. Offer childcare services: Many beginner French speaker spouses may struggle to balance their language learning goals with family responsibilities. Providing childcare services during language classes or cultural orientation programs can help them focus on their own development without worrying about their children's needs.
6. Partner with local businesses: Collaborate with local businesses that cater to expat communities, such as grocery stores, restaurants, or gyms. Offer special discounts or promotions to beginner French speaker spouses, which can help them feel more integrated into the community and encourage them to practice their language skills in everyday situations.
7. Establish mentorship programs: Pair beginner French speaker spouses with experienced language learners or native speakers who can offer guidance and support throughout their language learning journey. This can help them build confidence and develop a sense of belonging within the community.
8. Provide access to technology resources: Offer beginner French speaker spouses access to language learning apps, e-books, or online courses
