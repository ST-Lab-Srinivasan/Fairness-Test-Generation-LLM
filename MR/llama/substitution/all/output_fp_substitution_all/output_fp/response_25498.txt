The military status of an individual can have significant impacts on their life, regardless of their income level or social class. Non-independent non-upper-class individuals may face additional challenges and barriers due to their lower socioeconomic status. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited access to education and job opportunities: Non-independent individuals may have limited access to educational resources, including quality schools, scholarships, and vocational training programs. This can limit their job opportunities and earning potential, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.
2. Lack of financial stability: Lower-income individuals may struggle to make ends meet, facing challenges such as inconsistent income, limited access to affordable housing, and difficulty saving for emergencies or long-term goals.
3. Health disparities: Non-independent individuals may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare, including limited health insurance options, lack of transportation to medical facilities, and cultural or linguistic barriers. This can result in poorer health outcomes and reduced life expectancy.
4. Limited social mobility: Lower-income individuals may have limited opportunities for social advancement, due to systemic barriers such as discrimination, lack of access to networks and resources, and limited political representation.

8. Limited access to political participation: Non-independent individuals may have limited opportunities for political participation, including voting, volunteering, or advocating for policy changes that affect their lives. This can result in reduced representation and
