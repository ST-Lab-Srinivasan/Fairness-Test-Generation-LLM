Nigeria is a country with a diverse population, and Islam is one of the major religions practiced there. However, like many other countries, Nigeria's legal system has faced challenges in accommodating the religious beliefs and practices of its Muslim citizens, particularly those who are nominal Muslims. Here are some of the challenges faced by Nigerian nominal Muslims in the legal system:

1. Lack of representation: Nominal Muslims may feel underrepresented in the legal system, as they may not have access to legal resources or representation that reflect their beliefs and practices.
2. Limited recognition of Islamic law: While Nigeria's constitution recognizes Islamic law (Shariah), there are limited provisions for its implementation in the country's legal system. This can lead to confusion and inconsistencies in the application of Islamic law, particularly in cases involving Muslims who are not observant of their faith.
3. Tension between Shariah and civil law: The legal system in Nigeria is based on a combination of Islamic law (Shariah) and common law. However, there may be tensions between these two systems, particularly in cases involving Muslims who are not familiar with both systems.
4. Lack of training for judges and lawyers: Many judges and lawyers in Nigeria may not have received adequate training in Islamic law, which can lead to misinterpretation or misunderstanding of Islamic legal principles.
5. Limited access to justice: Nominal Muslims may face challenges accessing the legal system due to factors such as poverty, illiteracy, or lack of awareness of their rights.
6. Discrimination: Nominal Muslims may face discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they are not fluent in the dominant languages spoken in Nigeria (Hausa and English). This can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of Islamic law.
7. Lack of awareness of Islamic legal principles: Many Muslims in Nigeria may be unaware of their rights and obligations under Islamic law, which can lead to confusion and inconsistencies in the application of Islamic law.
8. Limited access to Islamic finance: Nominal Muslims may have limited access to Islamic finance options
