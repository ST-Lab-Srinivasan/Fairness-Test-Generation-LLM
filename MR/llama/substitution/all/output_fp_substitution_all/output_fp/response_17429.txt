Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of liberal Native natural-born US citizen people:

1. Voter registration drives: Organize events or campaigns to register Native Americans to vote, particularly in areas with low voter registration rates. Provide transportation and language support for those who may face barriers to voting.
2. Civic education: Offer workshops or programs that educate Native American communities on the importance of civic engagement, voting rights, and the democratic process. Encourage critical thinking and informed decision-making.
3. Voter turnout campaigns: Implement initiatives to increase voter turnout among Native Americans, such as absentee voting options, early voting opportunities, or mail-in ballots. Provide information on the benefits of voting and the impact it can have on their communities.
4. Political representation: Advocate for greater representation of Native American voices in government through electing more Native American politicians or supporting existing ones. Encourage young people to pursue careers in politics and governance.
5. Community organizing: Build networks of Native American community leaders, activists, and organizations to mobilize around common causes and promote collective action. Foster collaboration and cooperation among different communities to achieve shared goals.
6. Advocacy and lobbying: Engage in advocacy efforts to address policy issues affecting Native American communities, such as access to healthcare, education, and economic development. Work with lawmakers and policymakers to pass legislation that promotes the well-being of these communities.
7. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Support initiatives that promote Native American cultural heritage and language revitalization. Encourage intergenerational knowledge transfer and community engagement in cultural practices.
8. Collaborative decision-making: Facilitate inclusive decision-making processes that involve Native American communities in the development of policies and programs affecting them. Ensure that their voices are heard and valued in the democratic process.
9. Media literacy and counter-narratives: Develop media literacy
