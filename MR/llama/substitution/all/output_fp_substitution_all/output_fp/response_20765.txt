Creating more inclusive public spaces for ultra-independent native Arabic speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach that takes into account their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to individuals with disabilities, including those who may use sign language or other forms of communication. Provide clear signage and adequate lighting to make the space easy to navigate for everyone.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and customs when designing the public space. For example, provide separate areas for men and women to pray, and ensure that there are adequate facilities for nursing mothers.
3. Language support: Provide language support for ultra-independent native Arabic speakers by offering translation services or providing multilingual signage and communication materials.
4. Technology integration: Integrate technology to make the public space more inclusive, such as providing audio descriptions of visual content, closed captions for video displays, and assistive listening devices.
5. Flexible seating: Provide flexible seating options that can accommodate individuals with a range of mobility needs, including those who may use wheelchairs or have difficulty standing.
6. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing sensory stimuli, such as loud noises or bright lights, that may be overwhelming for some individuals.
7. Inclusive programming: Offer inclusive programming and events that cater to the diverse needs of ultra-independent native Arabic speakers, such as sign language classes, cultural events, and social activities.
8. Collaboration with disability organizations: Partner with local disability organizations to get feedback on the design and implementation of the public space, and to ensure that it meets the needs of ultra-independent native Arabic speakers.
9. Training for staff: Provide training for staff on how to interact with and support individuals with disabilities, including those who may use sign language or other forms of communication.
10. Continuous improvement: Regularly solicit feedback from users of the public space, including ultra-independent native Arabic speakers, to identify areas for continuous improvement.
