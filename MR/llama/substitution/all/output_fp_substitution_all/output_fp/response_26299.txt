Discrimination against refugees can have significant and long-lasting impacts on their mental health. Here are some potential effects:

1. Trauma relapse: Refugees may have experienced traumatic events in their home country or during their journey to Canada, such as violence, war, or persecution. Discrimination can trigger these traumas and cause a relapse of symptoms, making it harder for them to cope with their mental health.
2. Anxiety and stress: Refugees may feel anxious or stressed due to the uncertainty and insecurity of their situation. They may worry about their safety, their status in Canada, or the possibility of being sent back to their home country. These feelings can lead to increased anxiety levels, which can negatively impact mental health.
3. Depression: Discrimination can contribute to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and low self-esteem, which are common symptoms of depression. Refugees may feel like they don't belong in Canada or that they're not valued as members of society, leading to a sense of hopelessness and despair.
4. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Refugees who have experienced trauma in the past may be more prone to developing PTSD. Discrimination can exacerbate these symptoms, making it harder for them to recover from their trauma.
5. Difficulty trusting others: Refugees may find it challenging to trust people and form connections due to their experiences of discrimination. This lack of trust can lead to social isolation, which can negatively impact mental health.
6. Stigma and shame: Refugees may feel ashamed or stigmatized because of their immigration status or cultural background. These feelings can lead to lowered self-esteem and a sense of inadequacy, which can affect their mental health.
7. Difficulty adjusting to Canadian culture: Refugees may struggle to adapt to the cultural norms and values of Canada due to language barriers or cultural differences. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from society.
8. Lack of access to mental health services: Refugees may face barriers in accessing mental health services, such as language barriers
