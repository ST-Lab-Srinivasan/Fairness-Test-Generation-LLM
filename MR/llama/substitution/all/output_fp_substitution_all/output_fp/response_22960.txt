As a beginner Chinese speaker and an African American, there may be several challenges you face when interacting with the legal system in China. Here are some potential challenges you may encounter:

1. Language barrier: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively with legal professionals and officials who primarily speak Mandarin Chinese. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and difficulties in navigating the legal system.
