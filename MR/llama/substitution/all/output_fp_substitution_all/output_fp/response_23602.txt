Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of not long-time widowed beginner English speakers. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can impact their identities:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For example, if a person's cultural heritage is Korean, they may feel a strong connection to the Korean culture and community, even if they are not fluent in the language or have never lived in Korea.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can influence how individuals form their identities, including their values, beliefs, and behaviors. For example, a person's cultural heritage may shape their attitudes towards marriage, family, and social relationships.
3. Language acquisition: Learning a new language can be challenging, especially for adults who have already established their identities. However, when individuals are exposed to the language and culture of their spouse through their marriage, they may find themselves incorporating elements of that culture into their own identity.
4. Intercultural relationships: When two people from different cultural backgrounds come together in a relationship, their cultural heritage can impact how they interact with each other and form their identities. For example, if one partner is American and the other is Indian, their cultural differences may lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can affect their relationship.
5. Power dynamics: In intercultural relationships, there may be power imbalances due to cultural differences. For example, the partner from the dominant culture may have more social status or authority in the relationship, which can impact how the subordinate partner forms their identity.
6. Resistance and negotiation: Individuals in intercultural relationships may resist or negotiate aspects of their partner's cultural heritage that they feel challenges their own identity. For example, a Japanese woman married to an American man may resist learning English as a way of preserving her own cultural identity.
7. Cultural brokering: In some cases, individuals in intercultural relationships may take on a mediating role between their partner's culture and their own, which can impact how they form their identities. For example, a Hispanic man married to a white woman may act as a cultural bridge between his partner's family and his own.
