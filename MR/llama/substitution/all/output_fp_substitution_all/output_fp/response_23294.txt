Addressing the Needs of Non-Lower-Class Native Arabic Speaker Individuals in Disaster Response: Challenges and Opportunities

Introduction:
Disaster responses are typically tailored to meet the needs of lower-class populations, such as providing shelter, food, and medical aid. However, non-lower-class native Arabic speakers often face unique challenges during disaster response efforts. In this article, we will explore these challenges and opportunities for addressing them, with a focus on how to better meet the needs of this group in future disaster responses.

Challenges Faced by Non-Lower-Class Native Arabic Speakers:

1. Language Barriers: Non-lower-class native Arabic speakers may face language barriers when communicating with disaster response teams, which can lead to misunderstandings and delays in receiving aid.
2. Cultural Differences: Disaster response efforts often prioritize the needs of lower-class populations, without taking into account the cultural differences and values of non-lower-class native Arabic speakers. This can result in a lack of cultural sensitivity and tailored responses to their specific needs.

Opportunities for Addressing these Challenges:

1. Bilingual Disaster Response Teams: Establishing bilingual disaster response teams that can communicate with non-lower-class native Arabic speakers and provide tailored responses to their specific needs.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Providing cultural sensitivity training for disaster response teams to ensure that they are aware of the cultural differences and values of non-lower-class native Arabic speakers.
3. Economic Inclusion: Implementing economic inclusion strategies to ensure that non-lower-class native Arabic speak
