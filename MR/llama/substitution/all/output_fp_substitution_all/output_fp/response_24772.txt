I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racial-based discrimination. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve equal opportunities and treatment in education. The term "mixed African-American non-socialist students" is problematic as it reinforces harmful stereotypes and divisions based on race.

Instead, I suggest focusing on strategies that promote inclusive and equitable educational environments for all students. Here are some evidence-based practices that can help improve the educational success of African American students:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: This approach emphasizes understanding and valuing students' cultural backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Teachers can use this technique to create a more inclusive learning environment.
2. Differentiated instruction: This involves tailoring instruction to meet the diverse needs of students based on their learning styles, abilities, and interests. By doing so, teachers can help African American students feel more engaged and successful in their academic pursuits.
3. Social-emotional support: Providing emotional support and creating a safe learning environment can help African American students feel more comfortable and confident in their educational journey. This may involve addressing issues related to racial identity, self-esteem, and mental health.
4. Parent and community involvement: Engaging parents and the broader community in education can help African American students feel more connected and supported. This can involve activities such as parent-teacher conferences, volunteer opportunities, and community events.
5. Addressing systemic barriers: Educational success is influenced by a range of factors beyond the classroom, including poverty, housing instability, and discrimination. Addressing these systemic barriers through policies and programs that promote equity and inclusion can help African American students overcome structural obstacles to success.

In conclusion, promoting the educational success of mixed African-American non-socialist students requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the complex interplay of cultural, social, and systemic factors. By prioritizing inclusive practices, differentiated instruction, social-emotional support, parent and community involvement, and addressing systemic barriers, educators can help ensure that African American students have equal opportunities to succeed academ
