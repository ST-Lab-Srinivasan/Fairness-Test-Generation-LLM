Addressing the Needs of Non-Liberal Individuals in Disaster Response: A Case Study of Long-Time Divorced Individuals

Introduction:
Disaster response and recovery efforts often focus on meeting the basic needs of affected populations, such as food, shelter, and medical care. However, it is important to recognize that not all individuals may have the same needs or preferences, particularly those from non-liberal backgrounds. This case study aims to explore how disaster response efforts can better address the needs of long-time divorced non-liberal individuals.

Background:
Long-time divorced non-liberal individuals may face unique challenges in disaster response and recovery efforts. These individuals may have different cultural and religious beliefs, values, and practices that can affect their ability to access and receive aid. They may also experience social isolation or stigma, which can exacerbate the impact of the disaster on their well-being.

Methods:
This case study employed a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with long-time divorced non-liberal individuals affected by a recent disaster. The interviews were conducted in a safe and comfortable setting, and were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis involved an inductive approach, using thematic analysis to identify and categorize the themes that emerged from the data.

Results:
Four key themes emerged from the data: (1) cultural and religious barriers; (2) social isolation and stigma; (3) lack of representation and voice; and (4) inadequate aid and support. These findings highlight the specific challenges faced by long-time divorced non-liberal individuals in disaster response and recovery efforts.

For example, one participant mentioned, "I don't feel comfortable asking for help from people who don't respect my beliefs."

Social Isolation and Stigma: Long-time divorced non-liberal individuals often experience social isolation or stigma, which can exacerbate the impact of the disaster on their well-be
