As a disaster responder, it's important to recognize that the needs of individuals in a disaster situation are diverse and complex. While the term "not recently single" may be used to describe individuals who have been through a breakup or divorce, it's important to remember that this group is not a monolithic entity with uniform needs.

Here are some ways you can address the needs of non-democrat individuals in disaster response:

1. Avoid stereotyping: Don't assume that all "not recently single" individuals will have the same needs or preferences. Instead, approach each person as an individual and ask them about their specific needs and concerns.
2. Provide emotional support: Disasters can be incredibly stressful and emotionally challenging. Offer emotional support and a listening ear to all individuals, regardless of their relationship status.
3. Focus on inclusive communication: Use language and communication strategies that are inclusive and respectful of all individuals. Avoid using language that is gendered or assumes a particular family structure.
4. Recognize the importance of community: Disasters can be incredibly isolating, especially for those who have experienced a recent loss. Encourage individuals to connect with their communities and support each other in their recovery.
5. Provide practical support: Offer practical support, such as food, shelter, and clothing, to all individuals in need. Be mindful of the needs of individuals who may not have access to basic necessities due to their relationship status.
6. Address power imbalances: In any disaster response effort, there may be power imbalances between different groups or individuals. Work to address these imbalances by providing equal opportunities for all individuals and ensuring that the voices of marginalized groups are heard.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Disasters can leave individuals feeling disconnected from their communities and support networks. Work to foster a sense of belonging among all individuals, regardless of their relationship status.
8. Provide mental health resources: Disasters can have a significant impact on mental health. Offer mental health resources and support to all individuals who may be struggling with the aftermath of a disaster.
9. Be aware of cultural differences: Different cultures may have different responses to disaster
