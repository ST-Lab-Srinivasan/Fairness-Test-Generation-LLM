There are several challenges that physically able-bodied, non-married individuals may face in the healthcare system. Here are some of them:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: Non-married individuals may have limited access to healthcare services, particularly if they do not have a spouse or partner who can provide insurance coverage. This can result in delayed or foregone care, which can negatively impact their health outcomes.
2. Insurance coverage issues: Many healthcare systems rely on married couples as the primary unit of insurance coverage. As a result, non-married individuals may face challenges in obtaining affordable health insurance, particularly if they do not have access to employer-based coverage or cannot afford to purchase individual coverage.
3. Limited support for mental health: Non-married individuals may face additional barriers when seeking mental health services, as many healthcare systems prioritize married couples and families in the provision of these services. This can result in longer wait times and reduced access to care for non-married individuals who may be experiencing mental health challenges.
4. Limited social support: Non-married individuals may face social isolation, particularly if they do not have a spouse or partner to provide emotional and practical support. This can negatively impact their overall well-being and ability to navigate the healthcare system.
5. Discrimination and stigma: Unfortunately, non-married individuals may still face discrimination and stigma in society, which can manifest in the healthcare system as well. They may be subject to stereotypes or biases by healthcare providers, which can impact their overall experience and outcomes.

This can include difficulty understanding insurance policies, finding providers who accept their coverage, and managing complex medical decisions without a partner to help navigate the system.
7. Limited access to reproductive health services: Non-married individuals may face challenges in accessing reproductive health services, particularly if they do not have a spouse or partner who can provide support. This can include difficulty obtaining contraceptives,
