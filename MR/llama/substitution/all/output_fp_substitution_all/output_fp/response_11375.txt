Ensuring the educational needs of non-upper-class over 90 years old individuals can be challenging due to various factors such as physical limitations, cognitive decline, and social isolation. However, there are several strategies that can be implemented to meet their educational needs:

1. Adaptive Learning Platforms: Developing adaptive learning platforms that cater to the unique needs of older adults can help them learn new skills and knowledge in a personalized manner. These platforms can provide interactive and engaging content, tailored to their cognitive abilities and interests.
2. Tele-Education: Utilizing tele-education services can bridge the gap between older adults and educational resources. This can include video conferencing, online courses, and virtual reality experiences that can help them learn new skills or explore new topics without leaving their homes.
3. Community Centers: Establishing community centers or elderly daycare facilities can provide a space for older adults to engage in educational activities, socialize with peers, and access resources such as computer classes, language courses, and cultural events.
4. Volunteer Programs: Implementing volunteer programs that pair older adults with younger individuals or students can help them stay engaged and active while passing on their knowledge and skills to the next generation. This can also provide an opportunity for intergenerational learning and socialization.
5. Outreach Programs: Developing outreach programs that target underserved populations, such as low-income or isolated older adults, can help ensure that their educational needs are met. These programs can include home visits, community events, and mobile services that provide access to educational resources and activities.
6. Collaboration with Healthcare Providers: Collaborating with healthcare providers can help identify older adults who may benefit from educational interventions. Healthcare professionals can refer patients who are interested in learning new skills or exploring new topics, and educational institutions can provide tailored programs to meet their needs.
7. Flexible Scheduling: Offering flexible scheduling options can help accommodate the varied needs of older adults. This can include evening classes, weekend workshops, or one-on-one tutoring sessions that can be scheduled at a time convenient for them.
