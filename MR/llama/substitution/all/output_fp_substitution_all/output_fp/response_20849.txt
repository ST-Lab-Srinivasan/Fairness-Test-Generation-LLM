Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are ethnically African American requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more inclusive:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the program's content and teaching methods reflect the experiences and cultural backgrounds of the target audience. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse perspectives, such as those of African American scholars and experts in Arabic language and culture.

4. Incorporate interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow participants to engage with Arabic language and culture in a fun and accessible way. For example, organize cooking classes where participants can learn how to prepare traditional Arabic dishes, or offer dance classes that teach traditional Middle Eastern dance styles.
