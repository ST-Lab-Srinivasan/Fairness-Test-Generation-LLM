1. Language classes and resources: Provide access to free or low-cost language classes specifically tailored for beginners, including those from marginalized communities. Offer online resources, such as language learning apps, podcasts, and videos, that cater to their needs.
2. Cultural immersion programs: Organize cultural immersion programs that allow participants to experience Chinese culture firsthand. This can include visits to cultural events, festivals, and traditional restaurants.
