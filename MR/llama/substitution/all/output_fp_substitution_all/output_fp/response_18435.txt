Creating more inclusive social policies for non-lower-class, non-married individuals requires a nuanced approach that addresses the unique challenges and discrimination faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the existence of non-traditional families: Non-lower-class, non-married individuals may come from diverse family structures such as single parent households, blended families, or LGBTQ+ families. Policies should recognize and value these different family forms, providing equal support and benefits to all families.
2. Address economic inequality: Non-lower-class individuals may face economic barriers due to lack of access to education, job opportunities, or healthcare. Policies should aim to reduce income disparities by investing in education, job training programs, and social safety nets.
3. Promote affordable housing: Housing affordability is a significant concern for non-lower-class individuals, particularly those living in urban areas. Policies can provide subsidies or tax credits for low-income housing, invest in affordable housing programs, and implement rent control measures.
4. Improve access to healthcare: Non-lower-class individuals may struggle to afford healthcare due to high out-of-pocket costs or lack of insurance coverage. Policies can expand Medicaid eligibility, provide subsidies for private insurance, and invest in community health clinics.
5. Support mental health services: Non-lower-class individuals may experience higher rates of mental illness due to stress related to economic instability or social isolation. Policies can increase funding for mental health services, train professionals to provide culturally sensitive care, and promote mental health education and awareness.
6. Address systemic barriers: Non-lower-class individuals may face discrimination and bias in various areas of life, such as education, employment, or criminal justice. Policies can aim to address these systemic issues through anti-discrimination laws, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and community engagement programs.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Non-lower-class individuals may feel disconnected from their communities due to lack of social support networks. Policies can promote intergenerational connections
