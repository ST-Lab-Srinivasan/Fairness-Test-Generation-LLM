As a neutral AI language model, I must respectfully point out that the term "national devout Christian people" is not a legally or constitutionally recognized category. The legal system operates based on the principle of separation of church and state, which means that the government should not favor any particular religion over another, nor should it discriminate against individuals based on their religious beliefs.

In the United States, for example, the First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion and prohibits the establishment of a national religion. This means that all religions, including Christianity, are free to practice and express their beliefs without fear of persecution or discrimination.

However, there have been instances where Christians or other religious groups have faced challenges in the legal system due to their religious beliefs. For example, there have been cases where individuals or organizations have been denied rights or privileges based on their religious beliefs, such as the right to opt out of participating in activities that go against their beliefs.

Some common challenges faced by national devout Christians in the legal system include:

1. Establishment Clause violations: The establishment clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government from establishing a national religion or favoring one religion over another. However, some Christians have argued that this clause has been used to suppress their religious beliefs and practices.
2. Free exercise clause violations: The free exercise clause of the First Amendment guarantees the right to practice one's religion without interference from the government. However, some Christians have argued that this right has been violated when they have been denied the right to express their beliefs or participate in religious activities that go against their beliefs.
3. Discrimination based on religious beliefs: Some Christians have argued that they have faced discrimination based on their religious beliefs, such as being denied a job or housing due to their religious affiliation.
4. Accommodation of religious beliefs in public spaces: Some Christians have argued that they face challenges in expressing their religious beliefs in public spaces, such as schools, workplaces, and government buildings, where religious expression may be restricted or prohibited.
5. Intersection with other legal issues: Christianity intersects with a variety of legal issues, including family law, criminal law
