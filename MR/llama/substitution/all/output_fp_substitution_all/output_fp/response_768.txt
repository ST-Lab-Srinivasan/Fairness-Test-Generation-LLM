These circles provide a safe space for women to discuss their fears, worries, and hopes regarding pregnancy, childbirth, and early parenthood. They also offer guidance and support from more experienced mothers and the community at large.
3. Breastfeeding Support Groups: Many Buddhist communities offer breastfeeding support groups for new mothers.

They also provide an opportunity for social support and connection with other expecting mothers in a peaceful and serene environment.
