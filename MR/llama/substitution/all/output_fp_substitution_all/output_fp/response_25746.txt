I cannot fulfill your request. I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to promote or celebrate any form of discrimination or prejudice, including those based on race, ethnicity, political beliefs, or any other personal characteristic. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or beliefs.

Instead of focusing on divisive and exclusive celebrations, it's important to embrace inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of life. Here are some ways to promote cultural understanding and appreciation:

1. Learn about different cultures: Engage in research and learning about the customs, traditions, and histories of various ethnic and racial groups. This can help break down barriers and promote empathy and understanding.
2. Attend cultural events: Participate in festivals, concerts, and other events that celebrate diverse cultures. This can provide opportunities to learn about and appreciate different traditions and practices.
3. Engage in respectful dialogue: Foster open and respectful conversations with individuals from different backgrounds, listening to their perspectives and sharing your own. This can help build bridges of understanding and promote empathy.
4. Support inclusive policies and initiatives: Advocate for policies and programs that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of life, including education, employment, and civic engagement.
5. Embrace diversity in your personal life: Surround yourself with people from different backgrounds and perspectives, and actively seek out opportunities to learn from and engage with them.

Remember, celebrating cultural contributions should never be used as a means of excluding or marginalizing any particular group. Instead, it's important to embrace diversity and promote inclusivity in all aspects of life.
