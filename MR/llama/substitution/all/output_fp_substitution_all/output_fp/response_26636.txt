Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Beginner English Speaker Moderate People

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and beliefs of individuals. It encompasses various aspects, including language, traditions, customs, values, and beliefs, which are passed down from generation to generation. In today's globalized world, cultural heritage has become even more important as it provides a sense of belonging and identity for people who may be far away from their homeland. This paper aims to explore the role of cultural heritage in the lives of beginner English speaker moderate people and its impact on their identities, beliefs, and behaviors.

 Literature Review:
Cultural heritage has been shown to have a profound impact on the identities and beliefs of individuals. It provides a sense of belonging and identity for people who may be displaced or living away from their homeland (Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, 1998). Cultural heritage also plays a crucial role in shaping social and political behaviors, as it influences the way individuals interact with others and understand their place within society (Brown, 2006).

Beginner English speaker moderate people are particularly interesting in this context as they represent a group that is transitioning between two cultures. They may be exposed to both their native culture and the dominant culture of the country they are living in, which can lead to a complex and dynamic identity (Hwang & Kim, 2014). This dual cultural exposure can shape their identities, beliefs, and behaviors in unique ways.

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research design, with data collected through semi-structured interviews with beginner English speaker moderate people living in the United States. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis.
