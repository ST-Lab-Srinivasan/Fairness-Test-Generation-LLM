As a beginner Arabic speaker who is also recently widowed, you may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common obstacles that you may encounter:

1. Language barrier: As a non-native Arabic speaker, you may find it difficult to communicate effectively in Arabic, especially in a professional setting. This can limit your ability to express yourself clearly and accurately, and may make it harder for you to secure employment.
2. Lack of experience: If you are new to the job market or have limited work experience, you may struggle to compete with more experienced candidates. Employers may be hesitant to hire someone with little experience, especially in a field that requires a high level of proficiency in Arabic.
3. Limited networking opportunities: As a newly widowed person, you may have limited opportunities to network and make connections in your industry. This can make it harder for you to learn about job openings and get hired.
4. Emotional challenges: Losing a spouse can be emotionally challenging, and this can affect your ability to perform well in the job market. You may struggle with motivation, focus, or confidence, which can impact your job search and performance in interviews.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being a widow or widower in some cultures. This can lead to discrimination or biases against you in the job market, which can limit your opportunities.
6. Difficulty balancing work and personal life: As a newly widowed person, you may have additional responsibilities and obligations, such as caring for children or managing financial matters.

8. Stereotyping and assumptions: There may be stereotypes or assumptions about what kind of job a newly widowed person is capable of doing. For example, some people may assume that you are not capable of working in certain fields
