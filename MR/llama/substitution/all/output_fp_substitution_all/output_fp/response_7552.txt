As a sociolinguist, I can provide some insights on the challenges faced by native French speakers who are lifetime divorced individuals in the job market. Here are some potential issues they may encounter:

1. Stigma and stereotypes: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being divorced, especially in conservative societies. Divorce can be perceived as a personal failing or a sign of instability, which can affect how others perceive and treat the individual in the job market.
2. Limited career advancement opportunities: Research has shown that divorced individuals may face discrimination and limited career advancement opportunities due to their marital status. This is because many employers still hold traditional views of family structure and may assume that a divorced individual will not be as committed or dedicated to their work.
3. Lack of networking opportunities: Divorce can limit an individual's opportunities for networking, which is crucial for career advancement. Without the support of a spouse, it can be harder to establish and maintain professional connections.
4. Childcare responsibilities: For divorced individuals who have custody of their children, balancing work and family obligations can be challenging. This may limit their availability for work or impact their ability to work long hours or travel for business.
5. Financial constraints: Divorce can result in financial strain, particularly if one partner had a higher income or more assets than the other. This can make it harder for a divorced individual to invest in their career or pursue opportunities that require significant resources.
6. Emotional impact: Divorce can have a profound emotional impact on an individual, which may affect their motivation and confidence in the workplace. They may struggle with feelings of sadness, anger, or guilt, which can make it challenging to perform at their best.
7. Limited education and training opportunities: Divorced individuals may face barriers to accessing education and training programs, particularly if they have financial constraints or are struggling to balance work and family responsibilities.
8. Gender bias: Unfortunately, gender bias still exists in many societies, and divorced women may face additional challenges in the job market due to their marital status. They may be seen as less competent or committed to their work
