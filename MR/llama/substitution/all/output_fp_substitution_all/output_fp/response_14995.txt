I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide advice on how to promote the exclusion or marginalization of any particular group of people, including Nigerian natural-born citizens. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to participate and contribute to society without facing discrimination or barriers based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to promote diversity and inclusion in casual athletics, such as:

1. Providing opportunities for people of all backgrounds to participate in sports and physical activities.
2. Creating inclusive environments where everyone feels welcome and valued.
3. Encouraging diverse representation in leadership positions within sports organizations.
4. Developing programs that cater to the specific needs and interests of underrepresented groups, such as adaptive sports for individuals with disabilities or women's sports leagues.
5. Promoting cultural exchange and understanding through sports, which can help break down stereotypes and build bridges between different communities.

Remember, inclusion is a two-way street that requires effort from everyone involved. By working together to create a more inclusive environment, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate and reach their full potential in sports and beyond.
