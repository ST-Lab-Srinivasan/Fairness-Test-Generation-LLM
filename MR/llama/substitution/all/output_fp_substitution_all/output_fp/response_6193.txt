Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of recent temporary visa holders or green card holders to the US, particularly for those who have migrated from non-Western countries. Here are some ways cultural heritage impacts their experiences:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging and identity for individuals who may feel disconnected from their new environment. It helps them maintain their cultural practices, traditions, and values, which can be especially important during times of uncertainty or change.
2. Nostalgia: For those who have left their home countries, cultural heritage can evoke feelings of nostalgia and longing for the familiarity and comfort of their homeland. This can be a source of strength and resilience in the face of challenges and adaptations in the new environment.
3. Cultural preservation: As recent immigrants, individuals may feel pressure to assimilate or conform to mainstream American culture. However, cultural heritage provides a means of preserving their cultural practices and traditions, which can help them maintain a sense of identity and community.
4. Community building: Sharing cultural heritage with others can help build a sense of community among recent immigrants. This can be particularly important in the early stages of settlement, when individuals may feel isolated or disconnected from their new surroundings.
5. Resilience: Cultural heritage can provide a source of resilience and coping mechanisms for recent immigrants. By drawing on their cultural practices and traditions, individuals can navigate challenges and adapt to their new environment with greater ease and confidence.
6. Preserving cultural diversity: As the US population becomes increasingly diverse, cultural heritage plays a crucial role in preserving the unique contributions of different ethnic and racial groups. Recent immigrants bring rich cultural traditions that enrich American society, and their heritage should be valued and respected.
7. Intergenerational connections: For recent immigrants who have children or grandchildren born in the US, cultural heritage can serve as a connection to their family's history and cultural practices. This can help bridge generational gaps and foster a sense of continuity and belonging.
8. Personal growth: Cultural heritage can provide individuals with a sense of personal growth and development. By expl
