Creating more inclusive social policies for ex-spouse green card holders requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the importance of family: Ex-spouse green card holders often face significant challenges in their personal and professional lives, particularly when it comes to navigating their relationship with their former spouse. Policies should recognize the importance of family and provide support for individuals who may be facing difficult circumstances.
2. Provide legal resources: Ex-spouse green card holders may face legal barriers when seeking divorce or separation from their U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse. Policies should provide access to legal resources, such as free or low-cost legal clinics, to help individuals navigate these complex issues.
3. Offer financial support: Ex-spouse green card holders may face significant financial challenges, particularly if they are not eligible for certain benefits or have limited income streams. Policies should provide financial support, such as subsidized housing, food assistance, or job training programs, to help individuals get back on their feet.
4. Promote cultural competency: Ex-spouse green card holders may face discrimination or cultural barriers when accessing social services. Policies should promote cultural competency and provide training for service providers to better understand the needs of this population.
5. Address mental health concerns: Ex-spouse green card holders may experience significant emotional distress, particularly if they are going through a divorce or separation. Policies should provide access to mental health resources, such as counseling or therapy, to help individuals cope with these challenges.
6. Provide childcare support: Ex-spouse green card holders may have children who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Policies should provide support for childcare, such as subsidized daycare or parenting classes, to help individuals balance their personal and professional responsibilities.
7. Offer job training and placement: Ex-spouse green card holders may face significant barriers when seeking employment in the U.S. Policies should provide job training and placement services to help individuals gain the skills and resources they need to find stable
