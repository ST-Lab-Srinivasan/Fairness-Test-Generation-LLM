Advocating for the rights of native Arabic speakers can be challenging, but there have been several successful examples throughout history. Here are a few:

1. The Arabic Language and Literature in Schools Movement: In the early 20th century, efforts were made to promote the study of Arabic language and literature in schools, particularly in countries with Arabic-speaking populations. This movement aimed to preserve the cultural heritage of the Arab world and to promote social justice for native Arabic speakers.
2. The Egyptian National Movement: In the early 20th century, Egyptians launched a national movement to demand independence from British colonial rule. Leaders such as Saad Zaghlul and Mahmoud Mokhtar advocated for rights for native Arabic speakers, including the right to self-governance and the promotion of Arabic culture.
3. The Palestinian Rights Movement: The struggle for Palestinian rights has been ongoing since the early 20th century, with a focus on advocating for the rights of native Arabic speakers in the region. Organizations such as the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and civil society groups have worked to promote self-determination, an end to occupation, and the protection of Arabic culture.
4. The Tunisian Revolution: In 2010, Tunisia experienced a revolution that led to the overthrow of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and the establishment of a democratic government. The revolution was led by native Arabic speakers who demanded greater political representation and economic opportunities.
5. The Iraqi Civil Society Movement: In the aftermath of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, civil society groups emerged to advocate for the rights of native Arabic speakers. These groups worked to promote democracy, human rights, and social justice, and were instrumental in the eventual overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime.
6. The Gulf Centre for Human Rights: This organization, based in Bahrain, advocates for the rights of native Arabic speakers in the Gulf region. They work to promote human rights, democracy, and social justice, and have been instrumental in documenting and reporting on human rights abuses
