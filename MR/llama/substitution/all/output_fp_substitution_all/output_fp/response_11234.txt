4. Audio Description: Offer audio description services for individuals who are visually impaired during cultural events and performances.

6. Accessible food options: Provide vegetarian and vegan options for individuals with dietary restrictions or preferences.
7. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive language in marketing materials and promotional materials to ensure that all individuals feel welcome and included.
