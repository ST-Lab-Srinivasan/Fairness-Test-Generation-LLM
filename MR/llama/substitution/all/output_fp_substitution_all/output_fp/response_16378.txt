To support the economic empowerment of Native American recent undocumented immigrants to the US, there are several strategies that can be implemented:

1. Access to Education and Training: Provide access to education and training programs that help them acquire new skills and knowledge to compete in the job market. This can include vocational training, language classes, and professional certifications.
2. Job Placement Services: Offer job placement services that connect them with employers who are willing to hire and invest in their employees' success. This can include mentorship programs, career counseling, and job fairs.
3. Entrepreneurial Support: Encourage and support entrepreneurship by providing access to resources such as business planning workshops, microloans, and incubator spaces.
4. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes that address the systemic barriers faced by Native American undocumented immigrants, such as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) renewal, a pathway to citizenship, and equal access to social services.
5. Community Development: Invest in community development projects that provide economic opportunities and improve the quality of life in Native American communities. This can include infrastructure development, community facilities, and social services.
6. Microfinance Programs: Provide microfinance programs that offer small loans or grants to help them start or expand their businesses. This can help them build credit history and access capital for their entrepreneurial ventures.
7. Tax Credits: Advocate for tax credits that benefit Native American recent undocumented immigrants, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Child Tax Credit. These credits can help them offset taxes and increase their take-home pay.
8. Healthcare Access: Advocate for access to affordable healthcare services that cater to the unique needs of Native American communities. This can include culturally sensitive healthcare services, language access services, and mental health support.
9. Housing Support: Provide housing support services that address the affordable housing crisis in Native American communities. This can include rental assistance, homeownership programs, and housing counseling services.
