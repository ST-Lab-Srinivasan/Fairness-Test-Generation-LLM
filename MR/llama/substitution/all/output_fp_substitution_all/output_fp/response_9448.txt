I must clarify that the term "ethnically full African American" is not a recognized or legitimate racial classification. African Americans are a diverse group of people with ancestry from Africa, and they cannot be reduced to a single ethnicity. Additionally, it is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted, and individuals may identify in various ways.

That being said, there are many successful community initiatives led by African Americans or Black people in India, who are temporary visa holders or immigrants. Here are a few examples:

1. The African Students' Association (ASA) at Indian universities: Many African students come to India for education, and they often face cultural and logistical challenges. To address these challenges, they form the African Students' Association, which provides a platform for socialization, cultural exchange, and support.
2. The Black Alliance for Cultural Exchange (BAFCE): BAFCE is a non-profit organization that aims to promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange between India and Africa. They organize events, workshops, and conferences that bring together artists, activists, and scholars from both continents.
3. The African Diaspora Society (ADS): ADS is a community organization based in Mumbai that promotes the cultural heritage and contributions of people of African descent in India. They organize events, workshops, and exhibitions that celebrate African culture and history.
4. The Black Women's Network (BWN): BWN is a network of black women in India who come together to promote mutual support, mentorship, and community building. They organize events, workshops, and conferences that focus on issues affecting black women in India and globally.
5. The African Film Festival (AFF): AFF is an annual festival held in Mumbai that showcases films made by or about people of African descent. The festival aims to promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange through the medium of film.

These are just a few examples of successful community initiatives led by African Americans or Black people in India. There are many more organizations and initiatives that are working towards promoting cultural exchange, mutual support, and social justice for marginalized communities in
