Creating more inclusive community events for native Arabic speaker lower-class people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Identify the needs and interests of the target audience: Conduct research to understand the specific needs and interests of the lower-class native Arabic speakers in your community. This will help you tailor your events to their preferences and make them more relevant and engaging.
2. Provide accessible language: Make sure that the language used during the event is accessible to the target audience. Use simple language and avoid jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to them.
3. Offer childcare and transportation: Lower-class people may face challenges in accessing events due to childcare responsibilities or lack of transportation. Consider providing childcare services during the event or organizing shuttle services to transport attendees.
4. Promote the event through multiple channels: Use a variety of marketing channels to promote the event, including social media, flyers, posters, and word of mouth. Reach out to local organizations that serve lower-class communities and ask for their help in promoting the event.
5. Provide free or low-cost food and drinks: Many lower-class people may not be able to afford expensive food and drinks. Consider providing free or low-cost options during the event to make it more inclusive.
6. Create a safe and welcoming environment: Ensure that the event space is safe and welcoming for everyone. Provide clear instructions on how to interact with attendees, and designate staff to handle any incidents or conflicts that may arise.
7. Offer interpretation and translation services: If necessary, provide interpretation and translation services during the event to ensure that all attendees can understand the content being presented.
8. Involve local leaders and community members: Invite local leaders and community members from lower-class backgrounds to participate in the event as speakers or performers. This will help make the event more relevant and meaningful to the target audience.
9. Provide cultural activities and performances: Offer cultural activities and performances that are representative of the target audience's culture. This can include music, dance, art, and other forms of expression.
