Addressing the specific needs of ex-spouse beginner French speakers in education requires a tailored approach that considers their unique circumstances and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Adapted learning materials: Create learning materials that are specifically designed for beginners who are also non-native speakers. Use simple language, visual aids, and practical examples to help them understand and retain the information.
2. Small group classes: Teach beginner French classes in small groups, allowing for more individualized attention and support. This can help ex-spouses feel more comfortable and confident in their ability to learn the language.
3. Native speaker tutors: Hire native French speakers as tutors to provide additional support and guidance. They can help ex-spouses improve their pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.
4. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the unique needs of ex-spouses. This could include evening or weekend classes, or online courses that can be completed at their own pace.
5. Practical language skills training: Provide training on practical language skills such as shopping, banking, and navigating everyday situations in France. This can help ex-spouses feel more confident and independent in their ability to communicate effectively in French.
6. Cultural immersion activities: Organize cultural immersion activities such as cooking classes, wine tastings, or visits to historical sites. These activities can help ex-spouses gain a deeper appreciation for French culture and improve their language skills in a fun and engaging way.
7. Support groups: Create support groups for ex-spouses where they can share their experiences, challenges, and successes. This can provide a sense of community and belonging, as well as opportunities for mutual support and encouragement.
8. Personalized learning plans: Develop personalized learning plans for each ex-spouse based on their individual goals, needs, and learning style. This can help ensure that they are making progress at their own pace and in areas of specific interest to them.
9. Access to resources: Provide access to additional resources such as language learning apps, books, and videos. This can help ex-spouses continue learning outside of class time and at their own pace.
10. Regular evaluations and feedback
