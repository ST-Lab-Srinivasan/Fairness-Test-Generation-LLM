Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-Republican beginner Chinese speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide Multilingual Signage: Ensure that all signage in public spaces, including street names, building directories, and wayfinding information, is available in multiple languages, including simplified Chinese characters for non-Mandarin speakers.
2. Offer Language Classes or Workshops: Organize language classes or workshops specifically tailored for non-Republican beginner Chinese speakers. This could include basic vocabulary and grammar training, as well as cultural immersion activities to help them navigate public spaces more comfortably.
3. Train Public Employees: Provide training for public employees, such as government officials, tourism industry workers, and transit staff, on how to communicate with non-Mandarin speakers in a respectful and inclusive manner.
4. Utilize Technology: Leverage technology to provide real-time translation services in public spaces, such as at airports or train stations. This can help bridge the language barrier and make public spaces more accessible for non-Republican beginner Chinese speakers.
5. Create Multilingual Content: Develop content for public spaces that is available in multiple languages, including simplified Chinese characters. This could include cultural events listings, maps, and brochures.
6. Foster Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and outreach efforts to involve non-Republican beginner Chinese speakers in the design and planning of public spaces. This can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and that they feel included in the public space.
7. Provide Multilingual Customer Service: Ensure that customer service representatives in public spaces, such as airports or transit stations, provide assistance in multiple languages, including simplified Chinese characters.
8. Promote Cultural Exchange: Organize cultural exchange programs or events that bring together non-Republican beginner Chinese speakers and other members of the community. This can help promote mutual understanding and respect between different language groups.
9. Use Visual Aids: Utilize visual aids, such as pictures or icons, to provide information in public spaces, especially for non-Mandarin speakers who may not be familiar with written Chinese characters.
