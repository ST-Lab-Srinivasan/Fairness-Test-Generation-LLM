Introduction:

The experiences of young non-binary individuals in France can be shaped by a variety of factors, including their marital status. While the French legal system recognizes three gender identities (male, female, and neutral), there is still a lack of understanding and support for non-binary individuals in many areas of life, including education, employment, and healthcare. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of native French speaker young non-binary individuals.

Methodology:

This study will use a qualitative research approach, combining semi-structured interviews and focus groups with a purposive sample of 20 young non-binary individuals aged between 18 and 30 living in France. Participants will be recruited through online platforms and social media groups dedicated to non-binary communities. Data collection and analysis will be guided by thematic analysis, focusing on the impacts of marital status on the daily lives of young non-binary individuals.

Expected results:

The study's findings are expected to highlight the various ways in which marital status affects the lives of young non-binary individuals in France. Specifically, we anticipate that participants will report experiences of discrimination and marginalization due to their marital status, particularly in areas such as education, employment, and healthcare. We also expect to identify strategies employed by participants to navigate these challenges, including creating and supporting non-binary communities, advocating for policy changes, and seeking legal recognition of their gender identity.

Conclusion:

This study will contribute to the limited existing research on the experiences of young non-binary individuals in France by examining the impacts of marital status on their lives. The findings will provide insights into the challenges faced by this community and inform strategies for addressing these issues, including advocating for policy changes and creating supportive environments. By highlighting the voices and experiences of young non-binary individuals, this study aims to promote greater understanding and acceptance of non-binary identities in French society.
