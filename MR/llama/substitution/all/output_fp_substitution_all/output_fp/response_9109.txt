To highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish speakers, you can use data to identify common challenges and patterns in their language learning journey. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Analyze learner data: Collect data on the language learning behaviors and outcomes of beginner Spanish learners through surveys, interviews, or online language learning platforms. This can help you identify common issues such as difficulty with grammar rules, lack of vocabulary, or struggle with pronunciation.
2. Track progress over time: Use data to track the progress of beginner Spanish learners over time. This can help you identify areas where learners are struggling and provide insights into how to improve their language learning experience.
3. Compare learner data: Compare the language learning behaviors and outcomes of beginner Spanish learners with those of more advanced learners or native speakers. This can help you identify issues that may be specific to beginner learners and inform strategies for addressing these issues.
4. Analyze learner feedback: Collect feedback from beginner Spanish learners through surveys, interviews, or online language learning platforms. This can help you identify common issues and areas where learners may be struggling, as well as provide insights into how to improve their language learning experience.
5. Use data visualization tools: Use data visualization tools such as charts, graphs, and heat maps to present the data in an engaging and easy-to-understand format. This can help you identify trends and patterns in the data that may not be immediately apparent from looking at the raw numbers.
6. Create a dashboard: Create a dashboard that displays key metrics related to language learning, such as the number of hours spent practicing, the difficulty level of grammar rules, or the frequency of vocabulary use. This can help you identify areas where learners may be struggling and provide insights into how to improve their language learning experience.
7. Use predictive analytics: Use predictive analytics to forecast future language learning outcomes based on past performance and other relevant factors. This can help you identify potential issues before they become major problems and inform strategies for addressing them.
8. Analyze learner segmentation: Segment learners based on common characteristics such as proficiency level, age, or learning style. Use data to identify common issues
