1. Language barriers: As you mentioned, beginner Chinese speakers may face challenges communicating with legal professionals or navigating legal documents written in English. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that could impact their legal outcome.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultures have different norms and expectations when it comes to communication, conflict resolution, and decision-making processes.
