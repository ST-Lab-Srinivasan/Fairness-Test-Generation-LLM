1. Education and Awareness: Raise awareness about the importance of accessibility and the need for inclusive public services. Educate the public, including service providers, on how to accommodate individuals with unknown genetic conditions.
2. Universal Design: Implement universal design principles in the provision of public services.

7. Public Awareness Campaigns: Launch public awareness campaigns to promote the importance of accessibility and inclusivity in public services. This can include advertising, media appearances, and community events.

9. Monitoring and Evaluation: Regularly monitor and evaluate the accessibility of public services for individuals with unknown genetic conditions. Use this information to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjust
