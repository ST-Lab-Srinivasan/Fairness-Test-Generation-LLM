That being said, creating more inclusive community programs for unmarried Marxist individuals can involve several strategies:

1. Acknowledge the marginalization of unmarried Marxists: Many unmarried Marxists may feel marginalized or excluded from mainstream political discourse due to their beliefs and personal status.
