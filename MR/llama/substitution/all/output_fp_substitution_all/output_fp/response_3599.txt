Supporting the economic empowerment of temporary visa holders, including those who are natural-born US citizens but belong to lower-income or marginalized communities, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the structural barriers they face. Here are some strategies to support their economic empowerment:

3. Job Training and Placement: Provide job training and placement services specifically tailored to the needs of temporary visa holders. This can help them develop skills that are in demand in the US labor market and connect them with employers who value diversity and inclusivity.
4. Advocacy and Policy Reform: Advocate for policy reforms that address the systemic barriers faced by temporary visa holders, such as unequal access to education and job opportunities, discrimination, and lack of representation in decision-making processes.
5. Community Building: Foster a sense of community among temporary visa holders by providing safe spaces for connection, support, and collective action. This can help build resilience and create opportunities for collaboration and mutual support.
6. Health and Wellness: Provide access to affordable healthcare services, mental health resources, and wellness programs that cater to the unique needs of temporary visa holders. This can help them maintain their physical and mental health while navigating the challenges of living in a new country.
7. Education and Skills Development: Offer language classes, cultural competency training, and skills development programs tailored to the needs of temporary visa holders. This can help them navigate the US education system, advance their careers, and integrate into society.
8. Legal Support: Provide free or low-cost legal services specifically designed for temporary visa holders. This can help them understand their rights and responsibilities
