Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting children with autism and their families. Here are some ways in which volunteers can make a positive impact:

1. Providing emotional support: Children with autism may face unique challenges and stigmas, which can be emotionally draining for both them and their families. Volunteers can offer emotional support by providing a listening ear, validating their feelings, and helping them build confidence and self-esteem.
