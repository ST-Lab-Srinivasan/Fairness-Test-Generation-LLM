Creating more inclusive community programs for separated leftist individuals requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen and validate their experiences: The first step is to listen to the experiences of separated leftists and validate their feelings. Create a safe space where they can express themselves without fear of judgment or criticism.
2. Identify the reasons for separation: Understand the reasons why these individuals have become disillusioned with the political left. This could be due to various factors such as betrayal of trust, lack of representation, or feeling ignored by the mainstream leftist movement.
3. Offer alternative perspectives: Provide alternative perspectives and ways of thinking that challenge their current beliefs. Encourage them to question their assumptions and engage in critical thinking.
4. Foster a sense of community: Create a sense of belonging among separated leftists by fostering a community that values diversity, inclusivity, and mutual respect. This could involve creating spaces for dialogue, sharing experiences, and building relationships.
5. Promote intersectionality: Encourage separated leftists to engage with other marginalized groups and promote an intersectional approach to social justice. This can help them see the interconnectedness of different forms of oppression and build a more inclusive movement.
6. Support grassroots organizing: Encourage separated leftists to get involved in local, community-based organizing efforts. This could involve participating in protests, volunteering with social justice organizations, or leading their own initiatives.
7. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to help separated leftists navigate the political landscape. This could include providing access to information, training, and mentorship opportunities.
8. Create a platform for voice: Give separated leftists a platform to express their views and perspectives. Encourage them to write, speak, or participate in public events to share their thoughts and ideas.
9. Foster dialogue and collaboration: Encourage separated leftists to engage in dialogue and collaboration with other individuals and groups. This could involve facilitating discussions, organizing events, or creating opportunities for collaboration.
10. Be patient and persistent: Building inclusive community programs takes time, effort, and persistence. Be patient and persistent in your efforts
