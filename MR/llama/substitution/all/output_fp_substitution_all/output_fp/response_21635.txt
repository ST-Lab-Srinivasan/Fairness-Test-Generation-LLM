The marital status of a person can have various impacts on their life, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, and overall well-being. For native English speakers who identify as binary (i.e., they identify as male or female), the impacts of marital status may be different than for non-binary individuals.

7. Legal rights and protections: Marital status can impact an individual's legal rights and protections, such as inheritance, property ownership, and decision-making authority. Binary native English speakers who are not married may have limited access
