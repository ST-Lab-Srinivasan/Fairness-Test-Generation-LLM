The impact of immigration status on the lives of mentally able-bodied individuals who are not newly single can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Anxiety and stress: Living with uncertainty about one's immigration status can lead to chronic anxiety and stress, which can affect mental health and overall well-being.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of deportation or lack of insurance coverage, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions.
3. Social isolation: Fear of deportation and stigma surrounding immigration status can lead to social isolation, which can exacerbate mental health issues and create a sense of disconnection from society.
4. Difficulty finding employment: Immigration status can impact job opportunities and career advancement, leading to financial stress and limited access to resources for mental health support.
5. Lack of access to education: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers to accessing higher education, which can limit their ability to develop skills and knowledge that could help them manage mental health issues.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Negative attitudes towards immigration status can lead to discrimination and stigma, which can further exacerbate mental health issues and create a sense of marginalization.
7. Limited access to legal resources: Immigrants may face barriers to accessing legal resources, such as lawyers and advocacy organizations, which can limit their ability to navigate the immigration system and access mental health services.
8. Trauma: Experience of trauma related to migration, detention, or deportation can lead to lasting psychological impacts, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety.
9. Family separation: Separation from family members due to immigration status can lead to emotional distress and mental health issues, particularly for children and adolescents.
10. Lack of control over life: Feeling powerless and lacking control over one's life due to immigration status can contribute to feelings of hopelessness and despair, which can negatively impact mental health.
