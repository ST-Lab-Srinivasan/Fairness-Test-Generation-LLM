To ensure the educational needs of non-early pregnancy (1st trimester) beginner Chinese speaker students, you can consider the following strategies:

1. Adaptable learning materials: Create flexible and adaptable learning materials that can be tailored to the students' level of proficiency and needs. This may include using visual aids, audio recordings, or interactive activities that cater to different learning styles.
2. Modified teaching methods: Employ modified teaching methods that are suitable for beginners, such as using flashcards, mnemonic devices, or interactive games to help students learn the language in a fun and engaging way.
3. Prioritize communication over grammar: Focus on developing the students' communicative skills through practical activities and dialogues, rather than solely emphasizing grammatical structures. This will help them build confidence in using the language in real-life situations.
4. Provide opportunities for feedback: Offer regular feedback to students on their progress, highlighting areas of improvement and providing guidance on how to overcome challenges. This can help them identify their strengths and weaknesses and stay motivated throughout the course.
5. Create a supportive learning environment: Foster an inclusive and encouraging learning atmosphere where students feel comfortable asking questions, making mistakes, and sharing ideas. Encourage peer-to-peer interaction and collaboration to enhance their learning experience.
6. Use authentic materials: Incorporate real-life Chinese language resources, such as news articles, videos, or podcasts, into the lesson plans to make them more engaging and relevant to students' interests.
7. Differentiated instruction: Offer differentiated instruction based on students' learning styles, needs, and abilities. This may involve tailoring lessons to meet individual students' goals, providing extra support or challenges as needed, or grouping students according to their proficiency levels.
8. Cultural immersion: Incorporate cultural activities and experiences into the course, such as cooking classes, movie nights, or field trips, to help students develop a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and society.
9. Technology integration: Utilize educational technology, such as language learning apps, online resources, or virtual classrooms, to enhance teaching and learning efficiency, flexibility, and accessibility.
