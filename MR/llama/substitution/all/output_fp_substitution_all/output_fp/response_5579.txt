Creating more inclusive community events for people with genetic conditions requires thoughtful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions to make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair accessible, has accessible restrooms, and is located near public transportation to accommodate those who may need assistance.
2. Communication: Provide multiple ways for people to receive information about the event, such as through social media, email, or text messaging. Offer closed captioning or American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Inclusive programming: Plan activities that cater to a wide range of abilities and interests. For example, consider having both indoor and outdoor activities, as well as a mix of structured and unstructured play to accommodate different learning styles.
4. Support staff: Hire staff who are trained in working with people with disabilities to provide additional support during the event. This could include therapists, counselors, or other professionals who can help facilitate activities and ensure everyone's needs are met.
5. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing stimuli that may be overwhelming for some participants. This could involve turning off loud music or dimming the lights to create a more comfortable atmosphere.
6. Accommodations for different needs: Offer accommodations for people with different needs, such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions for those who are visually impaired.
7. Involve participants in planning: Involve participants in the planning process by asking them about their interests and preferences. This can help ensure that the event is tailored to meet the needs of everyone involved.
8. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness on genetic conditions, as well as the importance of inclusion and accessibility. This can help promote understanding and empathy among participants and create a more inclusive environment.
9. Collaborate with organizations: Collaborate with organizations that support people with genetic conditions to gain insight into their needs and preferences. This can help ensure that your event is tailored to meet the specific needs of this community.
