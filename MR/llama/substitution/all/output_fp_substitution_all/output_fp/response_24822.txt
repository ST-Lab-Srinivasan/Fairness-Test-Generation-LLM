The military status can have various impacts on the lives of individuals who are not deeply in poverty, but still face economic challenges. Here are some potential effects:

1. Financial Assistance: The military often provides financial assistance to its members through various programs, such as the GI Bill, which can help individuals pay for education or housing expenses.
2. Career Advancement Opportunities: Military service can provide opportunities for career advancement and professional development, which may not be available in civilian life.
3. Networking Opportunities: The military provides a network of contacts and resources that can be beneficial for individuals looking to advance their careers or start businesses.
4. Leadership Skills: Military service can help individuals develop leadership skills, problem-solving abilities, and communication techniques that can be applied in civilian life.
5. Stress Management: The military teaches individuals how to manage stress and handle difficult situations, which can be beneficial for those dealing with financial challenges.
6. Access to Healthcare: Military personnel have access to high-quality healthcare through the military medical system, which may not be available to civilians without insurance or financial means.
7. Housing Assistance: The military provides housing assistance in the form of on-base housing or housing allowances, which can help individuals save money on housing costs.
8. Childcare Assistance: Military families often have access to on-base childcare facilities or subsidized childcare programs, which can help reduce childcare expenses.
9. Education and Training: The military offers educational opportunities through the Army National Guard's Education and Training program, which can help individuals further their education or learn new skills.
10. Community Support: Military bases often have a strong sense of community and support, which can be beneficial for individuals dealing with financial challenges by providing a network of peers and mentors.

However, it's important to note that military service can also have negative impacts on an individual's life, such as the potential for deployment to dangerous areas, exposure to traumatic events, and the stress of constant relocation. These factors must be carefully considered when evaluating the overall impact of military status on an individual's life.
