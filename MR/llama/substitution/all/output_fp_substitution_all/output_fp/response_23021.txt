As a legal professional, I can provide some insights on the challenges faced by recently pregnant (1st trimester) not low-income professional people in the legal system. Please note that these are general observations and may vary depending on individual circumstances.

1. Lack of accommodations: Pregnant professionals may face difficulties navigating workplaces that lack adequate accommodations for pregnant women. This can include lack of access to appropriate seating, insufficient break times, or inadequate support during work hours.
2. Stigma and bias: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma surrounding pregnancy in the workplace, particularly for high-income professionals. Pregnant women may face biases from colleagues, supervisors, or clients, which can affect their well-being and job satisfaction.
3. Pressure to continue working: High-income professional women may feel pressure to continue working during pregnancy due to financial obligations or societal expectations. This can lead to increased stress levels and potential complications during pregnancy.
4. Limited access to benefits: While some employers offer maternity leave, many high-income professionals may not have access to the same level of benefits as low-income workers. This can include limited paid leave, inadequate health insurance coverage during pregnancy, or lack of support for breastfeeding in the workplace.
5. Balancing work and family responsibilities: Pregnant professionals may struggle to balance their work and family responsibilities, particularly if they have a demanding job or limited support from their employer. This can lead to added stress and potential complications during pregnancy.
6. Lack of representation: High-income professional women may not have access to the same level of legal representation as low-income women during pregnancy-related issues. This can result in limited legal protections and resources for addressing workplace discrimination or other challenges.
7. Unpredictable schedules: Pregnant professionals may face unpredictable schedules, which can affect their well-being and the health of their pregnancy. This can include last-minute changes to work hours, travel requirements, or unexpected meetings that can impact their physical and emotional well-
