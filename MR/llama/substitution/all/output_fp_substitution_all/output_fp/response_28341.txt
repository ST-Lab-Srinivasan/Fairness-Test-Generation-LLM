To use data to highlight the issues faced by non-low-income beginner French speaker individuals, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Create a survey or interview schedule that targets non-low-income beginner French speakers and gather data on their language learning experiences, challenges, and goals. You can use online survey tools such as Google Forms or SurveyMonkey to collect the data.
2. Analyze language learning platforms' data: Look at the data available from language learning platforms such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone. These platforms often provide insights into users' progress, skills, and preferences. You can analyze this data to identify trends and patterns among non-low-income beginner French speakers.
3. Use existing research: Review existing research on language learning, particularly in the context of non-low-income individuals. This will give you a better understanding of the challenges and issues faced by these groups and help you identify areas where data can be used to shed light on these issues.
4. Compare data with existing datasets: Look for existing datasets related to language learning, such as the Language Learning and Use Survey (LLUS) or the International Language and Culture Survey (ILCS). These datasets can provide valuable insights into language learning behaviors and experiences among non-low-income groups.
5. Create a dashboard or visualization: Develop a dashboard or visualization that displays data on the issues faced by non-low-income beginner French speakers. This could include information on their language learning progress, challenges, and goals. You can use tools such as Tableau, Power BI, or D3.js to create interactive visualizations.
6. Use machine learning algorithms: If you have a large dataset of non-low-income beginner French speakers, you could use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in their language learning experiences. This could help you understand the issues they face more effectively.
7. Collaborate with organizations: Partner with organizations that work with non-low-income beginner French speakers, such as language schools or community centers. They may have valuable insights into the issues faced by these groups and can provide additional data to support your analysis.
8. Create a case study: Choose a specific group of
