Creating more inclusive housing policies for early pregnancy (1st trimester) singles can be achieved by addressing the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accommodate pregnancy: Ensure that your housing policies recognize and accommodate pregnancy, including providing support for expectant mothers during the first trimester. This may involve offering flexible lease terms, allowing for temporary relocation, or providing access to prenatal care and other resources.
2. Address discrimination: Unfortunately, singletons who are pregnant outside of marriage or traditional relationships may face discrimination when seeking housing. Ensure that your policies prohibit discrimination based on marital status, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic.
3. Provide resources: Offer resources and support to help expectant mothers navigate the challenges of pregnancy, such as prenatal care, parenting classes, and financial assistance. This can help ensure that they have access to the care and resources they need during this critical time.
4. Foster a sense of community: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all residents, including expectant mothers. Encourage social events and activities that promote connection and support among residents, helping to foster a sense of community and belonging.
