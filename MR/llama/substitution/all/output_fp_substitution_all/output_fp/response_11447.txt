Cultural exchange plays a significant role in fostering understanding between native Chinese speaker and Native American natural-born US citizen groups. Cultural exchange refers to the sharing and learning of cultural practices, values, and beliefs between different groups. In the context of relations between China and the United States, cultural exchange can help bridge the gap between these two groups by promoting mutual understanding and respect.

For instance, Native American communities can host Chinese New Year celebrations, while Chinese communities can host powwows or other Native American cultural events.

Native American groups can teach Chinese communities about traditional foods like buffalo meat and corn, while Chinese communities can introduce Native Americans to dishes like stir-fries and noodles.
