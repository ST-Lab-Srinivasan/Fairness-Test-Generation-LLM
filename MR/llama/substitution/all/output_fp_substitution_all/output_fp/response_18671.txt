As a language model, I cannot express personal opinions or make recommendations for specific policy changes. However, I can provide some general suggestions that may be beneficial for native English speaker deaf communities:

1. Access to quality education: Ensure that deaf and hard of hearing students have access to qualified teachers, appropriate accommodations, and accessible educational materials. This could include sign language interpretation, captioned videos, or braille materials.
2. Healthcare services: Provide adequate healthcare services specifically tailored to the needs of deaf and hard of hearing individuals. This could include trained medical interpreters, braille or large print patient education materials, and accommodations for hearing tests and medical procedures.
3. Employment opportunities: Encourage employers to provide reasonable accommodations for deaf and hard of hearing employees, such as sign language interpretation, telecommuting options, or braille job descriptions. This could help increase access to employment and reduce the unemployment rate among this community.
4. Social security benefits: Ensure that deaf and hard of hearing individuals are eligible for social security benefits, including disability payments and retirement benefits. Provide accessible communication methods for these individuals to apply for benefits or appeal decisions.
5. Public safety: Implement measures to ensure the safety of deaf and hard of hearing individuals in public settings, such as emergency warning systems with visual alerts or vibrations, and trained interpreters at police stations or fire departments.
6. Transportation accessibility: Provide accessible transportation options, including sign language-trained drivers, audio signals for bus stops, and braille labels on subway maps.
7. Housing accommodations: Ensure that deaf and hard of hearing individuals have access to affordable, accessible housing options, including apartments with audio or visual alerts, Braille labels on building directories, and trained interpreters for lease signings.
8. Legal protections: Strengthen legal protections for deaf and hard of hearing individuals, including anti-discrimination laws and access to justice measures. Provide trained interpreters in courtrooms and legal proceedings.
9. Cultural preservation: Support the preservation of Deaf culture and language, including sign language education and cultural programs. Encourage the use of American Sign Language (ASL
