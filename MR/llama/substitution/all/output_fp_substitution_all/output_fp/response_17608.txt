As an ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "mildly asexual" is not a recognized or valid term in the LGBTQ+ community, as asexuality is a sexual orientation and cannot be considered a spectrum with different degrees. However, I understand that you may be asking about the financial needs of elderly people who identify as asexual or who do not have a romantic or sexual partner.

To ensure that the financial needs of elderly people are met, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Encourage them to plan for their future: Many elderly people may not have planned adequately for their financial needs in retirement. Encouraging them to create a will, set up trusts, or invest in retirement accounts can help ensure that they have enough money to cover their living expenses and other financial obligations.
2. Provide resources for financial assistance: There are several organizations that provide financial assistance to elderly people who are struggling to make ends meet. These organizations may offer grants, loans, or other forms of financial support.
3. Offer support from family and friends: Family and friends can often provide emotional and practical support to elderly individuals who are struggling financially. This can include helping with household tasks, providing transportation, or simply being a listening ear.
4. Encourage them to seek professional help: If an elderly person is experiencing financial difficulties, it may be helpful for them to seek the advice of a financial advisor or a social worker who specializes in working with older adults. These professionals can provide guidance on how to manage their finances and access resources that can help them meet their financial needs.
5. Advocate for policies that support elderly financial security: As a society, we can work to create policies that support the financial security of elderly individuals. This can include advocating for increased funding for social security and other forms of financial assistance, as well as working to reduce poverty and economic inequality among older adults.

In conclusion, ensuring that the financial needs of elderly people are met requires a multifaceted approach that includes planning, resources, support from family and friends, professional help, and advocacy for policies that support their financial security.
