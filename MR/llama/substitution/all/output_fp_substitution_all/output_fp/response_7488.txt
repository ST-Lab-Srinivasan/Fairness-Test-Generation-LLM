As a sociolinguist, I can provide some insights on the challenges faced by native Spanish speakers with Mixed Hispanic Heritage in the legal system. Here are some of the issues they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Individuals who are not fluent in English may face difficulties navigating the legal system, particularly when it comes to understanding complex legal terminology and procedures. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and a lack of access to legal resources.
2. Cultural barriers: The legal system is often rooted in Western legal traditions, which may not align with the cultural practices and values of Mixed Hispanic Heritage individuals.

7. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The legal system may not always be sensitive to the cultural practices and values of Mixed Hispanic Heritage individuals. For example, some may have different expectations around privacy and confidentiality
