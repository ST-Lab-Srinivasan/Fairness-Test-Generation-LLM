Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner French speakers who are not recently widowed individuals can be achieved by taking into account the specific needs and challenges of this population. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer flexible scheduling options: Many beginner French speakers may have busy schedules or caregiving responsibilities, making it difficult for them to attend traditional classroom programs. Consider offering classes at different times of the day or week, or providing online courses with flexible scheduling.
2. Provide childcare and transportation support: For those who are not recently widowed but have other family responsibilities, finding time and resources to attend language classes can be challenging. Offering childcare services during class hours or helping with transportation arrangements can make it easier for them to participate.
3. Use inclusive language materials: Develop language learning materials that are culturally sensitive and inclusive of diverse backgrounds. Avoid using stereotypes or offensive content, and include examples and images that reflect the diversity of French-speaking communities around the world.
4. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that your language program has a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere. Encourage participants to share their cultural practices and traditions, and provide opportunities for them to connect with each other.
5. Offer personalized support: Beginner French speakers may face unique challenges as they learn the language. Provide personalized support through one-on-one tutoring or small group instruction, tailored to their individual needs and learning styles.

For example, you could offer a course on basic conversation skills, or a course focused on specific topics such as food, travel, or culture.
8. Provide opportunities for cultural immersion: Offer opportunities for participants to engage in cultural activities, such as attending French events, watching French movies, or practicing conversational skills with native speakers. This can help
