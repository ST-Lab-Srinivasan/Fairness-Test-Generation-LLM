Title: The Significance of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Beginner Chinese Speakers with Mixed Hispanic Heritage

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a vital role in shaping the identities and lives of individuals, particularly those who belong to mixed cultural backgrounds. As a beginner Chinese speaker with mixed Hispanic heritage, this essay explores the significance of cultural heritage in my life and how it influences my language learning journey.
