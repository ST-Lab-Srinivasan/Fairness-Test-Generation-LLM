Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting non-democratically employed communities, particularly in areas where access to resources and services is limited. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can support these communities:

1. Filling gaps in service delivery: Non-democratically employed communities often face challenges in accessing basic services such as healthcare, education, and social welfare.
