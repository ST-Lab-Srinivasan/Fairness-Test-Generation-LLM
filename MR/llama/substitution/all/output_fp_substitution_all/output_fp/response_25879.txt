As a social worker, I have encountered several challenges that recent divorcees face in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Lack of support: Divorce can be a stressful and emotional experience, and recent divorcees may feel isolated or unsupported by their healthcare providers. They may not receive the same level of care or attention as married couples or those with extended families.
2. Limited access to healthcare services: Depending on their financial situation, recent divorcees may struggle to afford healthcare services, including preventive care, medication, and specialist appointments. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can negatively impact their health outcomes.
3. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The healthcare system can be complex and overwhelming, especially for those who are not familiar with it.
