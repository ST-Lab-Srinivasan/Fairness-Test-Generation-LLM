Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native Chinese speakers who are also natural-born US citizens. As members of two distinct cultures, they may experience a sense of duality or identity confusion, as they navigate between their Chinese cultural background and their American identity. Here are some ways that cultural heritage influences their lives:

1. Language and communication: Native Chinese speakers may find themselves using both English and Chinese in their daily lives, depending on the context and who they are communicating with. This bilingualism can create opportunities for cultural exchange and enrichment but also presents challenges in terms of language barriers and misunderstandings.
2. Food and cuisine: Chinese cuisine is known for its rich flavors, aromas, and textures, which are deeply rooted in the country's history and culture. Native Chinese speakers may find themselves craving traditional Chinese dishes or feeling nostalgic when they taste them, even if they are living far away from China.
3. Traditions and holidays: Chinese New Year, Mid-Autumn Festival, and other traditional Chinese holidays are an integral part of the cultural heritage of native Chinese speakers. These celebrations often involve family gatherings, cultural performances, and feasting on traditional foods, which can bring a sense of connection to their cultural roots.

This may involve navigating cultural norms, values, and expectations, as well as developing a sense of belonging in both cultures.
5. Intergenerational relationships: Native Chinese speakers may find themselves bridging the gap between their parents' generation and their own, as they learn about their family's cultural heritage and pass it down to their children. This intergenerational connection can foster a sense of cultural continuity and community.
6. Cultural expression: Native Chinese speakers may use various forms of art, music, or dance to express themselves and connect with their cultural roots. This creative outlet can provide an additional layer of identity formation and cultural preservation.
7. Community building: As native Chinese speakers build communities with other members of the Chinese diaspora in the US,
