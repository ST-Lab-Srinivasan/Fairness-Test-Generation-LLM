Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Beginner Arabic Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who are not recently divorced. In the case of beginner Arabic speakers, cultural heritage can influence their language learning experience and their perceptions of the Arab world. This research aims to investigate the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of beginner Arabic speakers and how it shapes their language learning experiences.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can significantly shape an individual's identity, including their language learning experiences (Kramsch, 1993). For instance, research has found that individuals from collectivist cultures tend to prioritize group harmony over individual achievement, which can impact their language learning strategies (Gudykunst & Ting-Toomey, 1988). Similarly, the values and beliefs of a culture can influence an individual's motivation for learning a new language (Matthews, 2003).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from beginner Arabic speakers. Participants will be recruited through language schools and online language exchange groups. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis will involve thematic coding and category development to identify the themes and patterns that emerge from the data.

Expected Findings:
This study aims to identify how cultural heritage influences the identities of beginner Arabic speakers and shapes their language learning experiences. Specifically, we expect to find that participants' cultural backgrounds will impact their motivations for learning Arabic, their attitudes towards the language, and their language learning strategies. We also expect to find differences in how participants from collectivist cultures and those from individualistic cultures approach language learning.

Conclusion:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the role that cultural heritage plays in shaping the identities of beginner Arabic speakers. The findings will have implications for language teaching and learning, highlighting the importance of considering cultural backgrounds when designing language instruction and promoting cultural sensitivity in
