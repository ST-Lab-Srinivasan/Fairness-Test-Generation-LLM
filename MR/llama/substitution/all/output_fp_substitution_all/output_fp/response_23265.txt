Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberal native Arabic speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Public Space Designers: Provide cultural competency training for architects, urban planners, and designers who work on public spaces. This training can help them understand the needs and preferences of non-liberal native Arabic speakers and design spaces that are more inclusive.
2. Incorporate Non-Liberal Native Arabic Speakers in the Design Process: Involve non-liberal native Arabic speakers in the design process through focus groups, surveys, or other forms of community engagement. This can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account during the design phase.
3. Provide Multilingual Signage and Wayfinding: Provide signs and wayfinding materials in multiple languages, including Arabic and other non-liberal native languages. This can help individuals who may not speak the dominant language of the area navigate public spaces more easily.
4. Offer Tours and Guides in Non-Liberal Native Languages: Offer guided tours or audio guides in non-liberal native languages, such as Arabic or Kurdish. This can help individuals who may not speak the dominant language of the area access information about public spaces more easily.
5. Make Assistive Technologies Available: Provide assistive technologies, such as audio descriptions or braille signage, to make public spaces more accessible for individuals with disabilities who may not speak the dominant language of the area.
6. Foster Intergenerational Connections: Create opportunities for intergenerational connections and dialogue between non-liberal native Arabic speakers and other community members. This can help build bridges of understanding and promote a more inclusive public space.
7. Incorporate Traditional Music and Arts: Incorporate traditional music and arts from non-liberal native cultures into public spaces, such as parks or plazas. This can help create a sense of belonging and cultural identity for individuals from these communities.
8. Provide Access to Translation Services: Provide access to translation services, such as interpreters or translation apps, in public
