Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are mixed African American individuals requires careful consideration of their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural program includes diverse representations of people, including those from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. This can be done by featuring images, videos, or stories that showcase the diversity of Chinese culture and its connections to African American culture.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or stereotypical when discussing Chinese culture. Instead, use inclusive language that acknowledges the diverse experiences and perspectives of beginner Chinese speakers who are mixed African American individuals.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a safe and welcoming environment where beginner Chinese speakers feel comfortable expressing themselves and participating in cultural activities. This can be done by fostering a sense of community and belonging among participants.
4. Address cultural differences: Be aware of cultural differences and avoid making assumptions about participants' experiences or perspectives based on their race or ethnicity. Instead, actively listen to their experiences and perspectives and create activities that acknowledge and respect these differences.
5. Provide opportunities for cultural exchange: Create opportunities for beginner Chinese speakers to share their experiences and perspectives with others in the program. This can be done through group discussions, presentations, or other interactive activities that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
6. Offer tailored support: Provide tailored support to beginner Chinese speakers who are mixed African American individuals, taking into account their unique experiences and challenges. This can include providing additional resources or support, such as language classes or cultural events, that cater specifically to their needs.
7. Encourage intercultural dialogue: Create opportunities for beginner Chinese speakers to engage in intercultural dialogue with others in the program. This can be done through group discussions, presentations, or other interactive activities that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
8. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage beginner Chinese speakers to embrace a growth mindset and view learning as a continuous process. This can be done by praising their efforts and progress, rather than just their proficiency in the language
