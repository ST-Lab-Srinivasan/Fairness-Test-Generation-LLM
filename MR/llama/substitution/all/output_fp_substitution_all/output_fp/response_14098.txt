As a small-government advocate, there are several challenges that you may face when navigating the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of understanding of legal rights and procedures: As a small-government advocate, you may not be familiar with the legal system and the rights and procedures available to protect your interests. This can make it difficult to navigate the system effectively.
