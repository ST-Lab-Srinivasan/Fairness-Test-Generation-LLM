The concept of cultural heritage is complex and multifaceted, and it can play different roles in the lives of native French speakers who are green card holders or recent green card holders to the US. Here are some possible ways:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and identity for individuals who belong to a particular cultural group. For native French speakers, their cultural heritage may be an important aspect of their self-concept and can help them feel connected to their roots and community.
2. Preservation of traditions: Cultural heritage can also serve as a means of preserving traditional practices, customs, and beliefs. For recent green card holders, maintaining cultural traditions from their home country can provide a sense of continuity and stability in a new and unfamiliar environment.

For native French speakers, their cultural heritage may include stories, songs, and other cultural expressions that have been passed down through generations, providing a sense of connection to the past.
4. Expression of creativity: Cultural heritage can also be a source of inspiration for artistic expression. Many recent green card holders may find solace in expressing their creativity through cultural practices such as music, dance, or visual arts, which can help them navigate the challenges of living in a new country.
5. Bridge to community: Cultural heritage can serve as a bridge between individuals and their community, providing a shared identity and sense of purpose. For native French speakers, their cultural heritage may be an important aspect of their social life, connecting them with others who share their cultural background.
