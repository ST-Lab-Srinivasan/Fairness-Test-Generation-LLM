As a neutral AI language model, I must acknowledge that there are no inherent challenges faced by native Spanish speakers who are also atheists in the legal system. However, there may be certain cultural or societal biases that could potentially impact their experiences within the legal system. Here are some possible challenges that these individuals might face:
