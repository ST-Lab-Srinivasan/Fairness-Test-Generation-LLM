As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to recognize that individuals who are undocumented in any country are entitled to basic human rights, regardless of their beliefs or background. Discrimination based on someone's religious beliefs or lack thereof is not acceptable and goes against the principles of inclusivity and respect for diversity.

That being said, here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies for recent undocumented individuals in the US who identify as strong atheists:

1. Recognize their human rights: Atheists, like any other individual, have the right to be treated with dignity and respect. They should not be subjected to discrimination or marginalization based on their beliefs.
2. Provide access to education and employment opportunities: Undocumented individuals often face significant barriers to accessing education and employment opportunities. Policies that provide a pathway to citizenship or a work permit can help level the playing field and enable them to contribute to society.
3. Address healthcare disparities: Undocumented individuals often face barriers to accessing healthcare services, including mental health support. Policies that provide access to affordable and comprehensive healthcare can help ensure that they receive the care they need.
4. Promote language access: Many undocumented individuals may not speak English fluently, which can create barriers to accessing services and resources. Policies that promote language access and cultural competency can help ensure that they are able to navigate the system more easily.
5. Address immigration-related trauma: The experience of being undocumented can be incredibly stressful and traumatic, particularly for those who have faced violence or persecution in their home countries. Policies that provide mental health support and psychological counseling can help individuals heal from this trauma.
6. Advocate for legislative reform: There are many pieces of legislation that could be passed to improve the lives of undocumented individuals, such as the Dream Act or the American Promise Act. Advocating for these reforms can help create a more inclusive and compassionate society.
7. Support community-based organizations: Community-based organizations that provide support and resources to undocumented individuals are crucial in addressing their unique needs
