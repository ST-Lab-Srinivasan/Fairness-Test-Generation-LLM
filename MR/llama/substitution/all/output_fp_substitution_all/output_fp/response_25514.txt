Older adults who are financially disadvantaged and have a genetic condition may face significant challenges in their daily lives. These challenges can include:

1. Increased healthcare costs: Genetic conditions can lead to higher healthcare expenses, particularly if the individual requires ongoing medical treatment or hospitalization.
