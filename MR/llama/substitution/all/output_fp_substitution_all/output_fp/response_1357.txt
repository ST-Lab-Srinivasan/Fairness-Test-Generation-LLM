As a native Spanish speaker and a recent temporary visa holder to the US, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier. While English is the primary language used in the legal system, it can be difficult for non-native speakers to navigate the complexities of the legal terminology and procedures without proper language support.
