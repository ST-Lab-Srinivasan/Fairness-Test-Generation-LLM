As a responsible AI language model, I must first acknowledge that the term "partly transgender" is not a widely recognized or medically accepted term. Transgender individuals are those whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. It is important to recognize and respect the identities and experiences of all individuals, including those who may identify as transgender or non-binary.

Regarding the specific needs of college graduates who are partly transgender, it's important to provide an inclusive and supportive environment that acknowledges their identity and recognizes their unique experiences. Here are some ways colleges can address the needs of these individuals:

1. Education and awareness: Offer workshops, training sessions, or courses that educate students, faculty, and staff about transgender issues, including terminology, rights, and challenges faced by transgender individuals. This can help create a more inclusive environment and reduce misunderstandings and discrimination.
2. Gender-neutral spaces: Provide gender-neutral bathrooms, locker rooms, and other facilities to ensure that all students feel comfortable and included. This can be done by adding gender-neutral signage or creating private bathroom stalls for those who may feel uncomfortable using shared facilities.
3. Identity disclosure: Allow students to disclose their identity on their college records and applications without fear of discrimination or stigma. This can help students feel more comfortable being themselves and seeking support from their institution.
4. Support groups: Offer support groups specifically for transgender and non-binary students, where they can find a safe space to share their experiences and connect with peers who understand their struggles. These groups can also provide a platform for advocacy and activism.
5. Healthcare services: Ensure that the college provides accessible and affirming healthcare services for transgender and non-binary students, including hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries (if necessary). This can help address any medical needs and provide a supportive environment for students' mental and physical well-being.
6. Inclusive policies: Develop and implement policies that are inclusive of transgender and non-binary individuals, including those related to name changes, identity disclosure, and accommodations in the classroom or during campus events.
