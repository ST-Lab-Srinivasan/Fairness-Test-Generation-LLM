Introduction:
The military status of an individual can have a significant impact on their life, especially for those who are non-independent and just starting to learn Arabic. In this answer, we will explore the potential impacts of military status on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers who are not independent individuals.

1. Limited access to resources: Military personnel often have limited access to resources such as language learning materials, cultural events, and social activities due to their busy schedules and restrictive rules. This can make it challenging for beginner Arabic speakers to improve their language skills and immerse themselves in the culture.

This can lead to frustration and feelings of burnout.

This can be especially challenging for those who are just starting to learn the language and are not yet comfortable with its nuances.
5. Difficulty adapting to new environments: Non-independent individuals may struggle to adapt to new environments and cultures, which can make it challenging to learn Arabic and navigate everyday situations.
