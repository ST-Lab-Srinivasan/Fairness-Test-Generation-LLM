There are several challenges that advanced individuals over the age of 90 and long-term refugees may face in the job market, including:

1. Ageism: Unfortunately, many employers have biases against older workers, and this can make it more difficult for them to find employment. Research has shown that older workers are often less likely to be hired than younger applicants, even when their qualifications and experience are equivalent.
2. Lack of Technological Skills: The job market is becoming increasingly reliant on technology, and older workers may struggle to keep up with the latest software and hardware. This can make it difficult for them to compete with younger workers who are more familiar with these tools.
3. Health Issues: Older workers may face health issues that make it difficult for them to work long hours or perform physically demanding tasks. This can limit their job options and make it harder for them to find employment.
4. Limited Networks: Long-term refugees may have limited social networks in their host country, which can make it more difficult for them to find job opportunities. They may also face challenges related to language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination.
5. Lack of Access to Education and Training: Many older workers and long-term refugees may lack access to education and training programs that can help them acquire new skills and knowledge. This can make it harder for them to compete in the job market.
6. Limited Job Opportunities: There may be limited job opportunities available for advanced individuals over the age of 90 and long-term refugees, particularly in certain industries or locations.
7. Stereotyping and Bias: Unfortunately, there is still a lot of stereotyping and bias against older workers and long-term refugees in the job market. This can lead to discrimination and limit their opportunities for employment.
8. Difficulty Adapting to Changing Work Environments: Older workers and long-term refugees may find it challenging to adapt to changing work environments, such as flexible work arrangements or remote work.
9. Limited Access to Job Resources: Older workers and long-term refugees may have limited access to job resources such as job listings, networking opportunities, and career fairs
