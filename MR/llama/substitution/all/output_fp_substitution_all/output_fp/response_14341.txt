Supporting the social inclusion of beginner Chinese speakers, especially recently single people, can be done through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language exchange programs: Organize language exchange events or create an online platform where beginner Chinese speakers can practice speaking with more advanced learners. This will provide an opportunity for them to interact with native speakers and gain confidence in their language abilities.
2. Cultural activities: Invite beginner Chinese speakers to participate in cultural activities, such as traditional festivals, food tastings, or art exhibitions. This can help them become more familiar with Chinese customs and traditions, and provide a sense of belonging.
3. Social events: Host social events specifically designed for beginner Chinese speakers, such as potluck dinners, game nights, or movie nights. This will give them a chance to interact with others who are at a similar language level and build friendships.
4. Online communities: Create online forums or groups where beginner Chinese speakers can connect with each other, share their experiences, and provide support and encouragement.
5. Language classes: Encourage beginner Chinese speakers to enroll in language classes, either privately or through local language schools. This will provide them with structured learning opportunities and a chance to interact with other learners.
6. Mentorship programs: Pair beginner Chinese speakers with more advanced learners or native speakers who can act as mentors and provide guidance and support.
7. Volunteer work: Encourage beginner Chinese speakers to get involved in volunteer work, such as teaching English to children or helping out at a local community center. This will provide them with opportunities to practice their language skills while also giving back to the community.
8. Intercultural events: Organize events that celebrate diversity and promote intercultural understanding, such as cultural festivals, concerts, or workshops. This will provide beginner Chinese speakers with a chance to interact with people from different cultures and backgrounds.
9. Language camps: Host language camps or retreats where beginner Chinese speakers can immerse themselves in the language and culture for an extended period of time. This will provide them with a structured learning environment and plenty of opportunities to practice speaking.
