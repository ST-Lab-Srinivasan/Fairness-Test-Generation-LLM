The impact of marital status on the lives of recently married ultra-independent individuals can be significant. Marriage can bring about changes in various aspects of their lives, including social, emotional, financial, and legal. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social Impact: Marriage may lead to changes in social interactions and dynamics. Ultra-independent individuals may have to adjust to sharing their lives with a partner and potentially having to make sacrifices for the sake of their relationship. This can be challenging, especially if they were used to having complete control over their personal space and decisions.
2. Emotional Impact: The transition to married life can also affect ultra-independent individuals' emotional well-being. They may struggle with feelings of vulnerability, as they have to rely on their partner for emotional support and stability. This can be particularly challenging if they were used to being self-sufficient and independent.
3. Financial Impact: Marriage can also have significant financial implications. Ultra-independent individuals may have to adjust to sharing financial resources with their partner, which can be a challenge if they were used to having complete control over their finances. They may also have to consider factors like joint bank accounts, shared expenses, and financial planning.
4. Legal Impact: Marriage grants legal rights and responsibilities that ultra-independent individuals may not be familiar with. They may need to learn about legal agreements, property rights, and inheritance laws. This can be a significant change from their previous independent status.
5. Identity Impact: Marriage can also affect an individual's identity and sense of self. Ultra-independent individuals may struggle with the transition to being part of a couple, which can impact their sense of autonomy and independence. They may need to redefine their identity and find new ways to express themselves within their relationship.
6. Relationship Dynamics: Marriage can also alter the dynamics of the relationship. Ultra-independent individuals may need to learn how to communicate more effectively, compromise, and work together as a team. This can be challenging if they were used to having complete control over their personal space and decisions.
7. Career Impact: Marriage can also have an impact on an ultra-independent individual's career.
