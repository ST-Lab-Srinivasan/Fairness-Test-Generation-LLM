Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of expectant Muslim individuals. It influences their beliefs, practices, and values, and helps them understand their place within the broader Muslim community. Here are some ways cultural heritage shapes the identities of expectant Muslim individuals:

1. Islamic teachings: Cultural heritage can shape how Muslims interpret and practice their faith. For example, some Muslim cultures may emphasize the importance of following Islamic law (Shariah) in daily life, while others may prioritize spirituality and personal connection with Allah. Expectant Muslim individuals may internalize these cultural values and beliefs, which can influence their practices and behaviors during pregnancy and parenting.
2. Traditional practices: Many Muslim cultures have traditional practices surrounding pregnancy, childbirth, and raising children. These practices may include specific dietary restrictions, rituals, and ceremonies. Expectant Muslim individuals may adopt these practices as they navigate their own pregnancy and parenting journey.
3. Community support: Cultural heritage can shape how Muslims build and maintain their communities. For example, some Muslim cultures place a strong emphasis on communal support during times of need, such as pregnancy and childbirth. Expectant Muslim individuals may rely on their community for emotional and practical support, which can help them feel more connected and grounded in their faith.
4. Gender roles: Cultural heritage can influence how men and women are expected to behave and interact within the Muslim community. For example, some Muslim cultures have specific expectations around gender roles during pregnancy and childbirth. Expectant Muslim individuals may internalize these cultural norms and expectations, which can shape their experiences and decisions.
5. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can play a role in shaping the identities of expectant Muslim individuals by influencing how they understand themselves within the broader Muslim community. For example, some Muslim cultures may emphasize the importance of humility and submission to Allah, while others may prioritize individuality and personal expression. Expectant Muslim individuals may adopt these cultural values and beliefs as they form their own identities and sense of self.
6. Intergenerational transmission: Cultural heritage can be transmitted from one generation to the next
