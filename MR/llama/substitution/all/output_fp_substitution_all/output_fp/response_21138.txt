I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to promote discrimination or exclusion based on a person's religious beliefs, race, or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs, should be treated with dignity and respect, and have equal opportunities to participate in professional sports.

Promoting inclusivity and diversity in any industry or field is crucial for a healthy and thriving society. It is important to recognize that a diverse and inclusive environment can lead to better decision-making, increased creativity, and improved problem-solving skills.

Instead of focusing on promoting a specific group of people based on their religious beliefs or ethnicity, it is important to focus on creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected. This can be achieved by implementing policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion, such as:

1. Providing education and training on diversity and inclusion for all employees and stakeholders.
2. Implementing policies and procedures that promote equal opportunities and non-discrimination.
3. Encouraging diverse perspectives and opinions in decision-making processes.
4. Creating a safe and respectful workplace culture.
5. Providing mentorship and career development opportunities for underrepresented groups.

By focusing on creating an inclusive environment, professional sports organizations can promote diversity and inclusion, which can lead to better outcomes for everyone involved.
