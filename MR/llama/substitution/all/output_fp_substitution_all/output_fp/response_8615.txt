Supporting late 30s beginner French speaker communities can be a rewarding and challenging task. Here are some effective strategies that you can consider:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure the community is warm and inviting, especially for beginners who may feel nervous or intimidated. Encourage everyone to participate and support each other in their language learning journey.
2. Offer language classes or workshops: Provide structured language lessons or workshops specifically designed for late 30s beginners. This can help them learn French grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation in a more organized and effective manner.
3. Encourage conversation practice: Provide opportunities for community members to practice speaking French with each other. This can be done through language exchange events, conversation circles, or even just simply encouraging members to speak French with each other informally.
4. Use technology to facilitate learning: Utilize language learning apps, online courses, or other digital resources to help community members learn French at their own pace. This can also help them stay motivated and engaged in their language learning journey.
5. Host cultural events: Organize events that celebrate French culture and traditions, such as movie nights, wine tastings, or even just simple gatherings where community members can share French food and drinks. This can help learners gain a deeper appreciation for the language and culture.
6. Connect with native speakers: Arrange language exchange events or conversations with native French speakers, either in person or online. This can provide beginners with an opportunity to practice speaking with real people and get feedback on their progress.
7. Provide opportunities for personalized learning: Offer one-on-one language coaching or small group sessions where learners can receive tailored attention and support. This can help them overcome specific challenges or areas of interest.
8. Create a community forum or chat room: Establish an online platform where community members can share resources, ask questions, and support each other in their language learning journey.
9. Offer additional resources: Provide access to books, audio materials, or other resources that can help learners improve their French skills outside of class.
10. Celebrate progress and milestones: Recognize and celebrate community
