Ensuring the educational needs of Native natural-born US citizen ex-military students can be a complex and challenging task, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to support these individuals. Here are some recommendations:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Ex-military students often have unique learning styles and experiences that may not be addressed in traditional educational settings. Using culturally responsive teaching practices can help tailor instruction to meet the individual needs of Native ex-military students, such as incorporating cultural contexts and perspectives into lessons.
2. Veteran-friendly campuses: Ensuring that higher education institutions are veteran-friendly can help ex-military students feel more comfortable and supported in their academic endeavors. This can involve providing dedicated spaces for veterans, offering veteran-specific support services, and recognizing the unique experiences and skills of veteran students.

This can involve collaborating with tribal leaders, elders, and community members to design and deliver educational programming.

This can involve pairing students with successful Native veterans or other mentors who can offer guidance and encouragement throughout their academic journey.
7. Interdisciplinary coursework: Many Native ex-military students may have a wide range of interests and goals, which can make it challenging to find traditional majors or programs that align
