Ex-spouse wheelchair-using individuals may face a variety of challenges when entering the job market, including:

1. Discrimination and stigma: Unfortunately, there is still a lack of understanding and empathy towards people with disabilities in many workplaces and societies. Ex-spouses who use wheelchairs may face discrimination, stigma, or biases from potential employers, colleagues, or clients.
2. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the nature of their disability, ex-spouses may have limited job opportunities due to physical limitations or lack of accommodations in the workplace. They may also face barriers in accessing certain industries or positions.
3. Lack of accessibility in the workplace: Many workplaces are not equipped with proper accessibility features, such as ramps, elevators, or adapted workspaces, making it difficult for ex-spouses to perform their job duties.
4. Insufficient support and resources: Ex-spouses may require additional support and resources, such as accommodations, adaptive equipment, or assistive technology, to perform their job duties effectively. However, these resources may not always be available or accessible.
5. Career advancement challenges: Ex-spouses may face difficulties in advancing their careers due to discrimination, lack of opportunities, or insufficient support and resources. They may also encounter barriers in pursuing certain fields or positions that require specific skills or abilities.
6. Social isolation: Ex-spouses may experience social isolation in the workplace, particularly if they are the only wheelchair user in their work environment. This can lead to feelings of exclusion and marginalization, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.
7. Unconscious biases: Ex-spouses may encounter unconscious biases from potential employers or colleagues, who may make assumptions about their abilities based on their disability. These biases can lead to unfair treatment or discrimination in the workplace.
8. Lack of representation and role models: Ex-spouses may have limited opportunities to see themselves represented in leadership positions or as successful professionals with disabilities. This lack of representation and role models can make it difficult for them to envision themselves in these roles
