Promoting the financial stability of older adults, particularly those over the age of 90, is crucial to ensure they can maintain their quality of life and continue to enjoy their golden years. As a financial advisor, here are some strategies I would recommend to promote the financial stability of advanced aged native English speaker individuals:

1. Encourage retirement planning: Many older adults may not have started saving for retirement early enough, which can lead to a significant shortfall in their retirement funds. Encourage them to review their retirement goals and develop a plan to reach those goals. This can include maximizing their retirement accounts, such as 401(k) or IRA, and considering other investment vehicles like annuities or real estate.
2. Optimize Social Security benefits: Social Security is a crucial source of income for many older adults. Help them understand the optimal time to start receiving benefits, based on their age, health, and financial goals. Encourage them to consider delaying benefits if possible, as this can increase their monthly payments.
3. Manage debt: Older adults may have accumulated debt over their lifetime, such as mortgages, credit cards, or personal loans. Work with them to create a plan to manage and pay off these debts, possibly by consolidating them into a single loan with a lower interest rate or by using a reverse mortgage.
4. Develop an investment strategy: Older adults may have a significant portion of their wealth invested in traditional assets like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Encourage them to diversify their portfolio by exploring alternative investments such as real estate, private equity, or hedge funds. This can help reduce risk and increase potential returns.
5. Consider long-term care planning: As people age, they may need assistance with daily tasks like bathing, dressing, or managing medications. Encourage older adults to plan for long-term care by considering options like long-term care insurance, which can help cover the costs of caregiving services.
6. Review estate planning documents: Older adults may have outdated wills, powers of attorney, or other estate planning documents. Encourage them to review these documents and update them as necessary
