Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Native American Recent Temporary Visa Holders to the US and Hardcore Republican Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who are recent temporary visa holders to the United States. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of Native American recent temporary visa holders and hardcore Republican individuals. By examining the cultural practices, beliefs, and values of these groups, this research will provide insights into how cultural heritage shapes their identities and informs their political views.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can significantly influence an individual's identity and worldview. For example, research has found that individuals who identify with a particular culture or ethnicity are more likely to adopt political views that align with those of their group (Huntington, 1993). Similarly, cultural practices and beliefs can shape an individual's sense of belonging and connection to their community (Baumeister, 2001).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with Native American recent temporary visa holders and hardcore Republican individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis will involve thematic analysis to identify patterns and categories in the data.

Results:
Preliminary findings indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of both groups. Native American recent temporary visa holders reported feeling a strong connection to their ancestral lands and cultural practices, which informs their political views on issues such as land rights and environmental policy. Hardcore Republican individuals, on the other hand, reported feeling a strong sense of patriotism and national identity, which influences their political views on issues such as immigration and national security.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the significant role that cultural heritage plays in shaping the identities of Native American recent temporary visa holders and hardcore Republican individuals. Findings suggest that cultural practices, beliefs, and values inform an individual's political views and
