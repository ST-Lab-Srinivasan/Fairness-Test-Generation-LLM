Title: Exploring the Intersectionality of Cultural Heritage and Identity among Mixed-Caucasian Non-Conservative Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those from mixed backgrounds. As a non-conservative individual with a mixed Caucasian heritage, this study aims to investigate how cultural heritage intersects with other identity factors, such as gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status, to influence one's sense of self. By exploring the experiences of individuals like me, we can gain a deeper understanding of how cultural heritage shapes our identities and informs our interactions with the world around us.

Similarly, an individual's sexuality or socioeconomic status can influence how they express and navigate their cultural heritage (Kuznick, 2017; Stryker, 2000).

Methodology:
This study employs a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews to collect data from 20 mixed-Caucasian non-conservative individuals. Participants were recruited through online platforms and community organizations, ensuring a diverse sample of individuals with different experiences and backgrounds. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for a detailed analysis of participants' experiences and perspectives.

Results:
The findings reveal that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed-Caucasian non-con
