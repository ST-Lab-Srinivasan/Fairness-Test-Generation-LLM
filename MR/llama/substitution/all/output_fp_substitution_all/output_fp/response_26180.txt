There are several challenges that moderate native Chinese speakers may face in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the local language of the jurisdiction they are dealing with, communicating with legal professionals and understanding legal documents can be a significant challenge. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and missed opportunities for legal protections.
