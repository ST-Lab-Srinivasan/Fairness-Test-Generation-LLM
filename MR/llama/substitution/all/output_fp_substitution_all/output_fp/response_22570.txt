As a language model, I cannot advocate for specific legislative changes. However, I can provide some suggestions based on the challenges faced by beginner Chinese speaker active-duty communities:

1. Provide access to Mandarin language training: The US government could invest in providing high-quality Mandarin language training programs for military personnel. This could include immersion programs, online courses, or language exchange opportunities with native speakers.
2. Offer language proficiency testing and certification: Developing a standardized language proficiency test for Mandarin Chinese could help identify the language skills of military personnel and provide a way to track progress over time. This could also lead to certification programs that recognize individuals who have achieved a certain level of proficiency.
3. Promote cultural exchange programs: Encouraging cultural exchange programs between the US and China could help military personnel develop a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and language. These programs could include study abroad opportunities, language immersion programs, or cultural events.
4. Create virtual learning environments: With the advancement of technology, it is now possible to create virtual learning environments that can facilitate language learning for active-duty military personnel. This could include online courses, virtual language exchange programs, and mobile apps that provide interactive language learning experiences.
5. Offer language training scholarships: Providing scholarships for language training could help encourage more military personnel to pursue language proficiency. These scholarships could be used to cover the costs of language courses, language study abroad programs, or other language learning opportunities.
6. Develop language learning apps: Creating mobile apps that provide interactive language learning experiences could be a useful tool for beginner Chinese speaker active-duty communities. These apps could include games, quizzes, and other activities designed to help learners improve their language skills.
7. Encourage language use in military operations: Encouraging the use of Mandarin Chinese in military operations could help build fluency and confidence among beginner speakers. This could involve using Mandarin Chinese in communication with local partners or during joint military exercises with Chinese forces.
8. Provide language support for military families: Military families often face unique challenges when it comes to language learning. Providing language support services, such as tutoring or language exchange programs, could help military families develop their Mandarin Chinese skills and
