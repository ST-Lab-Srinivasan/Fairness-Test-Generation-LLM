The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents who have been married for a long time can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Financial Strain: Caring for a disabled partner can be costly, especially if they require constant medical attention or assistance with daily tasks. This can put a strain on the couple's finances, particularly if one partner is the primary breadwinner.
