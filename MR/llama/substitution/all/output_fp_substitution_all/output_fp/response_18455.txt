Cultural competence is essential in healthcare for any patient, regardless of their race or ethnicity. However, for Mandarin-speaking African Americans, cultural competence can provide several benefits that are particularly important:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence allows healthcare providers to communicate effectively with patients who may have different communication styles or preferences. For example, some Mandarin-speaking African Americans may prefer to receive information in their native language or may have cultural norms around communication that are different from those of the dominant culture.
