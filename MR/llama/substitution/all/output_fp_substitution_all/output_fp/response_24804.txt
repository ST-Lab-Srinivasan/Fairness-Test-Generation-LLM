The impact of military status on the lives of non-democratic employed individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited job opportunities: In many authoritarian regimes, there may be limited job opportunities for non-military personnel, particularly in fields that are considered "sensitive" or "strategic." This can limit the career advancement and earning potential of non-military individuals.
