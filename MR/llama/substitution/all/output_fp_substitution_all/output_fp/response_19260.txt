Ensuring the educational needs of temporary visa holders and recently retired active duty military students in the US can be a complex task, but there are several steps that can be taken to meet their unique needs:

1. Understand the Visa Requirements: Temporary visa holders must comply with the terms and conditions of their visa status. Educational institutions should have a clear understanding of the visa requirements and restrictions to ensure that students are aware of any limitations on their ability to enroll in courses or participate in campus activities.
2. Provide Support Services: Educational institutions can provide support services specifically designed for temporary visa holders, such as academic advising, language support, and cultural adaptation counseling. These services can help students navigate the US education system and address any challenges they may face.
3. Offer Cross-Cultural Programs: Educational institutions can offer cross-cultural programs that provide opportunities for temporary visa holders to interact with other international students, American students, and local community members. These programs can help promote cultural understanding, language proficiency, and social integration.
4. Develop Partnerships: Educational institutions can develop partnerships with organizations that provide support services specifically designed for temporary visa holders, such as legal aid societies, cultural centers, and community groups. These partnerships can provide students with access to additional resources and support networks.
5. Advocate for Policy Changes: Educational institutions can advocate for policy changes at the local, state, or federal level that address the educational needs of temporary visa holders and recently retired active duty military students. This can include efforts to streamline the visa application process, provide financial aid and scholarships, and establish clear guidelines for the admission and retention of international students.
6. Provide Accessible Curriculum: Educational institutions can offer courses and programs that are accessible and relevant to the needs of temporary visa holders and recently retired active duty military students. This can include credit-bearing courses, workshops, and seminars that address their unique interests and goals.
7. Foster Inclusive Campus Culture: Educational institutions can foster an inclusive campus culture by promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. This
