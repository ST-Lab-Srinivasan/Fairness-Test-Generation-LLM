Creating more inclusive community events for native Chinese speakers in their 90s and beyond requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide language support: Offer translation services or provide interpretation during the event to ensure that everyone can understand the proceedings. This will help bridge the language gap and make the event more accessible to native Chinese speakers.
2. Involve them in the planning process: Encourage older Chinese speakers to participate in the planning and organizing of the event. This will give them a sense of ownership and involvement, which can lead to higher attendance rates.
3. Offer cultural activities: Incorporate cultural activities that are relevant to native Chinese speakers, such as traditional music, dance, or food. This will help create a welcoming and inclusive environment.
4. Provide accessible seating and transportation: Ensure that the event venue is wheelchair accessible and provide transportation options for those who may need them. This will help ensure that everyone can participate without barriers.
5. Promote the event through Chinese language media: Advertise the event through Chinese-language newspapers, radio stations, or social media groups to reach a wider audience.
6. Offer age-appropriate activities: Plan activities that are suitable for older adults, such as crafting, trivia, or other games that promote socialization and interaction.
7. Create intergenerational opportunities: Pair older Chinese speakers with younger attendees to encourage intergenerational communication and learning. This can help build connections and create a sense of community.
8. Provide nutritious food options: Offer a variety of healthy food options that cater to the dietary preferences of native Chinese speakers, such as vegetarian or gluten-free options.
9. Ensure accessibility for people with disabilities: Make sure that the event venue is accessible for people with disabilities and provide accommodations as needed.
10. Follow up after the event: Send a follow-up survey or email to attendees to gather feedback and suggestions for future events. This will help improve the event experience and create a more inclusive community.
