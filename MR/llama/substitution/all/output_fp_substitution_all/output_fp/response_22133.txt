I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide advice or support on illegal or unethical activities, including those that involve non-citizens or any form of discrimination. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or immigration status.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support and advocate for the rights and well-being of all individuals, regardless of their citizenship or sexual orientation. This can involve advocating for policies and laws that promote equality and inclusivity, as well as working to break down barriers and challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices.

Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and it is important to work towards creating a more just and equitable society for all.
