Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Nigerians living in poverty are met is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented:

1. Increase access to primary healthcare: Many Nigerians, especially those living in rural areas, lack access to basic healthcare services due to the distance and cost of traveling to clinics or hospitals. Implementing a more robust primary healthcare system, with well-equipped and staffed clinics located closer to where people live, could help improve access to care.
2. Strengthen community-based healthcare: Community-based healthcare programs, such as village health teams or peer educator programs, can be effective in reaching underserved populations. These programs often rely on local volunteers who are trained to provide basic healthcare services and promote healthy behaviors within their communities.
3. Increase funding for healthcare: Nigeria's healthcare system is under-resourced, with limited funding available for healthcare initiatives. Increasing funding for healthcare, either through government allocations or international donor support, could help improve the quality and accessibility of healthcare services.

Implement innovative financing mechanisms: Nigeria could explore innovative financing mechanisms, such as social impact bonds or health impact bonds, to increase funding for healthcare initiatives. These mechanisms can help attract private sector investment in healthcare by providing a return on investment based on the health outcomes achieved.
5. Foster public-private partnerships: Collaboration between government, private sector organizations, and civil society groups can help leverage resources and expertise to improve healthcare delivery in Nigeria. Public-private partnerships could be established to provide technical assistance, infrastructure support, or to deliver healthcare services directly to underserved populations.
6. Develop a comprehensive health insurance scheme: A well-designed health insurance scheme can help increase access to healthcare by pooling risk and sharing costs across a larger population. This could help reduce financial barriers to care and improve the overall efficiency of the healthcare system.
7. Promote disease prevention and health promotion: Many Nigerians suffer from non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension,
