Creating more inclusive cultural events for formerly newly divorced ex-military individuals requires understanding their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite ex-military individuals to participate in the planning of cultural events, such as festivals or concerts. This will give them a sense of ownership and allow them to contribute their ideas and perspectives.
