I must clarify that using terms like "moderate ethnically full Asian people" can be perceived as perpetuating a harmful and outdated racial hierarchy. Instead, it's important to recognize and respect the diversity of experiences and identities within the Asian community. Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of individuals from diverse Asian backgrounds:

1. Listen and amplify their voices: Centering the voices and perspectives of marginalized communities, including Asians, is crucial for creating a more inclusive and equitable society. Listen to their stories, amplify their voices, and prioritize their needs in decision-making processes.
2. Educate yourself on the issues: Learn about the social, economic, and political challenges faced by different Asian communities. This will help you better understand the complexities of their experiences and provide more effective support.
3. Advocate for policies that benefit marginalized communities: Work with organizations and policymakers to advance policies that address systemic inequalities affecting Asians, such as education reform, immigration rights, and healthcare access.
4. Support community-led initiatives: Empower local Asian communities by providing resources and support for their own initiatives, rather than imposing outside solutions. This can include funding, technical assistance, or simply amplifying their work through your networks.
5. Engage in anti-racism work: Address the systemic racism that affects Asians and other marginalized communities by advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion.
6. Foster inclusive spaces: Create welcoming environments where everyone feels valued and respected, regardless of their race or ethnicity. This can involve hosting events that celebrate diverse cultures, promoting cross-cultural understanding, and challenging racist behaviors and language.
7. Support Asian-led social justice movements: Recognize the leadership and expertise of Asian individuals and organizations in driving social change. Provide resources and support to help them achieve their goals, rather than imposing your own solutions.
8. Encourage civic participation: Facilitate opportunities for Asian communities to participate in decision-making processes, such as voting, advocacy, and community organizing. This can involve partnering with local organizations
