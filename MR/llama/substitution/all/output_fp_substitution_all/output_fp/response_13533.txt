Lower-class mixed Hispanic heritage individuals face a unique set of challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Individuals from lower-class backgrounds may speak only Spanish or have limited proficiency in English, which can create difficulties when communicating with healthcare providers who primarily speak English. This language barrier can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and delayed care.
2. Cultural insensitivity: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the cultural beliefs and practices of lower-class mixed Hispanic individuals, leading to inappropriate or insensitive care. For example, some individuals may have strong beliefs about traditional medicine or spiritual healing that are not recognized or respected by the healthcare system.
3. Limited access: Lower-class mixed Hispanic individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited health insurance coverage. This can result in delayed or inadequate care for chronic conditions or acute illnesses.
4. Health disparities: Lower-class mixed Hispanic individuals may experience health disparities due to systemic inequalities and discrimination. For instance, they may face higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic conditions compared to the general population.
5. Lack of trust: Lower-class mixed Hispanic individuals may feel mistrustful of the healthcare system due to historical and contemporary experiences of discrimination, marginalization, and oppression. This can lead to reluctance to seek medical care or adhere to treatment plans.
6. Stigma and shame: Lower-class mixed Hispanic individuals may experience stigma and shame related to their cultural background, socioeconomic status, or mental health issues. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care for mental health conditions.
7. Limited provider knowledge: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the unique needs and experiences of lower-class mixed Hispanic individuals, leading to inappropriate or insensitive care. For example, providers may not recognize the importance of cultural competency when caring for this population.
8. Inadequate training: Healthcare providers may receive limited training
