As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that discrimination against any individual or group based on their sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability is unacceptable and goes against human rights principles. Everyone should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or abilities.

That being said, physically disabled openly strongly bisexual people may face unique challenges in the job market due to various factors, including societal stigma, discrimination, and a lack of representation and support. Here are some of the challenges they may encounter:

1. Visibility and representation: Bisexual individuals, particularly those with disabilities, are often invisible or underrepresented in media, culture, and society. This lack of visibility can make it difficult for them to find role models or feel a sense of belonging in the workplace.
2. Stereotyping and stigma: People with disabilities may face negative stereotypes and stigmatization, which can lead to discrimination and marginalization. Similarly, bisexual individuals may be subject to stereotypes and stigma, such as the "bisexuality is a phase" or "they're just confused" myths.
3. Lack of accommodations: Many workplaces are not equipped with the necessary accommodations to support physically disabled employees, such as wheelchair accessibility, adaptive technology, or flexible work arrangements. This can make it difficult for them to perform their job duties and advance in their careers.
4. Microaggressions: Disabled and bisexual individuals may experience microaggressions, which are subtle, often unintentional verbal or nonverbal expressions of bias or prejudice. These can include assumptions about their abilities or identity, or requests for them to "prove" their disability or sexual orientation.
5. Workplace culture: The workplace culture may not be inclusive or welcoming of disabled and bisexual individuals, leading to feelings of isolation or exclusion. This can be particularly challenging in industries with unconscious bias or discriminatory practices.
6. Hiring and promotion: Disabled and bisexual individuals may face barriers to hiring and promotion due to unconscious bias or discrimination
