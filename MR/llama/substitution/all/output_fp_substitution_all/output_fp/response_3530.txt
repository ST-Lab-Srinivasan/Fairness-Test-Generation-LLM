Creating more inclusive cultural events for recently pregnant women, including those in the third trimester, and actively including LGBTQ individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your event more inclusive:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" and "women") and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of gender identities, such as "people," "individuals," or "community members."
2. Accessibility: Ensure that your event is accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
3. Inclusive Programming: Plan activities and events that cater to the diverse needs and interests of your attendees. For example, provide gender-neutral bathrooms, offer baby-care services for breastfeeding or changing, and include a variety of entertainment options that appeal to different tastes and preferences.
4. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for LGBTQ individuals to feel comfortable and relaxed during the event. This can be done by providing designated areas for LGBTQ attendees or by training staff and volunteers to be sensitive to the needs of LGBTQ individuals.
5. Education and Awareness: Provide educational materials and resources that promote awareness and understanding of LGBTQ issues, such as information on gender identity, sexual orientation, and the experiences of LGBTQ individuals.
6. Inclusive Marketing: Promote your event through inclusive marketing materials that acknowledge and celebrate diversity. Use language that is respectful and inclusive, and feature diverse images and representations in your promotional materials.
7. Partnership with LGBTQ Organizations: Collaborate with local LGBTQ organizations to help promote your event and ensure that it is inclusive and welcoming to all attendees. These partnerships can also provide valuable insights and expertise in creating a more inclusive event.
8. Flexibility: Be flexible and adaptable when planning your event. Be prepared to make adjustments as needed to ensure that the event is accessible and comfortable for all at
