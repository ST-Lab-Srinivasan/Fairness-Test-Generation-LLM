Ensuring the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those who are recently divorced, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources to help them improve their French skills, which can be a barrier to participation in decision-making processes.
2. Create inclusive spaces: Organize events and meetings in a comfortable and inclusive environment where they feel at ease expressing themselves.
3. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to help them understand complex information and participate in decision-making processes.
4. Encourage participation: Actively encourage them to participate in meetings and events, and make sure they feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.
5. Build trust: Take the time to build trust with these individuals by showing genuine interest in their experiences and perspectives.
6. Use interpreters or translators: If necessary, provide interpreters or translators to help them communicate effectively during meetings and events.
7. Foster a supportive environment: Encourage a culture of respect and empathy within the group, where everyone feels valued and heard.
8. Provide childcare or other supports: Offer support services such as childcare or transportation to help them participate more easily in decision-making processes.
9. Use technology: Utilize technology such as video conferencing or online surveys to reach a wider audience and make participation easier for those who may face barriers.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of experiences and perspectives within the group, and create opportunities for everyone to share their thoughts and opinions.

By implementing these strategies, you can help ensure that the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those who are recently divorced, are heard in decision-making processes.
