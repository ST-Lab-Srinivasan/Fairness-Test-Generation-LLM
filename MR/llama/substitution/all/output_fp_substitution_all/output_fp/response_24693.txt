As a compassionate and inclusive society, it is important to ensure that the housing needs of non-citizen seniors (individuals aged 65 and older) are met. Here are some steps that can be taken to address this issue:

1. Provide access to affordable housing options: Non-citizen seniors may face barriers in accessing affordable housing due to their immigration status. Governments and non-profit organizations can work together to provide affordable housing options, such as subsidized rentals or cooperative housing, that are available to all seniors, regardless of their immigration status.
2. Offer language training and cultural adaptation programs: Many non-citizen seniors may face challenges in navigating the healthcare system and accessing social services due to language barriers. Providing language training and cultural adaptation programs can help them better understand their rights and access available resources.
3. Ensure access to healthcare services: Non-citizen seniors may have limited access to healthcare services due to their immigration status. Governments can work to ensure that all seniors have access to quality, affordable healthcare, regardless of their immigration status.
4. Provide legal support and advocacy: Many non-citizen seniors may face legal barriers in accessing social services or experiencing discrimination due to their immigration status. Providing legal support and advocacy can help them navigate the legal system and access their rights.
5. Promote inclusive community engagement: Non-citizen seniors may feel isolated or excluded from their communities due to their immigration status. Governments and community organizations can work to promote inclusive community engagement, such as intergenerational programs, cultural events, and volunteer opportunities, that bring together people of all ages and backgrounds.
6. Address systemic barriers: Non-citizen seniors may face systemic barriers in accessing social services due to their immigration status. Governments can work to address these barriers by implementing policies that promote inclusivity and equity, such as removing citizenship requirements for certain services or providing alternative forms of identification for those who do not have a valid Canadian passport.
7. Advocate for policy change: Non-citizen seniors may face significant barriers in accessing housing, healthcare, and other social services
