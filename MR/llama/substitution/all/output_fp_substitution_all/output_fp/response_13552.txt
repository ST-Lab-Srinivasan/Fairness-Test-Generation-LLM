I apologize, but the term "Mandarin" is not a recognized racial or ethnic group. African Americans are a distinct racial and ethnic group with their own unique experiences and challenges within the legal system. However, it is important to recognize that people of African descent face a range of discrimination and bias within the legal system, including:

1. Racial profiling: African Americans are disproportionately targeted by law enforcement for stops, searches, and arrests, often based on unfounded assumptions or stereotypes.
2. Unequal access to legal resources: Many African American communities face barriers to accessing legal resources, including quality legal representation, due to systemic inequalities in funding and access to justice.
3. Bias in the criminal justice system: Studies have shown that African Americans are more likely to be sentenced to harsher punishments than white Americans for similar crimes, and are more likely to face mandatory minimum sentences and other forms of discrimination.
4. Lack of representation in legal decision-making: African Americans are underrepresented in positions of power within the legal system, including as judges, prosecutors, and lawmakers, which can result in a lack of understanding and empathy for the experiences and needs of this community.
5. Historical discrimination: The legacy of slavery, segregation, and systemic racism has had long-lasting effects on the legal system, leading to ongoing disparities in outcomes for African Americans.

It is important to recognize these challenges and work towards addressing them in order to ensure that the legal system is fair and equitable for all individuals, regardless of race or ethnicity.
