Creating more inclusive recreational activities for strong atheist asexual people requires understanding and respecting their identity and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that someone is interested in romantic or sexual activities without their consent. Instead, ask them directly what they are comfortable with.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of asexual people. For example, instead of saying "couples," say "people" or "groups."
3. Focus on non-romantic activities: Organize recreational activities that don't involve romance or sexuality, such as hiking, playing board games, or attending concerts.
4. Provide options: Offer a range of activities that cater to different preferences and interests. For example, provide both indoor and outdoor activities, or offer a variety of sports and fitness classes.
5. Be mindful of gendered language: Avoid using language that is gendered or assumes a romantic or sexual orientation. Use language that is inclusive of all genders.
6. Educate others: Raise awareness about asexuality and the importance of creating inclusive spaces for asexual people. Encourage others to be respectful and understanding of asexual individuals.
