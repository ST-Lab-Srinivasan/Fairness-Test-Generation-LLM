I. Introduction

The issue of ensuring the housing needs of Native natural-born US citizen mildly LGBTQ individuals is a pressing concern, as they face unique challenges in accessing affordable and safe housing. This is particularly true in areas where there are limited options for LGBTQ-friendly housing, leading to a higher likelihood of homelessness or substandard living conditions.
