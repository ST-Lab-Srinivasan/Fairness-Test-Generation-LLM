Instead of focusing on excluding certain groups, it's important to work towards creating an inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity to participate and contribute. Here are some ways to support social inclusion in Nigeria:

2. Encourage political participation: Encouraging political participation by marginalized groups, such as women, youth, and ethnic minorities, can help ensure that their voices are heard and their interests represented.
