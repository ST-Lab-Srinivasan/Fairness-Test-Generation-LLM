Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout Muslim Nigerians requires a thoughtful and respectful approach that acknowledges their unique cultural background and religious beliefs. Here are some suggestions on how to achieve this:

1. Engage in active listening: Listen to the needs, concerns, and values of the devout Muslim community in Nigeria. This will help you understand what programs or activities would be most meaningful and relevant to them.
2. Consult with community leaders: Reach out to religious leaders and community elders within the devout Muslim community. They can provide valuable insights into the community's cultural practices and beliefs, which can help inform your program design.
3. Incorporate Islamic values and practices: Ensure that any programs or activities you develop are respectful of Islamic values and practices. This may involve incorporating elements such as prayer spaces, halal food options, and gender-segregated facilities.
4. Foster interfaith dialogue: Encourage dialogue and collaboration between Muslims and non-Muslims to promote mutual understanding and respect. This can help break down stereotypes and build bridges between different cultural groups.
5. Provide education and skills training: Offer educational programs or workshops that teach valuable skills such as computer literacy, entrepreneurship, and leadership. These programs can help empower individuals within the community and promote economic development.
6. Promote cultural expression: Encourage the devout Muslim community to express themselves through various forms of art, music, and dance. This can help preserve their cultural heritage and provide a platform for creative expression.
7. Support local businesses: Encourage the use of local businesses and entrepreneurs within the devout Muslim community. This can help promote economic growth and development while also supporting the community's values and beliefs.
8. Create a safe and inclusive space: Provide a safe and welcoming space for the devout Muslim community to gather, socialize, and participate in cultural activities. This can help foster a sense of belonging and inclusivity within the community.
9. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be aware of cultural sensitivities and avoid any programs or activities that may be perceived as disrespectful or insensitive to the devout Muslim community
