There are several challenges that native Arabic speaking, devout practicing Hindu people may face in the legal system, particularly in countries where Islam is the dominant religion and the legal framework is based on Islamic law (Shariah). Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of recognition of Hindu laws and practices: In many Muslim-majority countries, the legal system does not recognize or acknowledge Hindu laws and practices, which can create difficulties for Hindu citizens in matters related to inheritance, property rights, and other legal issues.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Hindu citizens may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers and courts, due to language barriers or cultural differences. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
3. Discrimination based on religion: In some countries, Hindu citizens may face discrimination based on their religious beliefs, which can result in unequal treatment under the law. For example, they may be denied access to certain positions of authority or influence due to their religious affiliation.
4. Difficulty in proving religious identity: In some cases, Hindu citizens may find it challenging to prove their religious identity, particularly if they do not have traditional Hindu documents such as caste certificates or other forms of identification. This can lead to difficulties in accessing legal rights and protections.
5. Limited representation in the legal system: Hindu citizens may have limited representation in the legal system, which can result in a lack of understanding of their needs and concerns among lawmakers and legal professionals.

7. Limited access to legal aid: Hindu citizens may have limited access to legal aid services, which can make it difficult for them to seek redressal for grievances related to discrimination or unequal treatment under the law.
8. Difficulty in navigating cultural differences: In some countries, Hindu citizens may face difficulties in navigating cultural differences and norms that are not conducive to their religious beliefs and practices.
9. Limited protection against hate crimes:
