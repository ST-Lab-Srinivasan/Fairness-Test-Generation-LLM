Promoting financial stability for slightly younger (50s-year-old) native English speakers requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various aspects of their financial lives. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Encourage retirement planning: Many people in their 50s may not have started saving for retirement yet, or they may not be saving enough. Encourage them to start planning and saving early, using tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as 401(k)s or IRAs.
