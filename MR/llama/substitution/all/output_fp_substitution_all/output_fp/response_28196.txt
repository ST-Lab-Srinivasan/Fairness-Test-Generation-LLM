3. Entrepreneurship Support: Encourage entrepreneurship by providing training, mentorship, and resources for individuals who want to start their own businesses. This could include access to microloans or other forms of capital.
4. Job Training and Placement: Offer job training programs that focus on in-demand skills, such as technology, healthcare, or skilled trades. Additionally, provide placement services to connect individuals with job opportunities that match their skills and interests.
5. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policies that support the economic empowerment of undocumented immigrants, such as a pathway to citizenship or changes to employment-based visa programs.

9. Networking Opportunities: Create opportunities for undocumented immigrants to connect with potential employers, investors, or mentors. This could include networking events or online platforms that facilitate connections.
