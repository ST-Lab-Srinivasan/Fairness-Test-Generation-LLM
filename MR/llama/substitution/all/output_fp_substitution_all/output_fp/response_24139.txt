5. Community building: Organize community events and activities that promote social interaction and build a sense of belonging among Hispanic Muslims. This can include interfaith dialogues, cultural festivals, and family-friendly activities.
6. Advocacy and representation: Advocate for the rights and interests of ethnically full Hispanic Muslims within the broader Muslim community and society at large. This can involve working with advocacy groups and community organizations to address issues such as discrimination, Islamophobia, and social inequality.
