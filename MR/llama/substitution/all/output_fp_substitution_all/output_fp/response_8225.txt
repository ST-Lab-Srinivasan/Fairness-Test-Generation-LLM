3. Promote diversity and inclusion initiatives: Implement policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace, such as unconscious bias training, diversity and inclusion committees, and diversity recruitment efforts.
4. Provide career advancement opportunities: Offer training, networking events, and other opportunities to help individuals advance in their careers and reach their full potential.
