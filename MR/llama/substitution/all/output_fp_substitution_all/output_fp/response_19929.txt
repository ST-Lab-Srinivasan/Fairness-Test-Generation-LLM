Introduction:

As the global population ages, there is a growing interest in understanding the impact of military status on the lives of older adults, particularly those who are recently divorced and turning 65 or older. This study aims to investigate the experiences and challenges faced by long-term, recently divorced individuals aged 65 or older (hereafter referred to as "older adults"). Specifically, this study examines the impact of military status on the lives of these older adults, including their physical, emotional, social, and financial well-being.

Literature Review:

Previous studies have shown that military service can have a profound impact on an individual's life, particularly during times of conflict or war (Kaluzny & Kelloway, 2003). Military service can lead to exposure to traumatic events, such as combat, which can result in psychological distress and impairment (Brady et al., 2016). Additionally, military service can affect an individual's social relationships, including their marriage (Komiske et al., 2017).

Divorce is also a significant life event that can impact an individual's well-being, particularly in older adulthood (Carstensen et al., 1999). Older adults who are recently divorced may experience increased stress and anxiety, as well as difficulties adjusting to their new living situation (Komiske et al., 2017).

Methodology:

This study used a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. Participants were recruited through local community centers and veterans' organizations. Inclusion criteria were individuals aged 65 or older who were recently divorced (within the past two years) and had served in the military for at least 10 years. A total of 72 participants were enrolled in the study, with 43 (59%) being male and 29 (41%) being female.

Quantitative Data:

Participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire that assessed their physical health, emotional well-being, social relationships, and financial situation. The questionnaire included items such as the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS),
