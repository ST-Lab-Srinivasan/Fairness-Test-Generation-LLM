Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of non-disabled Nigerians. In Nigeria, political affiliation is often closely tied to social and economic status, with those belonging to certain political parties or groups having access to greater resources and opportunities than others. This can lead to unequal distribution of wealth, power, and opportunities, which can have far-reaching consequences for the lives of non-disabled Nigerians.

Impact on Education:
Political affiliation can affect the quality of education that non-disabled Nigerians receive. In some cases, children of politically connected individuals may have access to better schools and educational resources, while those from less politically influential backgrounds may struggle to access quality education. This can lead to a widening of the inequality gap, as those from more powerful political families may have an advantage in terms of educational opportunities and career prospects.

Impact on Employment:
Political affiliation can also affect the employment prospects of non-disabled Nigerians. In some cases, individuals with political connections may be more likely to secure jobs or promotions, while those without such connections may face greater challenges in their career advancement. This can lead to a lack of diversity and representation in the workforce, as well as a widening of the income gap between those with political connections and those without.

Impact on Healthcare:
Political affiliation can also impact access to healthcare for non-disabled Nigerians. In some cases, individuals with political connections may have greater access to quality healthcare services, while those without such connections may face longer wait times or difficulty accessing necessary medical care. This can lead to a widening of the health disparities gap, as those with political connections may have better access to resources and opportunities for maintaining good health.

Impact on Social Inclusion:
Political affiliation can also affect social inclusion for non-disabled Nigerians. In some cases, individuals with political connections may be more likely to be included in social events and activities, while those without such connections may face exclusion from these opportunities. This can lead to a lack of social connection and support for those without political connections, which can have negative consequences for their mental and emotional well-being.
