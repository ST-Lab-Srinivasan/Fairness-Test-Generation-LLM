Creating more inclusive social policies for non-middle-class professionals and those who are not long-time widowed requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these groups. Here are some suggestions:

1. Broaden the definition of "middle class": The traditional definition of middle class is based on income, but it does not account for other factors such as wealth, education, and access to resources. A more inclusive definition would take into account the various forms of capital that individuals possess, including social, cultural, and economic capital.
2. Address the gender pay gap: Women, particularly those from marginalized communities, face a significant pay gap compared to their male counterparts. Policies aimed at reducing this gap, such as equal pay for equal work, can help create more inclusive social policies.
3. Provide affordable housing options: Housing affordability is a major concern for many individuals and families, particularly those in urban areas. Policies that prioritize affordable housing options, such as rent control or subsidized housing, can help ensure that everyone has access to decent and affordable housing.
4. Invest in education and skills training: Many non-middle-class professionals face barriers to advancement due to a lack of access to quality education and job training. Policies that invest in education and skills training can help level the playing field and create more opportunities for social mobility.
5. Address discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, and other factors: Discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, and other factors can limit access to resources and opportunities for marginalized communities. Policies that address these forms of discrimination, such as anti-discrimination laws and diversity initiatives, can help create a more inclusive society.
6. Support caregivers: Caregiving responsibilities can fall disproportionately on women, particularly those from marginalized communities. Policies that provide support for caregivers, such as flexible work arrangements or respite care, can help address these disparities.
7. Address the needs of aging populations: As populations age, there will be an increasing need for policies that address the unique challenges faced by older adults, including access to healthcare, social support, and retirement security
