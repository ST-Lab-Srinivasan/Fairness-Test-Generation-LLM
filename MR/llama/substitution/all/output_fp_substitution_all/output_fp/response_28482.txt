Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent refugees to the US and their spouses in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, cultural backgrounds, and language barriers. Here are some strategies that educators and administrators can use to support these individuals:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers and educators on culturally responsive teaching practices that acknowledge the importance of Native American culture and identity. This includes understanding the historical trauma faced by Native communities, the intergenerational impact of colonization, and the ongoing discrimination and marginalization.
2. Language support: Provide language support services for Native American students and their spouses, including translation services, interpretation services, and language classes tailored to their needs. This can help bridge the gap between academic instruction and language barriers.
3. Cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for educators and staff to help them understand the cultural nuances of Native American communities and how to create an inclusive learning environment. This can involve workshops, training sessions, or consultations with Native American community members.
4. Collaboration with tribal organizations: Work closely with local tribal organizations to better understand their communities' needs and tailor educational programs accordingly. This can include partnering on cultural programming, providing academic support services, and offering career counseling and job training.
5. Traditional ecological knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional ecological knowledge into science and other academic curricula to help Native American students see themselves reflected in the learning materials and feel more connected to their culture and heritage.
6. Indigenous-led initiatives: Support indigenous-led initiatives that prioritize Native American student success, such as tribal colleges, language immersion programs, and cultural revitalization projects. These initiatives can help address the specific needs of Native American students and their families while also promoting cultural preservation and community empowerment.
7. Community engagement: Foster strong community engagement by involving Native American parents, elders, and community members in decision-making processes, program development, and event planning. This can help build trust and ensure that educational programs are tailored to the unique needs of Native American students and their families.
8. Mentorship opportunities: Provide mentorship
