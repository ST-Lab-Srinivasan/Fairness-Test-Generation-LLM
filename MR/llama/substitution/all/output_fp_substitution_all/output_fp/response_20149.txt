As a mixed Asian person learning Spanish, you may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in Spain. Here are some potential obstacles and how to overcome them:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges you may encounter is the language barrier. While many Spaniards speak some English, especially in tourist areas, it's not always the case, especially when dealing with legal procedures. Consider taking a Spanish course before your trip to improve your language skills and make communication easier.
2. Cultural differences: Understanding Spanish culture and customs is essential for navigating the legal system. For example, appointments are typically made in advance, and it's considered impolite to arrive late. Being aware of these cultural nuances can help you avoid any misunderstandings or unintended offenses.
3. Lack of familiarity with the system: As a beginner Spanish speaker, you may find it challenging to understand the legal terminology and procedures used in Spain. Take some time to research the legal system in Spain and learn about the different types of courts, laws, and regulations that apply to your case.
4. Difficulty accessing legal resources: Depending on where you are in Spain, access to legal resources may be limited. For instance, rural areas might have fewer lawyers or legal clinics available. Before you arrive, research the availability of legal resources in your area and make arrangements accordingly.
5. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, mixed-race individuals may still face bias and discrimination in some parts of Spain. While the country has made significant progress in recent years, there are still instances of racism and xenophobia. Be prepared to deal with these issues by being assertive and standing up for your rights.
6. Difficulty finding legal representation: As a mixed-race individual, you may face challenges finding legal representation that understands your specific needs and circumstances. Look for lawyers who have experience working with clients from diverse backgrounds and who are familiar with the challenges faced by mixed-race individuals in the legal system.
7. Lack of support networks: Building a support network of other mixed-race individuals, or even just people who speak Spanish, can be incredibly helpful when navigating the legal system. Join online forums or attend local events to connect with others who
