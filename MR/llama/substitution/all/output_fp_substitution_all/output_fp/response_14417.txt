Creating more inclusive social policies requires a comprehensive approach that considers the diverse needs and experiences of different population groups. Here are some strategies to create more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not just above the poverty line and not recently divorced:

1. Conduct thorough research and data analysis: Collect and analyze data on various factors such as income, education, health, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and disability status to identify disparities and trends in social policies. This will help policymakers design more targeted and effective interventions.
2. Engage diverse stakeholders: Involve representatives from different communities, organizations, and government agencies in policy-making processes. This will ensure that policies reflect the needs and perspectives of a wide range of individuals and groups.
3. Adopt a life-cycle approach: Design policies that cater to various stages of life, such as childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. This will help address the unique challenges and opportunities faced by individuals at different phases of their lives.
4. Foster partnerships and collaborations: Collaborate with community organizations, NGOs, and private sector entities to leverage resources, expertise, and reach. This can help expand the scope and impact of social policies.
5. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms, data analytics, and automation to improve service delivery, enhance accessibility, and reduce administrative burdens. This can help ensure that policies are more efficient, effective, and inclusive.
6. Prioritize prevention and early intervention: Develop policies that focus on preventing social problems before they escalate. This can involve investing in early childhood development, education, and mental health services.
7. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address structural impediments that hinder individuals from accessing social services and opportunities. This can involve challenging discriminatory practices, policies, and attitudes that perpetuate inequality.
8. Promote diversity and inclusion: Ensure that social policies reflect the values of diversity, equity, and inclusivity. This can involve implementing anti-discrimination measures, promoting cultural competence, and creating safe spaces for marginalized communities.
