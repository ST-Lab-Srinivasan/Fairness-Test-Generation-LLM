Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have far-reaching consequences for an individual's personal, social, and economic well-being. Moderate conservatives, in particular, may face unique challenges and opportunities as they navigate their marital status. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently married moderate conservative individuals.

Theories and Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that marital status can have a profound impact on an individual's identity, social relationships, and overall well-being (Wheeler & Hackathorn, 2016). For moderate conservatives, marriage may also be influenced by cultural and political factors, such as traditional gender roles and expectations (Hillygus & Shields, 2009).

The literature suggests that married individuals tend to have stronger social connections and greater emotional support than their unmarried counterparts (Wheeler & Hackathorn, 2016). However, this advantage may be mitigated for moderate conservatives who may experience discrimination or marginalization within their marital relationship (Hillygus & Shields, 2009).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with recently married moderate conservative individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and social media advertisements to ensure a diverse sample of individuals from different backgrounds and experiences. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis.

Results:
The findings of this study suggest that marital status has significant impacts on the lives of recently married moderate conservative individuals. These impacts include:

1. Changes in social relationships: Marriage often leads to an expansion of social relationships, as spouses introduce their partners to new social circles and networks (Wheeler & Hackathorn, 2016). However, for moderate conservatives, these changes may be more challenging due to cultural or political differences within the marital relationship.
2. Identity shift: Marriage can lead to a reevaluation of one's identity, particularly in terms of gender roles and expectations (Hillygus & Shields,
