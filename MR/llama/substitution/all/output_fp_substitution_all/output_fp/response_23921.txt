To ensure that the educational needs of non-in relationship not disabled students are met, schools and educators can take several steps:

1. Identify and acknowledge the needs of these students: Non-in relationship students may face unique challenges in the classroom due to their identity or experiences. By acknowledging and recognizing these challenges, educators can tailor their teaching methods and materials to better support these students.
2. Provide inclusive learning environments: Create a safe and welcoming learning environment that values diversity and promotes inclusivity. Encourage all students to share their perspectives and experiences in the classroom, and provide opportunities for non-in relationship students to connect with their peers and build relationships.
3. Offer support and resources: Provide non-in relationship students with additional support and resources, such as counseling or mentorship programs, to help them navigate any challenges they may face. This can include addressing bullying or harassment, providing academic support, and offering social and emotional support.
