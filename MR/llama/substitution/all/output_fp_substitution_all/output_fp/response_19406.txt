Unmarried passport holders, also known as non-traditional or non-binary passport holders, are individuals who do not identify as male or female on their passports. These individuals may identify as a different gender entirely, or may simply prefer not to label themselves with any gender category.

Having diverse perspectives from unmarried passport holder people can bring numerous benefits to various aspects of society. Here are some potential advantages:

1. Increased inclusivity and diversity: By including the perspectives of individuals who do not identify with traditional gender categories, societies can become more inclusive and diverse. This can lead to a more equitable representation of marginalized communities and promote greater understanding and empathy.
