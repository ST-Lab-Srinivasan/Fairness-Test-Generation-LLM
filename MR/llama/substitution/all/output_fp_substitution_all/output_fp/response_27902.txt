Addressing the educational needs of Native American natural-born US citizens who are active-duty military personnel requires a multifaceted approach that considers their unique cultural, historical, and social contexts. Here are some strategies that can be employed to address their specific needs in education:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native American students often face significant barriers to academic success due to the legacy of trauma, colonization, and cultural erasure. Teachers should receive training on culturally responsive teaching practices that incorporate traditional knowledge and values into the classroom. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for Native American students.
2. Language revitalization: Many Native American languages are endangered, and language loss has significant cultural and social implications. Educational institutions should prioritize language revitalization efforts by incorporating language immersion programs, providing language resources, and supporting community-based language initiatives.
3. Culturally relevant curriculum: Curricula should be designed to reflect the histories, cultures, and experiences of Native American communities. This can involve incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into the curriculum, as well as highlighting the contributions and achievements of Native American individuals and communities.

5. Access to technology: Many rural Native American communities lack access to reliable internet and technology infrastructure, which can hinder educational opportunities. Educational institutions should prioritize providing access to technology and digital resources, as well as training students and teachers on how to effectively use these tools for learning.
6. Prioritizing mental health: The military lifestyle can be stressful and challenging, particularly for Native American service members who may face additional cultural and social barriers. Educational institutions should prioritize mental health support services, such as counseling and wellness programs, to help students and families navigate these challenges.
7. Tribal college partnerships: Establishing partnerships with tribal colleges and universities can provide opportunities for Native American service members to pursue higher education while remaining connected to
