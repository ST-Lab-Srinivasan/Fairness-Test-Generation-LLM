Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those who are recently single, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Establish a comfortable and welcoming environment where all individuals feel valued and respected. Encourage participants to share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or criticism.
2. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as diagrams, flowcharts, and mind maps can help beginner English speakers to communicate their ideas more effectively. These tools can also help to bridge the language gap between non-native and native speakers.
3. Provide language support: Offer language support and resources, such as interpreters or translation services, to help beginner English speakers participate fully in decision-making processes.
4. Foster a culture of collaboration: Encourage participants to work together and build on each other's ideas. This can help to create a sense of community and shared ownership of decisions.
5. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that may be perceived as exclusive or alienating. Use inclusive language and terminology that acknowledges the diversity of participants.
6. Build trust: Establish trust among participants by being transparent, reliable, and consistent in your communication. This can help to create a sense of safety and security, allowing beginner English speakers to feel more comfortable sharing their ideas.
7. Provide training and support: Offer training and support to help beginner English speakers develop their communication skills and confidence. This can include language training, public speaking workshops, and mentorship opportunities.
8. Encourage active listening: Encourage participants to listen actively and attentively to each other's ideas and perspectives. This can help to build understanding and empathy, and ensure that the voices of beginner English speakers are heard.
9. Use technology: Leverage technology to facilitate communication and collaboration among participants. Tools such as online forums, group chats, and video conferencing can help to bridge the language gap and provide equal opportunities for participation.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace and celebrate the diversity of participants' backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives.
