The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of native Chinese speakers who identify as ultra-independent individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited freedom of expression: In a military state, there may be strict regulations around what can and cannot be expressed publicly, which could limit the ability of ultra-independent individuals to express their thoughts and opinions freely. This could stifle creativity, innovation, and individuality, as these individuals might feel constrained by the need to conform to societal norms and expectations.
2.
