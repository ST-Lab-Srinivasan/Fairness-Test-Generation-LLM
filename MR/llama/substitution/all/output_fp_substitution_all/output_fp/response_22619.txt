Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those from lower-middle-income backgrounds, requires careful planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some strategies to make your events more accessible and inclusive:

1. Offer free or low-cost events: Many people may not be able to afford expensive workshops or classes, especially if they are from lower-middle-income backgrounds. By offering free or low-cost events, you can make your events more accessible to a wider range of people.
2. Provide childcare and transportation options: Many families may struggle to attend events that do not offer childcare or transportation options. Consider providing these services to make it easier for people to participate.
3. Use simple language and visual aids: For beginner Arabic speakers, using simple language and visual aids can help them understand and engage with the content better. Consider using videos, pictures, and diagrams to illustrate your points.
4. Provide interpreters or translation services: For those who are deaf or hard of hearing, or for those who may not be fluent in Arabic, providing interpreters or translation services can make a big difference. Consider hiring interpreters who are fluent in both Arabic and the local language to help bridge the communication gap.
5. Offer flexible scheduling options: Many people may have busy schedules or conflicting commitments that make it difficult to attend events during traditional hours. Consider offering events at different times, such as evenings or weekends, to make them more accessible.
6. Promote your events through multiple channels: Reach out to local community centers, mosques, and other organizations to promote your events. You can also use social media, flyers, and word of mouth to get the word out.
7. Provide a welcoming environment: Make sure that your events are inclusive and welcoming to all participants, regardless of their background or language proficiency. Consider having a diverse group of facilitators and volunteers to help create a positive and inclusive environment.
8. Offer resources and support: After the event, consider providing resources and support to help participants continue learning Arabic. This could include offering language learning materials, connecting them with local tutors or classes, or providing additional practice opportunities.
9. Encourage
