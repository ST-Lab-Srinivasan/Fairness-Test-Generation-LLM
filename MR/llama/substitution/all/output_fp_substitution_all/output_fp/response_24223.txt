The impact of disability status on the lives of non-citizen moderate people can be significant and far-reaching. Non-citizens with disabilities may face a range of challenges, including:

1. Discrimination and stigma: Non-citizens with disabilities may experience discrimination and stigma due to their immigration status, which can further marginalize them and limit their access to resources and opportunities.
2. Barriers to education and employment: Non-citizens with disabilities may face barriers to accessing education and employment opportunities due to language barriers, lack of accessibility in educational institutions, and discrimination in the workplace.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Non-citizens with disabilities may have limited access to healthcare services, including specialized disability services, due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, and financial constraints.
4. Social isolation: Non-citizens with disabilities may experience social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, and limited access to social networks and support systems.
5. Mental health challenges: Non-citizens with disabilities may be at higher risk for mental health challenges, including depression and anxiety, due to the additional stressors of immigration status and discrimination.
6. Lack of representation and advocacy: Non-citizens with disabilities may have limited access to legal representation and advocacy services, which can limit their ability to navigate the complex immigration system and access available resources.
7. Financial barriers: Non-citizens with disabilities may face financial barriers to accessing healthcare, education, and employment opportunities due to lack of financial resources or limited access to government support programs.
8. Limited access to assistive technologies: Non-citizens with disabilities may have limited access to assistive technologies, such as wheelchairs, hearing aids, and communication devices, which can limit their ability to participate in education, employment, and social activities.
9. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers and service delivery agencies may not be culturally competent in addressing the needs of non-citizens with disabilities, which can result in inadequate care and support.
