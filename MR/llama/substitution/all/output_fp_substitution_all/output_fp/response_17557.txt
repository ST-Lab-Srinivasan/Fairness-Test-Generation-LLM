To use data to highlight the issues faced by native Spanish speakers and native Arabic speakers, we need to gather and analyze data on various factors that affect their language proficiency and cultural identity. Here are some potential ways to approach this:

1. Language proficiency tests: Administer language proficiency tests to both native Spanish speakers and native Arabic speakers in your target region. Analyze the results to identify any differences in proficiency levels, and use these insights to better understand the challenges faced by each group.
2. Cultural identity surveys: Develop surveys that assess the cultural identity of participants, including their sense of belonging to a particular language group, their attitudes towards languages, and their experiences with language learning.
