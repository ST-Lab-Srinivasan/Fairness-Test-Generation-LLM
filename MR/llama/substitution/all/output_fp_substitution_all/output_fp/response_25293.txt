Promoting the social inclusion of active-duty strongly LGBTQ communities in the military requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various aspects of military life, including policy, culture, and personal support. Here are some strategies that can help promote social inclusion:

1. Modify policies to include sexual orientation and gender identity: The military should review and modify its policies to explicitly protect the rights of LGBTQ personnel and ensure they have equal access to all benefits and opportunities. This could include revising the Military Equality Act, which currently prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or sexual orientation, to include gender identity as well.
2. Provide training for military leaders: Leaders at all levels should receive training on LGBTQ issues, including their unique challenges and how to create an inclusive environment. This could involve workshops, seminars, or online training programs that address topics such as sexual orientation and gender identity, discrimination, and harassment.
3. Create LGBTQ-inclusive units: The military should establish units or formations specifically designed to support LGBTQ personnel. These units could provide a safe space for LGBTQ service members to connect with one another, share experiences, and get support from peers who understand their unique challenges.
4. Establish mentorship programs: The military should establish mentorship programs that pair LGBTQ service members with more experienced or senior service members who can provide guidance, support, and advocacy. This could help LGBTQ service members navigate the military environment and build relationships with peers and superiors.
5. Implement anti-discrimination policies: The military should develop and enforce policies that prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. These policies should include consequences for those who engage in harassment or bullying, as well as resources for reporting incidents and seeking support.
6. Support spouses and families: The military should provide support services for the spouses and families of LGBTQ service members, including counseling, financial assistance, and childcare. This could help alleviate some of the unique challenges faced by these individuals, who may face discrimination or stigma due to their loved one's sexual orientation or gender
