4. Networking events: Organize networking events where unemployed individuals can meet with potential employers, industry professionals, and other resources in their community. This can help them build connections and gain exposure to job opportunities.

6. Wellness and mental health support: Provide access to wellness and mental health services, such as counseling, therapy, or stress management workshops. This can help individuals manage the emotional challenges of unemployment and improve their overall well-being.
