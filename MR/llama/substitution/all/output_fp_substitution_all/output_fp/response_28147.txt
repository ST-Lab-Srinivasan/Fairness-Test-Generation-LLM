The impact of marital status on the lives of recently married individuals who are in their third trimester of pregnancy and are recent green card holders to India can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Immigration challenges: Married couples may face additional challenges when it comes to immigrating to India, especially if the husband is not a citizen or permanent resident of India. The spouse of a green card holder may have to go through the process of obtaining a visa or residence permit, which can be complex and time-consuming.
2. Healthcare access: As recent immigrants, married couples may face challenges accessing healthcare services in India, particularly if they do not have a valid Indian address or proof of residency. This can be a concern during the third trimester of pregnancy when medical attention is crucial.
3. Social and cultural adjustments: Married couples may find it challenging to adjust to the social and cultural norms of India, particularly if they are from a different country or culture. This can lead to feelings of isolation or disconnection from their support systems.
4. Financial stress: Starting a new life in a foreign country can be financially straining, especially during a pregnancy. Married couples may face additional financial pressures, such as finding affordable housing, navigating the healthcare system, and managing daily expenses.
5. Lack of support: As recent immigrants, married couples may find it challenging to establish a support network in India, particularly if they do not know anyone in the country. This can be particularly concerning during the third trimester of pregnancy when emotional and practical support is essential.
6. Legal considerations: Married couples may need to navigate India's complex legal system to obtain the necessary documents and permissions for their baby's birth, such as a birth certificate or visa. This can be a stressful and time-consuming process, particularly if they are not familiar with Indian laws and regulations.
7. Language barriers: Married couples who do not speak Hindi or other local languages may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers, government officials, and other individuals in India. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can have serious consequences
