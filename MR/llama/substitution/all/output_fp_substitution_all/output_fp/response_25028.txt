Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative, non-divorced individuals can be achieved by being mindful of their feelings and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the individual's perspective: Take the time to listen to the individual's concerns and perspectives on cultural celebrations. Ask them about their beliefs, values, and traditions to better understand their needs.
2. Be inclusive in planning: Involve the individual in the planning process for cultural celebrations. Encourage them to share their ideas and suggestions, and be open to incorporating their perspectives.
3. Respect their choices: Recognize that not everyone may want to participate in every cultural celebration. Respect the individual's choices and decisions regarding which celebrations they do or don't want to attend.
4. Provide alternative options: Offer alternative ways for individuals who may not feel comfortable participating in certain cultural celebrations. For example, provide vegetarian or vegan options for individuals who follow a specific dietary preference.
5. Be mindful of language and symbols: Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or alienating to non-conservative individuals. Use inclusive language and symbols that represent the diversity of your community.
6. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for individuals to connect with each other and feel included in the cultural celebrations. Encourage mingling and socializing during events, and provide ways for people to get involved and contribute to the celebration.
7. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about different cultures and traditions, and share that knowledge with others. Encourage others to do the same, and create a culture of mutual respect and understanding.
8. Be open to feedback: Be willing to listen to feedback from individuals and make changes accordingly. Show that you value their opinions and are committed to creating inclusive cultural celebrations.
9. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of your community and celebrate the unique perspectives and traditions of each individual. Use this diversity to create a more vibrant and inclusive cultural atmosphere.
10. Be proactive: Don't wait for individuals to speak up about their needs. Take the initiative
