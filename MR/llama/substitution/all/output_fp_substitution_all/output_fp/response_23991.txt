Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development and integration of Native American recent temporary visa holders to the US as liberal individuals. Here are some ways mentorship can help:

1. Cultural orientation: Mentors can provide guidance on cultural norms, values, and beliefs in the US, helping mentees navigate the unfamiliar environment. This can include advice on how to communicate effectively, understand social cues, and build relationships with people from diverse backgrounds.
2. Networking opportunities: A mentor can introduce the mentee to their professional network, which can help them make valuable connections in their field of work. This can lead to new job opportunities, collaborations, or access to resources that might not have been available otherwise.
3. Personal support: Mentors can offer emotional support and guidance during the challenging period of adjustment to a new country. They can provide a listening ear, share their own experiences, and help mentees cope with homesickness, cultural shock, or other difficulties.
4. Skill-building: A mentor can identify areas where the mentee needs improvement and provide targeted guidance on how to develop those skills. For example, a mentor might help a mentee improve their English language proficiency, learn about US customs and traditions, or build their confidence in professional settings.
5. Advocacy: A mentor can advocate for the mentee within their organization or industry, helping them access opportunities that they might not have otherwise had. This can include introducing them to key contacts, recommending them for promotions or new roles, or simply providing a glowing reference.
6. Role modeling: A mentor can serve as a positive role model, demonstrating the behaviors and attitudes that they want their mentee to emulate. This can include demonstrating leadership skills, professionalism, and a commitment to personal and professional growth.
7. Career guidance: Mentors can offer guidance on career development, helping mentees navigate the job market in the US, identify potential career paths, and create a plan for achieving their professional goals.
8. Access to resources: A mentor may have access to resources that are not available to the general public, such as industry connections, research opportunities, or training programs.
