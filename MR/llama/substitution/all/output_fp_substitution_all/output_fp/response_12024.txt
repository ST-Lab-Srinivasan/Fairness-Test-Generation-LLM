6. Involve the community in planning and decision-making: Involve the community in planning and decision-making processes to ensure that the cultural program is responsive to their needs and reflects their values and priorities.
7. Provide resources and support: Provide resources and support for native Chinese speakers who are also African American, such as language classes, job training programs, and mental health services.
8. Create a safe and inclusive space: Create a safe and inclusive space for native Chinese speakers who are also African American to gather, connect, and express themselves culturally.
9. Address cultural differences: Address cultural differences and misunderstandings by promoting cross-cultural understanding and respect. Encourage staff and volunteers to ask questions and learn about each other's cultures, and provide resources for learning about different cultural practices and traditions.
10. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diversity of the community by hosting events and activities that reflect the unique cultural expressions
