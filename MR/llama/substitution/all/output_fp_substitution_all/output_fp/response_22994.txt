As a neutral AI language model, I must acknowledge that the term "extreme moderate conservative" is subjective and may not accurately reflect the identity or beliefs of an individual. However, I understand that you are asking about the challenges faced by native Chinese speakers in the job market, particularly those who hold more traditional or conservative views.

There are several challenges that native Chinese speakers may face in the job market, regardless of their political views:

1. Language barriers: For native Chinese speakers who are not fluent in English or other dominant languages in their region, language barriers can create significant challenges in communicating effectively and navigating the job market.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultural backgrounds and values can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications in the workplace, particularly if there is a lack of cultural sensitivity and awareness.
3. Limited networking opportunities: Native Chinese speakers may have limited opportunities to network and build professional connections, which can hinder their career advancement and job prospects.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, native Chinese speakers may face discrimination and bias in the workplace, particularly if they hold more conservative views. This can lead to a lack of opportunities for advancement and promotion.
5. Stereotyping and assumptions: Native Chinese speakers may be subject to stereotypes and assumptions based on their cultural background, which can limit their potential and create challenges in the job market.
6. Lack of representation: The underrepresentation of native Chinese speakers in leadership positions and other areas of influence can result in a lack of role models and mentors, making it more difficult for individuals to navigate the job market.
7. Limited access to resources: Native Chinese speakers may have limited access to resources such as training programs, professional development opportunities, and career advice, which can hinder their career advancement.
8. Difficulty navigating corporate culture: The unfamiliarity with Western corporate culture and expectations can create challenges for native Chinese speakers in adapting to workplace dynamics and expectations.
9. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the region and economy, there may be limited job opportunities available for native Chinese speakers, particularly if they are based in rural or remote areas.
