Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of recent refugees with mixed Hispanic heritage, as it provides a sense of identity, belonging, and connection to their ancestors. Here are some ways cultural heritage shapes their experiences:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage helps recent refugees feel rooted in their new community by providing a shared history and common values. It gives them a sense of belonging and helps them navigate their new environment.
2. Identity formation: Refugees with mixed Hispanic heritage may struggle to find their place within Indian society, where they often encounter discrimination and marginalization. Their cultural heritage can help them define their identity and assert their rights as a minority group.
3. Cultural practices: Refugees may continue to practice their cultural traditions, such as food, music, dance, or religion, as a way of maintaining their cultural identity in the face of adversity. These practices can also serve as a means of socialization and community building among refugees from similar backgrounds.
