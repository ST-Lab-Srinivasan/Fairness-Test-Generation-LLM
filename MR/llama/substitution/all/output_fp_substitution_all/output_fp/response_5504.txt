Title: The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Long-Time Single Beginner French Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who are long-time single beginner French speakers. As they navigate their way through the language learning process, their cultural background and experiences influence their perceptions and attitudes towards the language and its culture. This paper will explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of these individuals and how it impacts their language learning journey.

Theory:
Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are transmitted from one generation to the next within a particular culture or society (Kottak, 2013). It is shaped by historical, social, political, and economic factors that influence how individuals perceive themselves and their place in the world. For long-time single beginner French speakers, cultural heritage can play a crucial role in shaping their identities, particularly if they are from diverse backgrounds.

Identity formation is a complex process that involves the interaction of various factors, including cultural heritage, personal experiences, and social environments (Hall, 1990). As individuals learn a new language, they are exposed to new cultural practices, values, and beliefs that may conflict with their existing identity. This can lead to a re-evaluation of their identity or the formation of a new identity that incorporates both their old and new cultural experiences (Bernal, 2013).

Methodology:
To investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of long-time single beginner French speakers, I conducted interviews with ten participants who had been learning French for at least two years. The sample consisted of individuals from different cultural backgrounds, including African, Asian, European, and Latin American. The interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide to elicit information about the participants' cultural heritage, language learning experiences, and perceptions of their identities.

Results:
The results of the study indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-time single beginner French speakers. The majority of the participants reported that their cultural heritage influenced their language learning journey,
