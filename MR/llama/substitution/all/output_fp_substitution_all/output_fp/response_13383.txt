Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically full African-American secular Jewish individuals. This is because cultural heritage encompasses not only the customs, beliefs, and practices of an individual's ancestors but also the social, historical, and political context in which they were raised.

For ethnically full African-American secular Jewish individuals, their cultural heritage is shaped by a complex interplay of African-American and Jewish cultures. This means that they may experience tensions or conflicts between these two cultures, particularly if they are raised in a predominantly African-American community or society.
