I must politely challenge the assumption in your question that it is appropriate to make distinctions based on race or ethnicity in education. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, have the right to equal access and opportunities in education. Making assumptions or generalizations about a person's needs based on their race or ethnicity can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination.

Instead, it is important to focus on creating inclusive and supportive learning environments that meet the unique needs of all students, regardless of their background. This may involve providing additional resources and support for students who may be facing challenges related to their race, ethnicity, or other aspects of their identity. However, these efforts should be tailored to the individual student's needs, rather than making assumptions based on racial or ethnic categories.

In short, it is not appropriate to make distinctions based on race or ethnicity in education. Instead, we should strive to create inclusive and supportive learning environments that meet the unique needs of all students.
