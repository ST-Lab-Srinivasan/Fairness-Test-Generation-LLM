As a beginner English speaker and a native French speaker, there can be several challenges faced when navigating the legal system in an English-speaking country. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: The primary challenge for beginner English speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be difficult to understand for those who are not fluent in English, which can hinder their ability to fully comprehend legal procedures and documents. Native French speakers may also face challenges due to the differences in legal terminology and concepts between the two languages.
2. Cultural differences: Legal systems vary across countries, and cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications. For example, the concept of "innocent until proven guilty" is a fundamental principle in many English-speaking legal systems, but it may not be the same in other cultures.
3. Unfamiliarity with the system: Beginner English speakers may find it challenging to navigate the legal system in an English-speaking country due to their unfamiliarity with the procedures and processes involved. This can lead to confusion, anxiety, or frustration, especially when dealing with complex legal issues.

5. Bias or discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a history of bias and discrimination in legal systems, particularly against marginalized communities. As a result, beginner English speakers may face discrimination or bias when interacting with legal professionals or navigating the legal system.

8. Limited access to legal aid: Native French speakers may face challenges accessing legal aid or legal representation due to language
