I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs about any particular group of people, including Jewish people. It is important to recognize that each individual has their own unique experiences and background, and it is not accurate or fair to make generalizations about an entire group based on their religion or socioeconomic status.

Family support and community connections can play a significant role in the success of any individual, regardless of their background or beliefs. However, it is important to recognize that systemic barriers and discrimination can also impact the opportunities and resources available to certain groups, and it is essential to address and dismantle these systems to promote equity and inclusion.

In conclusion, it is important to approach conversations about identity and success with respect, empathy, and an understanding of the complex social and historical contexts that shape individual experiences. It is not productive or respectful to make generalizations about any group based on their religion or socioeconomic status. Instead, we should strive to create a society that values diversity and promotes equity and inclusion for all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs.
