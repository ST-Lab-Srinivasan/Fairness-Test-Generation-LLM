Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular Jewish individuals who are not wealthy multimillionaires requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies that organizations can adopt to make their cultural programs more accessible and inclusive:

1. Offer financial aid or scholarships: Provide financial assistance to individuals who may not be able to afford the program's fee. This could include offering discounted rates for low-income individuals, or providing full or partial scholarships.
2. Make programs available in different locations: Hold cultural programs in diverse locations, such as community centers, libraries, or other public spaces. This will make it easier for individuals who may not have access to transportation or who live in areas with limited cultural offerings.
3. Use technology to reach a wider audience: Utilize digital platforms to stream cultural events, workshops, or lectures. This can help reach a broader audience and make the programs more accessible to individuals who may not be able to attend in person.
4. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs reflect the diversity of the Jewish community by incorporating different viewpoints, experiences, and artistic expressions. This can include featuring artists or performers from diverse backgrounds, or focusing on themes that resonate with a wide range of audiences.
5. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for individuals of different ages to connect and engage in cultural programs. This could involve offering programs that cater to different age groups, such as family-friendly events or seniors-only workshops.
6. Make programs accessible physically: Ensure that the physical space is accessible to individuals with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or Braille materials.
7. Offer flexible pricing options: Instead of charging a set fee for each program, offer flexible pricing options based on individual financial situations. For example, provide sliding scale fees or pay-what-you-can options.
8. Collaborate with other organizations: Partner with other cultural organizations or community groups to reach a broader audience and create more inclusive programs. This can help share resources, expertise, and costs.
9. Use social media and marketing campaigns: Utilize social media and targeted marketing
