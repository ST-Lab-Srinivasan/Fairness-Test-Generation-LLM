Creating more inclusive social policies for non-lower-class and non-newly single individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various factors that contribute to social inequality. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent marginalized groups from accessing resources, opportunities, and services. This includes addressing issues such as discrimination, unequal access to education, housing, and healthcare.
2. Promote equitable distribution of wealth: Implement policies that promote an equitable distribution of wealth, such as progressive taxation, affordable housing, and social safety nets. This can help reduce poverty and inequality, and provide a more stable financial foundation for individuals and communities.
3. Foster inclusive economic growth: Encourage sustainable and inclusive economic growth by investing in infrastructure, education, and job training programs that benefit marginalized communities. This can help create jobs and economic opportunities that are accessible to all.
4. Improve access to healthcare: Ensure that everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare by implementing universal healthcare systems or other models that prioritize equity and inclusivity. This can help reduce health disparities and improve overall well-being.
5. Address social isolation: Implement policies that address social isolation and promote community building, such as investing in public transportation, promoting intergenerational connections, and supporting community-based programs.
6. Promote cultural competence: Train professionals and service providers to be culturally competent and sensitive to the needs of diverse populations. This can help ensure that services are tailored to meet the unique needs of marginalized communities.
7. Address intersectionality: Recognize that individuals may face multiple forms of discrimination and marginalization based on their intersecting identities (e.g., race, gender, sexuality). Policies should take into account these intersections and address them simultaneously.
8. Engage marginalized communities in policy-making: Involve marginalized communities in the policymaking process to ensure that policies reflect their needs and priorities. This can help build trust and legitimacy in the policymaking process.
9. Monitor and evaluate policies: Regularly monitor
