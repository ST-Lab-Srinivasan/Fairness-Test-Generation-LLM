To highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers and native Arabic speakers, you can use data in several ways:

1. Survey Research: Conduct surveys among beginner English speakers and native Arabic speakers to gather data on their language learning experiences, challenges, and successes. You can use online survey tools like Google Forms or SurveyMonkey to collect responses anonymously.
2. Language Proficiency Testing: Administer language proficiency tests to both groups of learners and analyze the results to identify areas where beginner English speakers struggle more than native Arabic speakers. For example, you can use standardized tests like TOEFL or IELTS to assess language proficiency.
3. Corpus Analysis: Analyze large datasets of written texts (e.g., online forums, social media posts, news articles) to identify common language errors and phrases that are more frequent in beginner English speakers than native Arabic speakers. For example, you can use the COCA corpus (Corpus of Contemporary American English) or the BNC (British National Corpus) to analyze language use in these groups.
4. User-Generated Content Analysis: Analyze user-generated content (e.g., social media posts, blogs, comments) to identify common language mistakes and areas where beginner English speakers may need more support. For example, you can use the Twitter API or Google's Cloud Natural Language API to analyze large amounts of text data.
5. Interviews: Conduct interviews with both groups of learners to gather qualitative data on their language learning experiences, challenges, and strategies. You can use audio or video recording tools like Zoom or Skype to conduct remote interviews.
6. Observational Studies: Observe beginner English speakers and native Arabic speakers in language learning settings (e.g., language classes, language exchange events) to gather data on their language use and interactions with others. You can use video recording tools like ScreenFlow or OBS Studio to capture footage of these observations.
7. Language Learning App Analytics: Analyze data from language learning apps (e.g., Duolingo, Babbel, Rosetta Stone) to identify patterns in language learning behaviors and outcomes among beginner English speakers and native Arabic speakers. For example
