Creating more inclusive community events for Mandarin-speaking lower-middle-income people requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the audience: Conduct research to gain a deeper understanding of the needs, preferences, and cultural backgrounds of the target audience. This will help you tailor your events to their interests and make them feel more included.
2. Offer language support: Provide interpreters or translators during events to ensure that everyone can participate and understand the content. This can be especially important for those who may not speak English fluently.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming atmosphere where everyone feels valued and included. Encourage participation from all attendees, including those who may be shy or hesitant to speak up.
4. Provide accessible amenities: Ensure that your event space is wheelchair-accessible and has amenities such as gender-neutral bathrooms, water fountains, and comfortable seating.
5. Offer childcare and family-friendly activities: Recognize that lower-middle-income individuals may have additional responsibilities such as caring for children or elderly relatives. Provide childcare services or organize family-friendly activities to ensure everyone can participate.
6. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with community groups, schools, and other organizations that serve Mandarin-speaking populations. This can help amplify your reach and create a more inclusive event.
7. Promote events through multiple channels: Advertise your events through various channels such as social media, flyers, posters, and word of mouth to ensure that the message reaches a diverse audience.
8. Focus on cultural programming: Incorporate cultural elements such as music, dance, and traditional foods from Mandarin-speaking regions into your events. This can help attendees feel more connected to the community and the event.
9. Offer financial assistance: Consider offering financial assistance or scholarships to lower-middle-income individuals who may face barriers to attending events due to financial constraints.
10. Solicit feedback: Collect feedback from attendees after events to identify areas for improvement and ensure that the needs of your target audience are being met.
