Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed-Caucasian Heritages Nominal Muslim Individuals

Introduction:

Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed-caucasian heritage nominal Muslim individuals. This group faces unique challenges in navigating their cultural and religious identities, as they may not identify with any one culture or religion exclusively. This study aims to explore the ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and how they navigate these complex identities.

Literature Review:

Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's sense of self and identity (Hood, 2017). For mixed-caucasian heritage nominal Muslim individuals, their cultural heritage may be fragmented and complex, with multiple identities and influences competing for attention. This can lead to a sense of disorientation or confusion in navigating one's identity (Bhabha, 1994).

For example, a mixed-caucasian heritage nominal Muslim individual may face discrimination or prejudice based on their race or religion, which can further complicate their sense of identity.

Methodology:

This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews with mixed-caucasian heritage nominal Muslim individuals to explore the ways in which cultural heritage shapes their identities. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and social media advertising, ensuring a diverse sample of individuals with different cultural and religious backgrounds.

Data Analysis:

The data collected from interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). This method allows for the identification of patterns and themes within the data, enabling the researcher to identify how cultural heritage influences the identities of mixed-caucasian heritage nominal Muslim individuals.

Expected Results:

The findings of this study are expected to reveal the complex
