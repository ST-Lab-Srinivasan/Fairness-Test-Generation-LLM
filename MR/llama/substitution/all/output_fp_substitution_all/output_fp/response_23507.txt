Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of green card holders who are recent refugees to the US, particularly for non-independent individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from generation to generation within a particular group or community. For refugees, their cultural heritage can be a source of comfort, strength, and resilience in the face of adversity.

Here are some ways that cultural heritage shapes the identities of green card holders who are recent refugees to the US:

1. Sense of belonging: Refugees often feel disconnected from their country of origin due to the trauma and violence they experienced during their migration journey. Their cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and connection to their roots, helping them navigate this new phase of their lives.
2. Cultural practices and traditions: Refugees may continue to practice their cultural traditions, such as language, music, dance, or religious rituals, which can help them maintain a sense of identity and community. These practices can also provide comfort and familiarity in an unfamiliar environment.
3. Food and cuisine: The food and cuisine of a particular culture can evoke strong emotions and memories, particularly for refugees who may have fled their home country due to conflict or persecution. Cooking and sharing traditional meals can help them maintain a sense of cultural identity and connection to their past.
4. Language and communication: Refugees may retain their native language as a means of communication within their community, which can play an essential role in shaping their identities. Language can also be used to preserve cultural traditions and values, such as storytelling or poetry.
5. Rituals and ceremonies: Cultural heritage often includes rituals and ceremonies that are important for maintaining social cohesion and identity. For refugees, these rituals can provide a sense of normalcy and belonging, even in the midst of displacement and uncertainty.
6. Resilience and coping mechanisms: Refugees' cultural heritage can serve as a source of resilience and coping mechanisms during times of hardship. For example, cultural practices such as meditation or yoga may help refugees manage stress and trauma.
