Addressing the specific needs of non-long-time single devout Muslim individuals in education requires a nuanced approach that takes into account their unique experiences, challenges, and goals. Here are some strategies that educators and administrators can consider:

1. Cultural sensitivity training for teachers: Provide cultural sensitivity training for teachers to help them understand the beliefs, practices, and values of Muslim students. This can include learning about Islamic holidays, customs, and traditions, as well as how to interact with students who may have different cultural backgrounds.
2. Inclusive classroom environment: Create an inclusive classroom environment that encourages diversity and respect for all cultures and beliefs. Encourage students to share their experiences and perspectives, and provide opportunities for them to discuss their beliefs and practices in a safe and supportive setting.
3. Accommodations for prayer: Make arrangements for Muslim students to perform their daily prayers during school hours. This can include providing a designated prayer space or allowing students to pray in their classrooms during breaks.
4. Educating about Islam: Offer educational resources that provide accurate and balanced information about Islam, such as books, articles, and videos. Encourage students to ask questions and engage in respectful dialogue about the religion.
5. Support for Ramadan: During the month of Ramadan, offer additional support to Muslim students who may be fasting during school hours. This can include providing water and snacks, allowing them to eat and drink discreetly during class time, and being understanding of their fatigue and focus during this period.
6. Addressing bullying and discrimination: Take steps to address any instances of bullying or discrimination against Muslim students based on their religion or cultural background. Encourage a culture of inclusivity and respect in the school community.
7. Building relationships with Muslim students: Take the time to get to know individual Muslim students and build relationships with them. Show an interest in their beliefs, practices, and experiences, and provide support and guidance when needed.
8. Providing halal food options: Offer halal food options in the school cafeteria or at special events, such as iftar during Ramadan. This can help Muslim students feel included and supported during these important times.
