Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Asexual Identities in Strongly Soft Republican Contexts

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who identify as asexual. In strongly soft Republican contexts, where social and political values are centered around inclusivity and diversity, the role of cultural heritage in shaping asexual identities is particularly relevant. This paper aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the formation and expression of asexual identities in these contexts.

Theories of Cultural Heritage:
Cultural heritage refers to the collective memories, traditions, and beliefs of a particular group or society. It is composed of intangible elements such as language, religion, customs, and practices, as well as tangible artifacts and monuments. In strongly soft Republican contexts, cultural heritage can play a crucial role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who identify as asexual.

In strongly soft Republican contexts, asexual identities are recognized and respected, providing individuals with the freedom to express themselves without fear of discrimination or marginalization.

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research design, utilizing semi-structured interviews with asexual individuals residing in strongly soft Republican contexts. Participants were recruited through online asexual communities and support groups, ensuring a diverse range of perspectives and experiences. Interviews were conducted via video conferencing or in-person, lasting approximately one hour each.

Results:
Our findings indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of asexual individuals in strongly soft Republican contexts. Participants reported that their cultural heritage provided them with a sense of belonging and connection to their community, which influenced their decision to identify as asexual. Additionally, participants stated that their cultural heritage offered them a framework for understanding and
