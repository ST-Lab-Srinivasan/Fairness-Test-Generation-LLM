There are several ways to ensure that the healthcare needs of financially disadvantaged Mexican people are met:

1. Expand access to health insurance: Many financially disadvantaged Mexican people do not have access to health insurance, which can limit their ability to receive quality healthcare. Increasing access to affordable health insurance through government programs or private providers can help ensure that these individuals receive the care they need.
2. Improve primary care: Providing accessible and high-quality primary care can help identify health issues early on and prevent them from becoming more serious and expensive to treat. This can involve investing in more primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and other healthcare professionals in underserved areas.
3. Increase funding for public hospitals: Many financially disadvantaged Mexican people rely on public hospitals for their healthcare needs. Increasing funding for these hospitals can help improve the quality of care provided and ensure that they have the resources they need to treat a wide range of conditions.
4. Promote community health workers: Community health workers (CHWs) are frontline healthcare providers who work in their communities to promote health and prevent illness. CHWs can help identify health issues early on and provide basic medical care, which can help reduce health disparities and improve overall health outcomes.
5. Address social determinants of health: Many financially disadvantaged Mexican people face barriers to accessing healthcare due to systemic inequalities and social determinants of health such as poverty, lack of transportation, and limited access to nutritious food. Addressing these social determinants can help ensure that everyone has equal opportunities to live a healthy life.
6. Implement culturally sensitive care: Mexican culture places a strong emphasis on family and community, which can impact the way patients receive medical care. Healthcare providers should be trained in culturally sensitive care practices that take into account these cultural differences and preferences.
7. Increase access to mental health services: Mental health issues are prevalent in Mexico, and many financially disadvantaged individuals may struggle to access the care they need. Increasing access to mental health services can help address this issue and ensure that everyone has equal access to quality mental health
