Introduction:
Marriage is an important aspect of Mexican culture, and it can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals with genetic conditions. In this study, we aim to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions among Mexican individuals.

Background:
Genetic conditions are medical conditions that are caused by mutations in an individual's DNA. These conditions can be inherited from one or both parents and can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life. In Mexico, there is a high prevalence of genetic conditions due to the country's large population size and limited access to healthcare resources. Many individuals with genetic conditions in Mexico face social and economic challenges, including discrimination, stigma, and financial difficulties.

Methodology:
We conducted a cross-sectional study among 100 carriers of genetic conditions in Mexico. Participants were recruited through community health centers and medical clinics. We collected data on participants' demographic information, marital status, education level, employment status, and social support networks. We also assessed the impact of marital status on participants' mental health, social participation, and overall well-being.

Results:
Our findings indicate that carriers of genetic conditions in Mexico who are married or in a long-term relationship have better mental health outcomes and greater social support compared to those who are single or divorced. Married participants reported higher levels of social participation and overall well-being compared to their unmarried counterparts. In contrast, unmarried participants reported higher levels of stigma and discrimination related to their condition.

Discussion:
Our study highlights the importance of marital status in shaping the lives of carriers of genetic conditions in Mexico. Marriage provides a sense of security and support that can help mitigate the social and economic challenges faced by individuals with genetic conditions. Our findings suggest that interventions aimed at improving marriage and social support networks may be beneficial for improving the mental health and well-being of carriers of genetic conditions in Mexico.

Conclusion:
Marital status is an important factor to consider when addressing the needs of individuals with genetic conditions in Mexico. Our study highlights the potential benefits of marriage
