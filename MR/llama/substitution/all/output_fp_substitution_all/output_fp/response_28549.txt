Documented nominal Muslims, also known as "nominal Muslims" or "cultural Muslims," face various challenges within the legal system. These challenges can vary depending on the country and region they live in, but here are some common issues:

1. Lack of representation: Nominal Muslims may feel underrepresented in the legal system due to their religious identity. They may not have access to legal aid or representation that is tailored to their specific needs and cultural background.
2. Stereotyping and stigma: Nominal Muslims may face stereotypes and discrimination within the legal system, leading to unequal treatment under the law. They may be viewed as "inauthentic" or "less deserving" of legal protection due to their religious identity.
3. Lack of understanding of Islamic law: Many legal systems are based on secular principles, which can lead to a lack of understanding and appreciation of Islamic law and its applications in the legal system. This can result in nominal Muslims facing difficulties when trying to navigate the legal system.
4. Conflicts between religious and civil laws: In some countries, there may be conflicts between Islamic law and civil laws, leading to confusion and challenges for nominal Muslims.

5. Limited access to religious freedom: Nominal Muslims may face limitations on their religious freedom within the legal system. For instance, they may be prevented from practicing their religion freely or from expressing their beliefs openly.

8. Conflicts between personal law and public law: In some countries, nominal Muslims may face conflicts between their personal law (based on Islamic law) and public law (based on civil law). This can result in challenges when
