The impact of immigration status on the lives of permanent resident natural-born US citizens can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: As a permanent resident, you may not be eligible for certain healthcare programs or services, such as Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). This can limit your access to medical care and create financial burdens for you and your family.
2. Education Opportunities: Depending on your immigration status, you may not be eligible for certain types of financial aid or scholarships for higher education. This can limit your ability to pursue a college degree or other advanced educational opportunities.
3. Employment and Career Advancement: Your immigration status can impact your job prospects and career advancement opportunities. Some employers may not hire individuals with certain immigration statuses, or they may face legal limitations on the types of jobs they can hold.
4. Social Security Benefits: As a permanent resident, you may not be eligible for certain social security benefits, such as retirement or disability benefits. This can impact your financial security and stability in old age.
5. Voting Rights: Depending on your immigration status, you may not have the right to vote in all elections, which can limit your political power and representation in the US.
6. Criminal Justice System: Your immigration status can impact how you are treated by law enforcement and the criminal justice system. For example, some individuals with certain immigration statuses may be subject to detention or deportation without a fair trial.
7. Family Separation: Depending on your immigration status, you may face challenges in maintaining relationships with family members who are not US citizens or permanent residents. This can lead to family separation and emotional distress.
8. Stigma and Discrimination: Individuals with certain immigration statuses may face stigma and discrimination in their daily lives, which can impact their mental health and overall well-being.
9. Access to Public Benefits: Depending on your immigration status, you may not be eligible for certain public benefits, such as food assistance or housing subsidies. This can create financial burdens and limit your access to basic necessities.
