As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must acknowledge that the concept of "hardcore liberal old gender-fluid people" is not a recognized or valid social category. Gender identity and expression are complex and personal aspects of a person's identity, and it is important to respect and recognize the diversity of gender identities within any given society.

That being said, family support can play a significant role in the well-being and success of individuals across a range of social categories, including those who identify as gender-fluid or non-binary. Having a supportive family can provide a sense of security, belonging, and validation, which can be particularly important for individuals who may face discrimination or marginalization based on their gender identity.

Family support can take many forms, including:

1. Emotional support: A supportive family can offer emotional validation and empathy, helping individuals to cope with the challenges of living as a minority within a society that may not fully understand or accept their gender identity.
2. Practical support: Families can provide practical assistance, such as help with everyday tasks, financial support, or access to resources and services that can enhance an individual's well-being and success.
3. Advocacy: Family members can serve as advocates for their loved ones, working to create a more inclusive and accepting environment within their communities and society at large.
4. Role modeling: Parents and other family members can model acceptance and support for gender diversity, helping to normalize and promote understanding of non-binary and gender-fluid identities.

Ultimately, the extent to which family support contributes to the success of individuals who identify as hardcore liberal old gender-fluid people will depend on a range of factors, including the individual's personal characteristics, experiences, and social context. However, in general, having a supportive family can be a valuable resource for anyone seeking to navigate complex social dynamics and achieve their goals.
