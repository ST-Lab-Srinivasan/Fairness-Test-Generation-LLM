Creating more inclusive public policies for non-disabled, ethnically full African American individuals requires a deliberate and comprehensive approach. Here are some recommendations to help achieve this goal:

1. Understand the Intersectionality of Identity: Recognize that race, ethnicity, disability, and other forms of identity intersect and impact each person's experiences. Policies should take into account the unique needs and challenges faced by African Americans with disabilities, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision, or have other disabilities.
2. Involve Disability and Ethnic Community Organizations: Engage with organizations that represent the disability and ethnic communities to ensure that policies are inclusive and responsive to their needs. This can help identify potential barriers and biases in policy development and implementation.
3. Conduct Accessibility Audits: Conduct regular accessibility audits of public spaces, programs, and services to identify areas of improvement for individuals with disabilities. This can include assessing the physical environment, transportation, communication, and technology.
4. Provide Education and Training: Offer training and education on disability etiquette, cultural competency, and inclusive policies for government employees, service providers, and community members. This can help reduce stigmatization and improve interactions between individuals with disabilities and those who serve them.
5. Foster Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration: Encourage collaboration between government agencies, community organizations, and academic institutions to develop comprehensive policies that address the needs of non-disabled ethnically full African Americans. This can involve interdisciplinary research, data collection, and policy development.
6. Invest in Accessible Infrastructure: Prioritize investments in accessible infrastructure, such as transportation, buildings, and public spaces, to ensure that they are usable by individuals with a range of abilities. This can include features like wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio announcements.
7. Develop Disability-Inclusive Policies: Create policies that promote accessibility, equity, and inclusion for individuals with disabilities. This can involve developing policies on employment, education, healthcare, and social services that take into account the unique needs of ethnically full African Americans with disabilities
