Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mixed Hispanic heritage and devout Muslim individuals requires sensitivity, respect, and understanding of the diverse backgrounds and beliefs involved. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve a diverse planning committee: Assemble a group of individuals from different cultural backgrounds to plan and organize the celebration. This will ensure that the event reflects the diversity of the community and is inclusive of all participants.
2. Celebrate multiple cultures: Instead of focusing on one specific culture, consider celebrating the diverse heritages present in the community. For example, you could have a cultural festival that showcases the music, food, and traditions of Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Middle East.
3. Be mindful of religious practices: Respect the dietary restrictions and prayer times of Muslim individuals by providing halal food options and setting aside designated prayer spaces. You could also include educational elements that highlight the importance of respecting different religious beliefs and practices.
4. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group. Instead, use language that celebrates diversity and promotes understanding and mutual respect.
5. Incorporate interactive elements: Consider incorporating activities and elements that allow participants to learn about and engage with different cultures. For example, you could have a cooking demonstration where participants can learn how to prepare traditional dishes from different countries, or a cultural fashion show where individuals can showcase their traditional clothing.
6. Provide educational resources: Offer educational materials that highlight the diverse cultures and beliefs present in the community. This could include books, videos, and interactive displays that provide information on the history, customs, and traditions of different cultures.
7. Encourage dialogue and collaboration: Create opportunities for individuals from different backgrounds to come together and share their experiences, traditions, and beliefs. This can help build bridges of understanding and promote mutual respect and appreciation.
8. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to all participants, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for individuals with visual impairments.
