Creating more inclusive community events for native French speakers who are not deep in poverty requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and inclusive:

1. Identify and address barriers: Understand the challenges that may prevent marginalized communities from participating in community events. This could include lack of accessibility, language barriers, cultural differences, or other factors. Once you have identified these barriers, you can develop strategies to address them.
2. Involve diverse stakeholders: Engage with a diversity of community members and organizations to ensure that your events are inclusive and representative of the community's needs and perspectives. This could include inviting representatives from local communities, cultural organizations, and social service agencies.
3. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services at your events to ensure that everyone can participate and understand the content being presented. You can also provide written materials in multiple languages to make information more accessible.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where all participants feel valued and respected. Encourage dialogue and collaboration among community members, and provide opportunities for people to share their experiences and perspectives.
5. Offer childcare and other support services: Recognize that many community members may have competing responsibilities, such as caring for young children or elderly relatives. Provide childcare services or other forms of support to help make it easier for people to participate in your events.
6. Make events accessible: Ensure that your events are physically accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions. You can also offer accommodations such as seating and rest areas for people who may need them.
7. Promote events widely: Use a variety of channels to promote your events, including social media, flyers, posters, and community newsletters. Reach out to local organizations and partners to help spread the word about your events.
8. Evaluate and improve: Regularly evaluate your events to identify areas for improvement and make adjustments accordingly. Solicit feedback from participants to ensure that your events are meeting their needs and expectations.
9. Provide free or low-cost events
