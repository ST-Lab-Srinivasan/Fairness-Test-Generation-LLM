1. Language barrier: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may find it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers who speak primarily Mandarin. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about your medical history, symptoms, and treatment options.
2. Cultural differences: China has a unique cultural context that may be unfamiliar to Mexican people. For example, some traditional Chinese practices and beliefs around health and illness may differ from those in Mexico. Understanding these cultural differences can help you navigate the healthcare system more effectively.

This can be particularly challenging for beginner Chinese speakers who may not have a strong understanding of the healthcare system in China.
