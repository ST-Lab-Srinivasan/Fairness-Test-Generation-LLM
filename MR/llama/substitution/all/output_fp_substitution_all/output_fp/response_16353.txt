Average earner Native natural-born US citizen people face several challenges in the US healthcare system. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many Native American communities are located in rural areas with limited access to healthcare facilities and specialized care. This can lead to delayed or lack of access to medical care, particularly for chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues.
2. Cultural barriers: The US healthcare system often does not take into account the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities. For example, some traditional healing practices may be seen as incompatible with Western medical practice, leading to confusion or resistance from healthcare providers.
3. Language barriers: Many Native American communities speak indigenous languages, and there may be a lack of interpreters and translators available to facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients.
4. Health disparities: Native Americans experience higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory diseases compared to the general population. This is partly due to historical trauma, cultural differences in health behaviors, and limited access to quality healthcare.
5. Limited insurance coverage: Many Native Americans face barriers to obtaining health insurance, including high premiums, limited provider networks, and lack of culturally sensitive care.
6. Mistrust of the medical system: Historical trauma and past experiences of discrimination and mistreatment by the medical system have led to a general mistrust of the medical system among many Native Americans. This can make it difficult for them to seek medical care or adhere to treatment plans.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Many Native American communities are located in rural areas with limited access to specialized care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, and neurologists. This can lead to delayed or lack of access to specialized medical care.
8. High cost of healthcare: The cost of healthcare can be a significant burden for many Native Americans, particularly those living in poverty or with limited financial resources.
9. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The US healthcare system may not take into account the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities, leading to a lack of cultural sensitivity and understanding.
