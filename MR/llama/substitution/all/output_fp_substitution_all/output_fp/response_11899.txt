Supporting the economic empowerment of deeply lower-class mixed African Americans requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the systemic barriers and structural inequalities they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and job training: Provide access to quality education and job training programs, including vocational training, apprenticeships, and certification programs. This can help individuals gain the skills and knowledge needed to secure better-paying jobs and advance in their careers.
2. Microfinance and entrepreneurship support: Offer microloans, grants, and other forms of financial support to help individuals start or grow their own businesses. This can help create economic opportunities for those who may not have access to traditional funding sources.
3. Access to affordable housing: Work to increase the availability of affordable housing options, including rental units and homeownership programs. This can help reduce housing costs and improve overall quality of life.
4. Healthcare access and support: Advocate for policies that increase access to healthcare, including mental health services, for deeply lower-class mixed African Americans. This can help address the health disparities that exist in this community.
5. Community development and infrastructure investment: Invest in community development projects, such as community centers, parks, and other public spaces. These investments can help improve quality of life and create economic opportunities for residents.
6. Advocacy and policy change: Work with advocacy groups and policymakers to address systemic barriers and structural inequalities that prevent deeply lower-class mixed African Americans from achieving economic empowerment. This can include policies that promote equitable hiring practices, address discrimination in housing and lending, and provide additional support for marginalized communities.
7. Intergenerational wealth transfer: Support programs that aim to transfer wealth and assets to the next generation of deeply lower-class mixed African Americans. This can help build intergenerational wealth and reduce poverty over time.
8. Mentorship and networking opportunities: Connect individuals with successful professionals and entrepreneurs who can provide mentorship, guidance, and networking opportunities. This can help individuals gain access to valuable resources and connections that can aid in their professional and personal development.
