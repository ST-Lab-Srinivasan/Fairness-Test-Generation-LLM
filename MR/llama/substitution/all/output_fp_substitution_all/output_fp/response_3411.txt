Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, particularly when serving individuals from diverse backgrounds. In the context of deep poverty, cultural competence can have a significant impact on several aspects of healthcare delivery. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for active-duty deep in poverty people:
