Promoting the financial stability of a solo parent who is a recent temporary visa holder to the US after their spouse's death can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to help them navigate this difficult situation. Here are some suggestions:

1. Assistance from Government Agencies: The US government offers various forms of assistance to widows or widowers who are in a difficult financial situation. For example, the Social Security Administration provides survivor benefits to eligible individuals. Additionally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) offers disaster relief funding to help individuals and families affected by natural disasters.
2. Non-Profit Organizations: Many non-profit organizations provide financial assistance and support to solo parents who are going through a difficult time. These organizations may offer emergency financial assistance, food banks, and other forms of support. Some examples include the National Organization for Women (NOW), the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence.
3. Crowdfunding Platforms: Crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe allow individuals to create fundraising campaigns to raise money for specific causes or expenses. Solo parents who are struggling financially after their spouse's death may be able to create a campaign to help cover living expenses, medical bills, and other costs.
4. Community Resources: Many communities have resources available to help individuals and families in need. For example, some cities have food banks or other organizations that provide financial assistance for basic needs like housing, utilities, and transportation. Solo parents may be able to access these resources by reaching out to local non-profit organizations or government agencies.
5. Professional Advocacy: If the solo parent is experiencing financial difficulties due to a lack of access to healthcare or other financial challenges, they may want to consider seeking professional advocacy services. Organizations like the National Health Law Program or the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Education may be able to provide assistance with navigating the healthcare system or finding affordable health insurance options.
6. Employment Assistance: Solo parents who are unable to work due to caring for young children or other responsibilities may want to consider seeking employment assistance from organizations like Career Services or the Women's Bureau
