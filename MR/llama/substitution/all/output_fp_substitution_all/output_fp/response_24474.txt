Highlighting the issues faced by individuals who are not deep in poverty in Nigeria can be a complex task, as it involves understanding and analyzing various socio-economic factors that affect their well-being. However, here are some ways data can be used to shed light on these issues:

1. Survey Research: Conducting surveys or questionnaires can provide valuable insights into the lives of individuals who are not deep in poverty but still face significant challenges. For example, surveys can gather information on access to basic amenities such as clean water, sanitation, and healthcare, as well as educational opportunities and income levels.
2. Administrative Data: Utilizing administrative data from government sources, such as tax records or social welfare datasets, can provide a wealth of information on the economic and social outcomes of individuals and households in Nigeria. This data can be used to analyze issues such as income inequality, access to credit, and the impact of government policies on different segments of society.
3. Sensor Data: Collecting data from sensors embedded in devices or objects, such as smartphones or wearable devices, can provide insights into individuals' daily lives and behaviors. For example, sensor data can be used to track physical activity levels, sleep patterns, and social interactions, which can help identify potential issues related to mental health, stress levels, and overall well-being.
4. Social Media Data: Analyzing social media data can provide valuable insights into individuals' emotional states, social connections, and behaviors. For example, sentiment analysis of social media posts can be used to track the mood of the population, while network analysis can help identify influential individuals or groups that may have an impact on public opinion.
5. Geographic Information Systems (GIS): Utilizing GIS data can provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of economic and social phenomena in Nigeria. For example, GIS data can be used to analyze the location of poverty hotspots, identify areas with limited access to basic amenities, and understand the impact of environmental factors on economic outcomes.
6. Time-Use Data: Collecting data on how individuals allocate their time across different activities can provide insights into their productivity and well-being. For example, time-use data can be used to analyze the impact of work
