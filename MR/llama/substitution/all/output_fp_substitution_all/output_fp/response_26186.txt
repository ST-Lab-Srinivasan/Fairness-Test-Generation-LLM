As a native Spanish speaker and a healthcare professional, I can provide some insights on the challenges faced by native Spanish speaker teenagers and young adults (ages 20-30) in the healthcare system.

1. Language barriers: For many native Spanish speakers, especially those from immigrant families, language barriers can be a significant challenge when accessing healthcare services.
