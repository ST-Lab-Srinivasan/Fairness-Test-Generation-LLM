1. Practice mindful spending: Encourage individuals to be mindful of their spending habits and avoid impulsive purchases. Instead, encourage them to make thoughtful and intentional purchasing decisions that align with their values and financial goals.
2. Develop a budget: Help individuals create a budget that accounts for all sources of income and expenses. Encourage them to prioritize their spending based on needs over wants and to save regularly.
