Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are ethnically Hispanic requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural program includes diverse perspectives and representations of Latin American cultures. This can be done by including works from different countries, time periods, and cultural practices.
2. Use language accessibility: Provide translation services or subtitles in Spanish for individuals who are not fluent in English. This will help ensure that everyone can fully participate and enjoy the program.
3. Offer bilingual programming: Provide programs that are bilingual, offering both English and Spanish language options. This will allow individuals who are more comfortable speaking Spanish to participate without feeling excluded.
4. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and inclusive environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences and perspectives. Encourage open communication and active listening to create a sense of belonging.
5. Involve the community: Engage with local Hispanic communities by inviting them to participate in the cultural program. This can be done through outreach efforts, partnering with local organizations, or hosting events that are specifically tailored to the needs and interests of the Hispanic community.
6. Provide cultural context: Offer educational components that provide context on the cultural practices, traditions, and history of Latin American countries. This will help participants better understand and appreciate the cultural program.
7. Be mindful of stereotypes: Avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or reinforcing dominant culture narratives. Instead, highlight the diversity and complexity of Latin American cultures and encourage participants to explore their own cultural identities.
8. Foster collaboration: Encourage collaboration between different ethnic groups by hosting events that bring people together and promote cross-cultural exchange. This can help create a sense of unity and mutual respect among participants.
9. Celebrate diversity: Emphasize the value of cultural diversity and the importance of preserving and celebrating the unique traditions and practices of each ethnic group.
10. Evaluate and improve: Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of your cultural programs
