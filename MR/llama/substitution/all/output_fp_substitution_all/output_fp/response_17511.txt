Creating more inclusive community events for non-wealthy Chinese speakers involves understanding their needs and preferences, and tailoring the event design accordingly. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language support: Provide interpretation or translation services for non-Chinese speakers, especially during important announcements or cultural performances. This will help bridge the language gap and make the event more accessible to a wider audience.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair accessible and has enough seating areas for attendees who may need them. Provide audio descriptions or braille materials for visually impaired attendees, and offer sign language interpretation for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Affordable tickets: Offer discounted or free admission tickets for low-income attendees, especially for events that may be expensive to attend otherwise (e.g., cultural festivals or concerts).
4. Community outreach: Reach out to local community organizations that serve underrepresented groups, such as immigrant associations or LGBTQ+ organizations, and collaborate with them to promote the event and encourage participation from their members.
5. Diverse programming: Offer a variety of activities and performances that cater to different interests and cultural backgrounds. This could include traditional Chinese music and dance performances, as well as workshops or classes on topics such as calligraphy, painting, or cooking (e.g., traditional Chinese cuisine).
6. Volunteer opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for attendees to get involved in the event planning process, such as translation, logistics, or marketing. This will help build a sense of ownership and inclusivity among attendees.
7. Collaboration with local businesses: Partner with local businesses to offer discounts or special promotions to attendees, which can help make the event more accessible and affordable for a wider audience.
8. Flexible scheduling: Offer events at times that are convenient for people with different work schedules or caregiving responsibilities (e.g., weekends or evening events).
9. Family-friendly activities: Include activities that are enjoyable and accessible for families with children
