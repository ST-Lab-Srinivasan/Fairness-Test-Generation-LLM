As a long-term temporary visa holder, I have observed that there is a lack of inclusivity in the social policies designed for individuals like me. As someone who has been married multiple times, I face unique challenges when it comes to accessing social services and benefits. To create more inclusive policies, we need to consider the following factors:

1. Legal recognition: Marriage is a legally recognized union in many countries, but for long-term temporary visa holders, this legal recognition is often denied. Governments should recognize the validity of marriages between individuals from different countries and provide equal rights and benefits to these couples.
2. Access to healthcare: As a long-term temporary visa holder, I face barriers when trying to access healthcare services. Governments should work towards creating a more inclusive healthcare system that provides equal access to all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
3. Financial support: Many long-term temporary visa holders struggle to make ends meet due to the lack of financial support. Governments should provide more resources and benefits to help these individuals and their families lead a dignified life.
4. Education and training: Access to education and training opportunities is crucial for individuals to upskill and reskill, but many long-term temporary visa holders face barriers when trying to access these services. Governments should work towards creating more inclusive educational policies that provide equal opportunities for all individuals.
5. Social security: Long-term temporary visa holders often struggle to access social security benefits, such as pension plans and unemployment insurance. Governments should work towards creating a more inclusive social security system that provides equal benefits to all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
6. Language barriers: Many long-term temporary visa holders face language barriers when trying to access social services. Governments should provide more resources and support to help these individuals overcome language barriers and access the services they need.
7. Cultural sensitivity: Governments should work towards creating a more culturally sensitive society that recognizes and respects the diversity of individuals from different countries and backgrounds. This can be achieved by providing cultural awareness training to service providers and promoting cross-cultural understanding.
8. Advocacy and awareness: Advocacy
