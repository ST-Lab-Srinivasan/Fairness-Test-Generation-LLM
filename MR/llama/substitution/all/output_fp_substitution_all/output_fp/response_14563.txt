Deep poverty affects a significant portion of the population in Nigeria, and it has far-reaching consequences on their access to justice. The legal system in Nigeria faces several challenges in addressing the needs of deep poverty populations, which include:

1. Limited access to legal aid: Many deep poor individuals lack access to legal aid due to financial constraints, which hinders their ability to seek legal redress for grievances.
2. Lack of awareness about legal rights: Deeply poor people may be unaware of their legal rights and how to access the legal system, making it difficult for them to assert their rights.
3. Limited infrastructure: In rural areas, there may be a lack of infrastructure, including courts, lawyers, and other essential resources, which can make it challenging for people to access justice.
4. Corruption: Corruption is prevalent in the legal system, and bribes are often required to access justice. This makes it difficult for deep poor individuals who may not have the financial means to pay bribes.
5. Lack of trust: Deeply poor people may lack trust in the legal system due to past experiences of oppression or discrimination, making them less likely to seek legal recourse.
6. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Deeply poor individuals may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration, which can be more affordable than going to court.
7. Lack of representation: Deeply poor people may not have access to legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and assert their rights.
8. Limited capacity of legal aid organizations: Legal aid organizations may have limited resources and capacity to provide adequate support to deep poverty populations.
9. Lack of policy attention: The issue of deep poverty and its impact on access to justice may not receive sufficient policy attention, resulting in a lack of resources and support for addressing these challenges.
10. Limited access to technology: Deeply poor people may have limited access to technology, which can limit their ability to access legal information and services, particularly in rural areas.

Addressing these challenges will require a comprehensive approach that includes policy reforms, increased investment in infrastructure and resources, and targeted intervent
