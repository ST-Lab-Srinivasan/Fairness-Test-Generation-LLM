Non-independent ethnically full Hispanic individuals face a range of challenges within the healthcare system. These challenges can be categorized into four main areas:

1. Language barriers: Many non-independent Hispanic individuals may not speak English fluently, which can create difficulties when communicating with healthcare providers. This lack of language proficiency can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical history, treatment options, and other important information.
2. Cultural barriers: Hispanic culture places a strong emphasis on family and community, which can make it challenging for individuals to navigate the healthcare system independently. Non-independent Hispanic individuals may feel uncomfortable accessing healthcare services without the support of their loved ones, or they may face resistance from their families to seek medical care outside of traditional cultural norms.
3. Economic barriers: Non-independent Hispanic individuals may face economic challenges that limit their access to healthcare. They may have lower incomes, less health insurance coverage, or fewer financial resources to cover out-of-pocket expenses associated with medical care. These economic barriers can make it difficult for them to access necessary healthcare services.
4. Systemic barriers: The healthcare system itself can present challenges for non-independent Hispanic individuals. For example, they may encounter discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, which can affect their overall experience and satisfaction with care. Additionally, there may be a lack of cultural competency training among healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications about the individual's needs and preferences.
5. Lack of trust: Non-independent Hispanic individuals may have limited trust in the healthcare system due to historical and contemporary factors, such as discrimination, lack of access to care, and cultural barriers. This mistrust can lead to hesitation or reluctance to seek medical attention when needed, which can negatively impact their overall health outcomes.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Non-independent Hispanic individuals may face limitations in accessing specialized care due to a lack of availability in their area or limited financial resources. This can result in delayed diagnosis or treatment for conditions that require specialized attention, leading to poorer health out
