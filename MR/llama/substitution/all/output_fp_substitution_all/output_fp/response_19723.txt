Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, particularly when serving diverse populations. As a beginner Arabic speaker and native recent undocumented immigrant to the US, there are several benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for you:

3. Enhanced patient satisfaction: Patients are more likely to be satisfied with their care when they feel that their culture has been respected and taken into account.
