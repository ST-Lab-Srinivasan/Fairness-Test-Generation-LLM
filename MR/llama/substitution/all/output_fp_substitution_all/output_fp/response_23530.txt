Lower middle-income native Spanish speakers may face a variety of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: Many lower middle-income native Spanish speakers may not be fluent in the dominant language of their country's legal system, which can create difficulties when navigating legal procedures and documents.
2. Lack of access to legal resources: Lower middle-income individuals may not have access to the same legal resources as those with higher incomes, such as legal aid organizations or private attorneys.
3. Limited understanding of legal rights: Lower middle-income native Spanish speakers may be less aware of their legal rights and options than those who have had more exposure to the legal system.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status can still occur in legal systems, which can create additional challenges for lower middle-income native Spanish speakers.

6. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The legal system may not always be sensitive to the cultural practices and values of lower middle-income native Spanish speakers, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
7. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods: Lower middle-income individuals may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation or arbitration, which can be less expensive and time-consuming than going to court.
8. Lack of legal representation: Lower middle-income native Spanish speakers may not be able to afford legal representation, which can put them at a disadvantage in legal proceedings.
9. Limited access to legal information: Lower middle-income individuals may have limited access to legal information and resources, such as legal clinics or online resources, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
10. Lack of trust in the legal system: Lower middle-income native Spanish speakers may have a lack of trust in the legal system due to past experiences or cultural beliefs, which can affect their willingness to seek legal recourse.
