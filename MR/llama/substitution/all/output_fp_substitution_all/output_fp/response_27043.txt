As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "infant non-binary long-time civilian people" is not a recognized legal term or category. The legal system does not currently have any provisions or protections specifically for individuals who identify as non-binary or who are long-time civilians.

However, there are some challenges that individuals who do not identify with traditional gender categories may face in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of recognition and protection: Non-binary individuals may face discrimination and marginalization in various areas of life, including the legal system. They may be denied access to basic rights and protections, such as the right to their preferred name and pronouns, or the right to legal recognition of their gender identity.
2. Inadequate legal frameworks: Many legal systems lack provisions that specifically address the needs and concerns of non-binary individuals. This can result in a lack of protection against discrimination, violence, and marginalization.
3. Limited access to justice: Non-binary individuals may face barriers when seeking legal recourse, such as difficulty accessing legal aid or representation due to discrimination based on their gender identity.
4. Invisibility and erasure: Non-binary individuals may be invisible or erased in legal documentation, such as birth certificates, passports, and other identification documents, which can lead to difficulties in proving one's identity and accessing basic rights and services.
5. Stigma and social exclusion: Non-binary individuals may face stigma and social exclusion in various areas of life, including the legal system, which can further marginalize and isolate them.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not limited to non-binary individuals but can also affect other marginalized groups, such as LGBTQ+ individuals, people of color, and those with disabilities. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes legal, social, and cultural changes to create a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
