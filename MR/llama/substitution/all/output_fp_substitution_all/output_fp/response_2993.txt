Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, particularly when working with diverse populations, including Native Spanish speakers with cognitive impairments. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved patient satisfaction and trust: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they build trust and rapport with their patients. This is critical for individuals with cognitive impairments who may have difficulty communicating their needs or preferences.
