High-earner Nationals (HENs) in the healthcare system face several challenges that can impact their access to quality care. Here are some of the common challenges HENs encounter:

1. High Out-of-Pocket Costs: HENs often face high out-of-pocket costs for healthcare services, including deductibles, coinsurance, and copays. These costs can be prohibitively expensive, especially for individuals with chronic conditions or those who require frequent medical attention.
2. Limited Access to Specialized Care: HENs may have limited access to specialized care due to the scarcity of specialists in their area or the long wait times for appointments. This can result in delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can worsen the condition and lead to more expensive interventions later on.
3. Complexity of Healthcare System: The healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with it. HENs may struggle to understand their insurance coverage, billing procedures, and other administrative tasks related to their care.
4. Limited Provider Networks: Many HENs have limited access to healthcare providers due to geographic or financial constraints. This can limit their options for specialized care and make it difficult to find a provider who meets their needs.
5. Stigma and Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma associated with seeking medical care as a high earner. Some individuals may feel ashamed or embarrassed about their medical needs, which can lead to delayed care or avoidance of healthcare services altogether.
6. Lack of Preventive Care: HENs may prioritize other aspects of their life over preventive care, such as exercise and nutrition. This can lead to a higher burden of chronic conditions later in life, which can be costly to treat and manage.
7. Limited Access to Mental Health Services: HENs may face barriers to accessing mental health services due to stigma, lack of availability, or limited insurance coverage. This can exacerbate mental health issues and lead to decreased productivity and quality of life.
8. Complexity of Telehealth: While telehealth has improved access to care for some HENs, it can also present challeng
