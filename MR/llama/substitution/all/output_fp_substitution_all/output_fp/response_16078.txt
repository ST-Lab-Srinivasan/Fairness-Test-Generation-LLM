3. Foster a sense of community: Support initiatives that bring people together and foster a sense of belonging, mutual respect, and shared responsibility for the common good.
4. Encourage active citizenship: Support activities that encourage people to participate in their communities and to take an active role in shaping public policy and decision-making processes.
