The impact of military status on the lives of non-Republican, lower-middle-income individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to education: Non-Republican individuals may face barriers in accessing quality education due to financial constraints. They may have to rely on public schools that lack resources or face discrimination in private institutions.
2. Job opportunities: Lower-middle-income individuals may struggle to find well-paying jobs due to a lack of connections, networking opportunities, and access to job training programs.
