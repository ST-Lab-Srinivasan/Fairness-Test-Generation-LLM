Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native Chinese speakers who are recently undocumented to the US. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes their experiences:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging and identity for native Chinese speakers, especially those who have recently immigrated to the US. It helps them connect with their roots and maintain a sense of self.
2. Cultural practices: Many native Chinese speakers continue to practice traditional cultural practices such as festivals, rituals, and customs in the US. These practices help them preserve their cultural identity and maintain connections with their family and community back in China.
3. Language preservation: Native Chinese speakers may feel a strong connection to their language and cultural heritage, which can influence their language use and communication styles in the US. They may prefer to speak Chinese at home or with other native speakers, or they may find comfort in speaking Chinese as a way to maintain a sense of cultural identity.
4. Community building: Cultural heritage can play a role in building community among native Chinese speakers in the US. Shared cultural practices and traditions can create a sense of belonging and help build connections between individuals who may be geographically dispersed.
5. Resistance and activism: For some native Chinese speakers, cultural heritage can serve as a means of resistance and activism against systemic oppression and discrimination. By embracing their cultural identity and practices, they may challenge dominant narratives and power structures in the US.
6. Negotiating identity: Native Chinese speakers may use cultural heritage as a way to navigate complex identities in the US. They may draw on cultural traditions and practices to challenge stereotypes and assumptions about their identity, and to assert their agency and autonomy.
7. Intergenerational transmission: Cultural heritage can be transmitted across generations within native Chinese speaker communities in the US. Elders may pass down cultural practices and traditions to younger generations, helping to maintain cultural continuity and identity.
8. Influencing consumer behavior: Native Chinese speakers may use cultural heritage as a means of influencing consumer behavior in the US. For example, they may prefer to shop at businesses that reflect their cultural values or support causes that align with their cultural identity.
