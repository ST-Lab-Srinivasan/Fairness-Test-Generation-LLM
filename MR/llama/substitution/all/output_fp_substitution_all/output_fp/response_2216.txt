As a Buddhist myself, I believe that creating more inclusive social policies for casual Buddhists in their late 30s requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the diversity of Buddhist practices: Recognize that there are many different forms of Buddhism, each with its own unique beliefs, practices, and communities. Be inclusive of all these traditions and avoid imposing any one specific practice or belief system on others.
2. Foster a sense of belonging: Create spaces where casual Buddhists can come together to learn, share, and support one another. This could involve organizing events, workshops, or study groups that are open to people of all levels of experience and knowledge.
3. Address accessibility issues: Ensure that social policies are accessible and inclusive for everyone, regardless of their abilities or limitations. For example, make sure that any events or gatherings are wheelchair-accessible, and provide accommodations for those with hearing or visual impairments.
4. Encourage intergenerational dialogue: Create opportunities for people of different ages to come together and share their experiences and perspectives. This could involve pairing older, more experienced Buddhists with newer practitioners, or hosting events that bring together people of all ages.
5. Foster a sense of community: Encourage casual Buddhists to connect with one another and build meaningful relationships. This could involve creating online communities or forums where people can share their thoughts and experiences, as well as organizing in-person events that allow people to come together and connect in person.
6. Promote mindfulness and compassion: Encourage casual Buddhists to cultivate mindfulness and compassion in their daily lives. This could involve offering guided meditation sessions or workshops on mindfulness practices, as well as promoting acts of kindness and generosity within the community.
7. Provide resources for personal growth: Offer resources and support for casual Buddhists who are interested in deepening their practice. This could involve providing access to books, articles, or other materials that can help people learn more about Buddhism, as well as offering workshops or classes on various aspects of the religion.
