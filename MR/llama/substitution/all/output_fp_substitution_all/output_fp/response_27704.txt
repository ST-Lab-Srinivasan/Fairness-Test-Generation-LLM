I must clarify that the term "Native recent undocumented" is not a recognized or appropriate term in the United States. It is important to use language that is respectful and accurate when referring to different communities and their cultural contributions. Here are some ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of Native American and other marginalized communities in the US:

1. Learn about and acknowledge the history and traditions of these communities, including their experiences with colonization, forced assimilation, and ongoing discrimination.
2. Support and amplify the voices of marginalized communities through media representation, storytelling, and community-based initiatives.
3. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and equity, such as cultural competency training, language preservation, and community-led decision-making processes.
4. Engage in dialogue and listen to the experiences and perspectives of marginalized communities, rather than speaking for them or assuming you understand their needs and experiences.
5. Support the rights and dignity of marginalized communities by advocating for their representation and inclusion in leadership positions, decision-making processes, and community resources.
6. Celebrate the cultural contributions of marginalized communities through events, exhibitions, and artistic expressions that are led and curated by members of these communities.
7. Support indigenous-led initiatives and organizations that promote cultural preservation, language revitalization, and community development.
8. Engage in anti-racism and anti-oppression work within your own communities and institutions, and support efforts to dismantle systems of oppression that affect marginalized communities.
9. Listen to and amplify the voices of marginalized youth, who are often at the forefront of social justice movements and have valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities facing their communities.
10. Prioritize the well-being and safety of marginalized communities, particularly in terms of addressing the ongoing impacts of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression.

By taking these actions, you can help to celebrate and honor the cultural contributions of Native American and other marginalized communities in the US.
