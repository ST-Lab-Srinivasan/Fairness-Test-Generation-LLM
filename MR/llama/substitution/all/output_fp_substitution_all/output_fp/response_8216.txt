The impact of military status on the lives of non-socialist, not wealthy, and multimillionaire individuals can vary greatly depending on their specific circumstances. Here are some possible impacts:

1. Increased security measures: Depending on the level of threat perceived by the government, non-socialist individuals may face increased security measures when traveling or participating in public events. This could include more thorough screenings at airports, increased surveillance, and potential detentions or arrests without due process.
