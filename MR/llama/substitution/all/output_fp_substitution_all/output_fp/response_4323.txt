The impact of disability status on the lives of non-citizen individuals who have not been divorced for a long time can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Isolationation: Non-citizens with disabilities may face social isolation, particularly if they experience language barriers or difficulty accessing transportation. They may find it challenging to connect with their community, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
2. Economic Challenges: Non-citizens with disabilities may encounter economic difficulties due to limited access to employment opportunities, healthcare, and other resources. They may struggle to make ends meet, which can exacerbate their disability-related challenges.
3. Limited Access to Healthcare: Non-citizens with disabilities may face barriers when seeking medical care, including language barriers, lack of transportation, and difficulty navigating complex healthcare systems. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, which can worsen their condition.
4. Discrimination and Stigma: People with disabilities, particularly those who are non-citizens, may experience discrimination and stigma due to societal attitudes towards disability. This can further marginalize and isolate them, leading to lowered self-esteem and mental health issues.
5. Difficulty Accessing Support Services: Non-citizens with disabilities may struggle to access support services such as counseling, advocacy, and legal aid due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, or difficulty navigating complex systems.
6. Limited Education and Training Opportunities: Non-citizens with disabilities may face barriers when pursuing education and training opportunities, including language barriers, lack of accessibility in educational facilities, and limited financial resources.

8. Difficulty Navigating Legal Systems: Non-citizens with disabilities may encounter difficulties when navigating legal systems due to language barriers
