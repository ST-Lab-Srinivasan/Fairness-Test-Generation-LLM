Supporting the social inclusion of beginners in French language learners who may be separated or isolated can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies and approaches that can help. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language exchange programs: Organize regular language exchange events where beginner French speakers can practice speaking with native French speakers. This will give them an opportunity to interact with people who speak the language fluently and get a chance to improve their speaking skills.
2. Integration courses: Offer integration courses specifically designed for beginners in French language learners. These courses can include activities such as conversation classes, cultural events, and outings to help them meet other people and build relationships.
3. Online communities: Create online communities or forums where beginner French speakers can connect with each other and practice their language skills in a supportive environment. This can be done through social media platforms or dedicated online language learning communities.
4. Language buddy system: Pair beginners with more advanced learners who can act as language buddies and provide support and guidance. This can help build confidence and encourage interaction between learners.
5. Cultural events: Organize cultural events such as movie nights, cooking classes, or art exhibitions where beginner French speakers can interact with other people and practice their language skills in a relaxed setting.
6. Volunteer opportunities: Provide opportunities for beginners to volunteer in their community, such as at local schools or non-profit organizations. This can help them meet new people and build relationships while also improving their language skills.
7. Language learning apps: Utilize language learning apps that provide interactive features and games to help beginners practice their language skills in a fun and engaging way.
8. Social activities: Organize social activities such as potlucks, game nights, or outdoor events where beginner French speakers can interact with other people and practice their language skills in a relaxed setting.
9. Tutoring programs: Offer tutoring programs specifically designed for beginners who need extra support and guidance in learning the language.
10. Mentorship programs: Pair beginners with experienced learners or native speakers who can act as mentors and provide guidance and support throughout their language learning journey.
