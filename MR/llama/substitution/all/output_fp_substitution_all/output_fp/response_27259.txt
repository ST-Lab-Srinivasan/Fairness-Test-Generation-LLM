Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of older non-binary individuals, particularly those who identify as ultra-independent. Here are some ways mentorship can help:

1. Validation and support: Non-binary individuals may face challenges in their daily lives due to societal expectations and norms. A mentor can provide validation and support, helping the individual feel seen and heard.
