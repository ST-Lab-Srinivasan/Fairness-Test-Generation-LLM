Creating more inclusive public spaces for traditionalist Native Spanish speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach to design, planning, and management. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Incorporate cultural significance: Incorporate elements of traditionalist Native Spanish culture into the design of public spaces. This could include incorporating traditional architecture, art, or symbolism into the space. For example, using adobe or other natural materials native to the region in the construction of buildings or pathways can help create a sense of place and connection to the land.
2. Provide accessible amenities: Ensure that public spaces are equipped with amenities that are accessible to traditionalist Native Spanish speakers. This could include Braille signage, audio descriptions of visual content, or other accommodations that facilitate accessibility.
3. Promote language access: Provide interpreters or translation services for traditionalist Native Spanish speakers who may not speak the dominant language of the region. This can help ensure that individuals have equal access to information and services in their preferred language.
4. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for traditionalist Native Spanish speakers to connect with one another and feel a sense of belonging in public spaces. This could include hosting cultural events or activities, or creating spaces for informal gatherings and socialization.
5. Involve traditionalist Native Spanish communities in decision-making processes: Ensure that traditionalist Native Spanish communities are involved in the planning and decision-making process around public spaces. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account and that the space is designed to meet their unique requirements.
6. Provide quiet spaces: Traditionalist Native Spanish speakers may prefer quieter, more peaceful environments for relaxation or contemplation. Providing designated quiet spaces in public spaces can help facilitate these activities.
7. Offer cultural education: Offer educational programs or resources that provide an introduction to traditionalist Native Spanish culture and history. This can help promote understanding and appreciation of the culture among other members of the community.
8. Create immersive experiences: Design public spaces that offer immersive experiences that allow individuals to engage with traditionalist Native Spanish culture in a meaningful way. For example, creating a space that features traditional music, dance, or art can help foster a deeper connection
