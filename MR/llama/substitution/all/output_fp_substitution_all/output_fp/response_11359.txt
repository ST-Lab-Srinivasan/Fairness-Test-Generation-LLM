I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote discrimination or exclusion based on race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, have the right to participate in sports and other activities without facing discrimination or barriers.

Instead of focusing on ways to exclude certain groups of people, it's important to work towards creating an inclusive and diverse environment where everyone can feel welcome and valued. Here are some suggestions for promoting inclusion in sports:

1. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials and resources that promote diversity and inclusion in sports. This can include information on the benefits of diversity, how to create an inclusive environment, and strategies for overcoming barriers to participation.
2. Encourage diversity in leadership: Ensure that leadership positions in sports organizations are diverse and representative of the community. This can help create a more inclusive culture and promote greater diversity in the sport.
3. Create safe spaces: Provide safe and inclusive spaces for individuals from underrepresented groups to participate in sports without facing discrimination or harassment.
4. Offer support and resources: Provide support and resources to help individuals from underrepresented groups overcome barriers to participation, such as financial assistance, coaching, and mentorship.
5. Promote role models and representation: Showcase diverse role models and representatives in sports leadership positions, media coverage, and marketing campaigns. This can help inspire and motivate individuals from underrepresented groups to participate in sports.

Remember, inclusion is everyone's responsibility, and it requires a collective effort to create a more diverse and inclusive environment for all.
