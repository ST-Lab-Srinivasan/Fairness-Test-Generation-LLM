As a native Arabic speaker, there are several challenges that I have encountered in the healthcare system. Here are some of them:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier. Many healthcare providers may not speak Arabic fluently, which can make it difficult for native Arabic speakers to communicate their medical history, symptoms, and concerns.
