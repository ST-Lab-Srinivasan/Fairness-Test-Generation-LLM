Creating more inclusive public policies for recently retired active duty military immigrant individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions:

1. Streamline the immigration process: Retired military personnel often face challenges in navigating complex immigration procedures. Governments can simplify the process by providing dedicated support channels, including one-stop shops for immigration applications and regular updates on processing times.
2. Offer language training and cultural orientation: Many retired military personnel may struggle with language barriers or cultural differences upon arriving in their new country. Providing access to language training and cultural orientation programs can help them better navigate their new surroundings and connect with local communities.
3. Encourage employment opportunities: Retired military personnel often possess valuable skills and experience, but may face difficulties finding suitable civilian employment due to language barriers or unfamiliarity with local job markets. Governments can work with businesses to create job placement programs specifically tailored for this group, leveraging their unique skill sets and experiences.
4. Provide access to healthcare and mental health services: Military veterans often experience higher rates of mental health issues due to the trauma they have endured. Ensuring access to quality healthcare and mental health services can help them manage these challenges more effectively, reducing the likelihood of suicide and improving overall well-being.
5. Support social integration: Social isolation is a common challenge faced by many retired military personnel, particularly those who have relocated to a new country. Governments can encourage social integration through community events, volunteer opportunities, and other activities that foster connections between retired military individuals and their host communities.
6. Offer educational opportunities: Many retired military personnel may be interested in pursuing further education or training to adapt to their new civilian life. Governments can provide financial assistance or scholarships specifically tailored for this group, helping them acquire new skills and knowledge to enhance their employability.
7. Create mentorship programs: Pairing recently retired military personnel with experienced immigrants or veterans of the host country can help them navigate cultural differences and build social connections more effectively. Mentors can provide guidance on how to access local resources, find employment, and become involved in their new communities.
