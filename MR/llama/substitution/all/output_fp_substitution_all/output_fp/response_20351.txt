The legal system in China has undergone significant changes since the Communist Party came to power in 1949. While the legal framework has expanded and become more complex, there are still challenges faced by Marxist native Chinese speakers in the legal system. Here are some of the key challenges:

1. Lack of Legal Literacy: Many Marxist native Chinese speakers may not have a deep understanding of the legal system, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the law. This lack of legal literacy can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of the law, which can result in injustices.
2. Limited Access to Legal Resources: In rural areas, there may be limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, and courts. This can make it difficult for Marxist native Chinese speakers to seek legal recourse when their rights are violated.
3. Cultural Barriers: The legal system in China is based on the civil law tradition, which may not always be aligned with the cultural values and beliefs of Marxist native Chinese speakers. For example, the concept of "guilt" is a central tenet of the criminal justice system in China, but it may not resonate with the collectivist values of many Marxist native Chinese speakers.
