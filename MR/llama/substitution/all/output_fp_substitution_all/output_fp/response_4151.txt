Addressing the needs of long-term divorced, extreme ultra-independent individuals in disaster response requires a tailored approach that takes into account their unique circumstances and challenges. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Recognize their independence: Acknowledge and respect the individual's desire for autonomy and self-sufficiency. This may involve creating flexible support systems that allow them to maintain their independence while still receiving needed assistance.
2. Focus on personalized support: Each person has unique needs in a disaster response situation. Offer personalized support based on their specific circumstances, such as providing transportation, temporary housing, or financial assistance tailored to their individual situation.
