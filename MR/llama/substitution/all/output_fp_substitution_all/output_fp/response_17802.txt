Ensuring that the healthcare needs of native Chinese speakers living in poverty are met can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can be employed to address this issue:

1. Community-based healthcare: Establishing community-based healthcare programs can help reach out to vulnerable populations, including those living in poverty. These programs can provide preventive care, chronic disease management, and mental health services in a culturally sensitive manner.
2. Mobile health clinics: Setting up mobile health clinics in rural or hard-to-reach areas can help reach out to people who may not have access to basic healthcare services. These clinics can provide primary care, dental care, and other essential health services.
3. Telemedicine: Utilizing telemedicine services can help bridge the gap between urban and rural areas, as well as between those who have access to healthcare facilities and those who do not. This can involve using video conferencing or other digital technologies to provide remote consultations and monitoring.
4. Public-private partnerships: Collaborating with private organizations and community groups can help leverage resources and expertise to provide comprehensive healthcare services to underserved populations. These partnerships can also help increase awareness and education about health issues among vulnerable communities.
5. Capacity building: Strengthening the capacity of local healthcare providers through training and support can help improve the quality of care and ensure that it is culturally appropriate for native Chinese speakers. This can involve providing training on evidence-based practices, as well as cultural competency training to promote greater understanding of the needs of diverse patient populations.
6. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocating for policies that address the root causes of poverty and inequality can help ensure that healthcare services are more equitably distributed. This may involve working with government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and community groups to push for policy changes that promote greater access to healthcare for marginalized populations.
7. Social determinants of health: Addressing the social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, and housing, can help improve overall health outcomes for native Chinese speakers living in poverty. This may involve working with community organizations and government agencies to promote policies that address these factors.
