Creating more inclusive social policies for native Chinese speaker devout Muslim individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions:

1. Recognize the importance of religious freedom: The Chinese government should recognize the right of Native Chinese Muslims to practice their religion freely, without fear of persecution or discrimination. This includes allowing them to build mosques, hold religious gatherings, and observe their festivals and holidays.
2. Promote interfaith dialogue: Encouraging dialogue between Muslims and other religious groups in China can help promote mutual understanding and respect. This can be done through joint cultural and religious events, as well as through education and outreach programs.
3. Support Muslim-owned businesses: Providing financial support to Muslim-owned businesses can help create economic opportunities for Native Chinese Muslims and promote their economic empowerment.
4. Implement policies to address Islamophobia: Developing policies that address Islamophobia and discrimination against Native Chinese Muslims can help create a more inclusive social environment. This can include education campaigns to combat negative stereotypes and promote tolerance, as well as legal protections for Muslims against hate crimes and discrimination.
5. Provide access to halal food: Ensuring that Native Chinese Muslims have access to halal food can help address their dietary needs and promote their well-being. This can be done through the establishment of halal food vendors and restaurants, as well as through government support for halal food production and distribution.
6. Encourage diversity in education: Incorporating diverse perspectives and cultural practices into education can help promote inclusivity and respect for Native Chinese Muslims. This can include teaching about Islamic culture and history, as well as promoting interfaith dialogue and understanding.
7. Address language barriers: Many Native Chinese Muslims may face language barriers that hinder their ability to access services and opportunities. Providing language support and interpretation services can help address these barriers and promote inclusivity.
8. Support community development: Investing in community development programs can help build stronger, more cohesive communities that value diversity and promote social inclusion. This can include initiatives to improve housing, education, and health
