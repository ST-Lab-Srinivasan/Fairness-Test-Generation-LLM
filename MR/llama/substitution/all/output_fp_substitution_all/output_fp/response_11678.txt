To ensure that the educational needs of beginner English speaker partnered students are met, here are some strategies that teachers and educators can implement:

1. Assess their language proficiency: Conduct a language proficiency assessment to identify the students' strengths, weaknesses, and areas of improvement. This will help teachers tailor their instruction to meet the students' specific needs.
2. Use visual aids and simple language: Beginner English speakers may struggle with complex language structures and vocabulary. Using visual aids, such as pictures or videos, and breaking down language into simpler components can help them understand and retain information better.
3. Provide opportunities for practice: Offer students plenty of opportunities to practice speaking and listening in English. This could include role-playing activities, conversation practices with peers, or listening to English language materials like podcasts or audiobooks.
4. Foster a supportive learning environment: Encourage students to ask questions and make mistakes without fear of judgment. A supportive learning environment can help students feel more comfortable and motivated to learn.
5. Provide feedback and encouragement: Offer constructive feedback on students' language use, highlighting areas of improvement and progress made. Also, provide plenty of encouragement and praise for effort and progress.
6. Use technology-based resources: Utilize digital tools and apps that cater to beginner English learners, such as language learning games, podcasts, or mobile apps with interactive exercises.
7. Develop a customized lesson plan: Create a tailored lesson plan based on the students' needs, goals, and learning styles. This could include a mix of grammar, vocabulary, listening, speaking, reading, and writing activities.
8. Incorporate cultural education: Beginner English learners may find it helpful to understand the culture associated with the language they are learning. Incorporating cultural education into lessons can help students better grasp the nuances of the language and its usage.
9. Encourage self-directed learning: Encourage students to take ownership of their learning by setting goals, tracking progress, and seeking additional resources outside of class time.
10. Collaborate with other educators: Work with other teachers and educators who specialize in teaching English as a second language
