To highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers and beginner French speakers, we can use data in several ways:

1. Language proficiency surveys: Conduct surveys to assess the language proficiency of both English and French learners. The surveys can be designed to gather information on their language learning experiences, challenges, and goals.
2. Data visualization: Use data visualization tools to display the survey responses in an engaging and easy-to-understand format. For example, you could create bar graphs or scatter plots to show the distribution of language proficiency levels among learners.
3. Language learning analytics: Collect data on learners' language use patterns, such as the amount of time spent practicing speaking, listening, reading, and writing in each language. This data can help identify areas where learners struggle the most.
4. Sentiment analysis: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze learners' feedback and sentiment. For instance, you could use sentiment analysis tools to gauge learners' satisfaction with language learning resources or their feelings about the difficulty level of a particular language skill.
5. User behavior tracking: Track learners' behavior on language learning platforms, such as the pages they visit, the activities they complete, and the time spent on each activity. This data can help identify common patterns of behavior that may indicate difficulties or areas where learners need more support.
6. Language learning milestones: Set language learning milestones for both English and French learners and track their progress over time. This data can help identify achievements and challenges faced by learners at different stages of their language learning journey.
7. Social media analysis: Analyze social media posts related to language learning, such as tweets, Facebook updates, or Reddit comments. This data can provide insights into common issues and challenges faced by language learners in a more informal setting.
8. Educational assessments: Conduct standardized assessments to evaluate the language proficiency of English and French learners. The results of these assessments can help identify areas where learners need improvement and track their progress over time.
9. Learner profiles: Create detailed profiles of both English and French learners, including their language learning history, goals, and challenges. This data can help identify common patterns and trends among learners
