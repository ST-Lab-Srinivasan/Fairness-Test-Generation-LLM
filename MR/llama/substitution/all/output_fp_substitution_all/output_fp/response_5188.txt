Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for late 30s beginner Spanish speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these experiences more accessible and enjoyable:

1. Provide English subtitles or translations: Offering English subtitles or translations during cultural events can help beginners understand the context and significance of the celebration. This can be done through live subtitling or pre-recorded videos available on screens throughout the event space.
2. Use visual aids and props: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, posters, and props to help explain cultural practices and traditions. For example, during a Dia de los Muertos celebration, you could display images of traditional altars or sugar skulls to help beginners understand the significance of these symbols.
3. Offer guided tours or workshops: Organize guided tours or workshops specifically designed for beginner Spanish speakers. These could include hands-on activities, such as making traditional crafts or cooking authentic dishes. This will provide an opportunity for participants to engage with the culture in a more interactive and immersive way.
4. Hire bilingual staff and volunteers: Ensure that staff and volunteers involved in organizing and hosting cultural events are fluent in Spanish. This can help beginners feel more comfortable and confident when participating in the celebration.
5. Provide language support: Offer language support during cultural events, such as real-time translation or interpretation services. This can be especially helpful for beginner Spanish speakers who may struggle to follow conversations or understand nuances of the language.
6. Foster a sense of community: Encourage participants to mingle and interact with each other during cultural events. This can help beginners feel more included and connected to the broader community, which can enhance their overall experience.
7. Offer cultural immersion programs: Design special programs that allow beginner Spanish speakers to fully immerse themselves in the culture. These could include homestays with local families or guided tours of cultural landmarks.
8. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that the event space is accessible and welcoming for beginners. This could involve providing clear signage, accessible seating, and comfortable spaces for participants to relax and social
