Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of native Arabic speakers, particularly those who are over 90 years old. In many cases, political beliefs and affiliations can shape one's identity, relationships, and opportunities. This study aims to explore the impact of political affiliation on the lives of native Arabic speakers aged 90 and above, focusing on their experiences, challenges, and triumphs.

Literature Review:
Studies have shown that political affiliation can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their social relationships, economic opportunities, and overall well-being (1,2). For example, research has found that individuals who identify as members of a particular political group tend to form closer bonds with others who share the same beliefs, leading to a stronger sense of community and belonging (3). However, this can also lead to social isolation and exclusion for those who do not conform to the dominant political ideology.

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample will consist of 100 native Arabic speakers aged 90 and above, recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. Data will be collected through in-depth interviews, surveys, and focus groups.

Data Analysis:
The qualitative data collected through interviews and focus groups will be analyzed using thematic analysis, while the quantitative data from the survey will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, such as regression analysis.

Expected Outcomes:
This study is expected to provide insights into the impact of political affiliation on the lives of native Arabic speakers aged 90 and above. The findings may reveal how political beliefs shape social relationships, economic opportunities, and overall well-being in old age. Specifically, the study may uncover the following:

1. Political affiliation as a source of social support: The study may find that individuals with similar political beliefs form closer bonds and provide greater emotional support to one another, particularly during times of social isolation or exclusion.
2. Economic opportunities and barriers: The study may uncover how political affiliation can affect access
