Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-recently married long-time active duty military individuals can be achieved by considering their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the challenges they face: Military spouses often face unique challenges such as frequent moves, deployments, and separations from their partners. Long-time active duty military personnel may also have to deal with physical and mental health issues related to their service. Consider these challenges when planning events.
2. Involve them in the planning process: Engage military spouses and long-time active duty personnel in the planning process through surveys, focus groups, or advisory committees. This will ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and they feel invested in the event's success.
3. Provide childcare and other support: Offering childcare services during events can help military spouses who may have to juggle work and family responsibilities. Additionally, consider providing other forms of support such as transportation or respite care for families with special needs.
4. Create a diverse lineup of entertainment: Offer a variety of entertainment options that cater to different tastes and preferences. This could include live music, dance performances, theater productions, or cultural festivals.
5. Foster a sense of community: Military spouses and long-time active duty personnel often feel isolated due to their unique circumstances. Create opportunities for attendees to connect with one another through icebreaker activities, group discussions, or networking events.
6. Offer accessible programming: Ensure that all events are wheelchair accessible and offer accommodations for attendees with disabilities. This can include American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials.
7. Provide resources and information: Offer resources and information relevant to military spouses and long-time active duty personnel, such as financial planning advice, mental health support, or career development opportunities.
8. Celebrate their contributions: Acknowledge the sacrifices and contributions of military spouses and long-time active duty personnel through public recognition or personalized thank-you messages.
9. Foster a sense of pride: Create events that celebrate military culture and heritage, such as flag-raising
