This can help to break down barriers and promote social integration between hetero-mentally disabled groups.
5. Fostering creativity: Cultural exchange programs can provide a platform for individuals with mental disabilities to express themselves creatively through art, music, dance, or other forms of expression. This can help to promote self-esteem and confidence, as well as provide an outlet for emotional expression.
