This can include understanding the values, beliefs, and practices of Arab cultures, as well as learning how to create an inclusive classroom environment.

Parental Involvement: Engage parents in their children's education by providing opportunities for them to participate in school events, volunteer in the classroom, and communicate with teachers about their child's progress. This can help build a supportive learning environment for Arabic-speaking students.
