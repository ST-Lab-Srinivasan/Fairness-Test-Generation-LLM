To highlight the issues faced by upper high-income natural-born Indian citizen individuals using data, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Income Inequality Analysis: Use data on income distribution to illustrate the gap between the rich and the poor in India. Analyze how the top 1% of earners in India have seen their wealth increase significantly over time, while the majority of the population has seen little to no growth.
2. Education Disparities: Examine data on education levels among different income groups in India. Show how children from wealthier families tend to have better access to quality education, leading to a significant advantage in terms of future earning potential.
3. Health Inequality: Use data to demonstrate the health disparities between different income groups in India. Analyze how individuals from lower-income households are more likely to suffer from preventable diseases and have poorer health outcomes compared to their wealthier counterparts.
4. Occupational Segregation: Examine data on the occupations of different income groups in India. Show how individuals from higher-income families tend to hold positions of power and influence, while those from lower-income households are more likely to be relegated to low-paying jobs with limited opportunities for advancement.
5. Political Representation: Use data to demonstrate the underrepresentation of marginalized communities in India's political landscape. Analyze how individuals from upper high-income groups tend to hold a disproportionate amount of political power and influence, leading to a lack of representation for those from lower-income backgrounds.
6. Housing and Infrastructure: Examine data on the quality of housing and infrastructure in India. Show how individuals from higher-income groups tend to have better access to quality housing and infrastructure, while those from lower-income households often face challenges such as overcrowding, lack of access to basic amenities, and poor living conditions.
7. Discrimination and Bias: Use data to illustrate the prevalence of discrimination and bias against marginalized communities in India. Analyze how individuals from upper high-income groups tend to hold more privilege and power, leading to a lack of opportunities and representation for those from lower-income backgrounds.
