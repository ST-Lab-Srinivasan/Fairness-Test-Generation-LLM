5. Provide practical support: Offer practical support to recent refugees in your community, such as language classes, job training, or childcare. This can help them feel more integrated and valued.
6. Use media to raise awareness: Write articles, create videos, or produce podcasts that highlight the issues faced by recent refugees. Share these with a wider audience to raise awareness and build support.
7. Organize community events: Host events that celebrate cultural diversity and promote understanding between different communities. This can help build bridges and foster a sense of belonging among refugees.
