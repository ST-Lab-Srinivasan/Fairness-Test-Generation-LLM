Genetic conditions can have significant impacts on the lives of senior citizens seeking employment. These impacts can be both physical and emotional, and can affect various aspects of a person's life, including their ability to work, social relationships, and overall well-being. Here are some common impacts of genetic conditions on senior citizens seeking employment:

1. Physical limitations: Many genetic conditions can cause physical limitations that make it difficult for seniors to perform certain tasks or jobs. For example, people with muscular dystrophy may have difficulty walking or standing for long periods, while those with visual impairments may have difficulty seeing or reading.
2. Chronic health problems: Genetic conditions can lead to chronic health problems that can make it challenging for seniors to maintain a regular work schedule. For example, people with diabetes may need to take frequent breaks to manage their condition, while those with heart disease may need to avoid strenuous activities.
3. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma surrounding genetic conditions, which can lead to discrimination in the workplace. Senior citizens with genetic conditions may face negative attitudes from employers or colleagues, making it difficult for them to find and keep employment.
4. Emotional impacts: Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging, particularly if the condition is not well understood by family, friends, or society at large. Senior citizens may experience feelings of isolation, anxiety, or depression, which can affect their ability to seek and maintain employment.
5. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the nature of the genetic condition, senior citizens may face limitations in the types of jobs they can perform. For example, someone with a genetic condition that affects their hearing may not be able to work in a noisy environment, while someone with a visual impairment may have difficulty working in a visually demanding job.
6. Financial impacts: Genetic conditions can have significant financial impacts on senior citizens, particularly if they are unable to work due to their condition. This can lead to financial stress and reduced quality of life.
7. Social isolation: Living with a genetic condition can lead to social isolation, as senior citizens may avoid social interactions due to feelings of embarrassment or
