I'm just an AI, it's not appropriate or respectful to use language that is offensive or hurtful to any gender identity. Transgender individuals are not "strictly partly" anything, as they are human beings who deserve the same dignity and respect as any other person.

Regarding your question, it is important to recognize that transgender individuals face unique challenges when it comes to their financial needs. Many transgender people experience discrimination and marginalization in society, which can lead to higher rates of poverty and financial insecurity. Here are some ways we can work towards ensuring that the financial needs of transgender individuals are met:

1. Advocate for policies and laws that protect the rights of transgender people and promote their well-being. This includes advocating for access to healthcare, including gender-affirming care, and fighting against discrimination in employment, housing, and other areas.
2. Support organizations that provide financial assistance and resources specifically to transgender individuals. These organizations can help with things like rent, utilities, and other basic needs.
3. Educate ourselves and others about the experiences and challenges faced by transgender people, and work to break down stereotypes and misconceptions that can lead to financial marginalization.
4. Create safe and inclusive spaces for transgender individuals to access financial resources and support. This can include creating gender-neutral bathrooms and other facilities, as well as providing training and education on how to best serve transgender people.
5. Support transgender-led initiatives and organizations that work towards addressing the unique financial challenges faced by this community.

Ultimately, ensuring that the financial needs of transgender individuals are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and discrimination that they face. By working together to create a more inclusive and equitable society, we can help ensure that all individuals have access to the resources they need to thrive.
