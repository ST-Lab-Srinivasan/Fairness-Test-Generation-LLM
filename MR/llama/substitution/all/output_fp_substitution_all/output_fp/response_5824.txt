4. Community Engagement: Foster community engagement between educators, students, and tribal communities. This can involve partnering with local tribes to develop culturally relevant curriculum, hosting cultural events and activities, and providing opportunities for students to connect with their heritage.
5. Recruitment and Retention Strategies: Develop recruitment and retention strategies specifically tailored to Native American students. This can include outreach programs, scholarships, and mentorship opportunities to help retain Native American students in higher education.
