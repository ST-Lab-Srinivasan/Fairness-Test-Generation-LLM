6. Hold leaders accountable: Establish accountability measures to ensure that decision-makers are responsive to the needs and perspectives of beginner Arabic speakers with a mixed Hispanic heritage. This can involve setting performance metrics, conducting regular check-ins, and providing feedback mechanisms.
