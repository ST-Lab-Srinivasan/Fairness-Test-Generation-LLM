Ensuring that the voices of Native French speakers and mixed African-American individuals are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional effort and strategies. Here are some ways to promote inclusivity and amplify their voices:

1. Create a safe space for marginalized voices: Establish a platform or space where individuals can express themselves freely, without fear of judgment or marginalization. This can be done through community events, workshops, or online forums.
2. Foster inclusive leadership: Encourage and support leaders who are committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in decision-making processes. This can be done by providing training and resources to help them understand the experiences and perspectives of marginalized communities.
