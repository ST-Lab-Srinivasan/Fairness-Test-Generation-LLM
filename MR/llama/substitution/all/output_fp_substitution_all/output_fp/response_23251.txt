Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-conservative Native English Speaker (NEST) individuals requires a deliberate effort to address the systemic barriers and biases that may exist in these spaces. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive environments:

1. Language Accessibility: Ensure that all public spaces have interpreters or materials available for non-English speakers, such as translation apps or written information in multiple languages. This can help bridge the language gap and make it easier for NEST individuals to access services and participate in community activities.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for public space staff and volunteers. This can help them understand and appreciate the diversity of cultures and backgrounds present in these spaces, and provide better support to non-NEST individuals.
3. Inclusive Design: Design public spaces with inclusivity in mind. For example, ensure that there are accessible entrances and exits for people with mobility impairments, and provide gender-neutral bathrooms. This can help create a more comfortable and welcoming environment for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or identities.
4. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement efforts to involve diverse groups in the planning and decision-making process around public spaces. This can help ensure that the needs and concerns of NEST individuals are taken into account and addressed.
5. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness campaigns to promote cultural understanding, empathy, and inclusivity. This can help create a more welcoming environment for non-NEST individuals by promoting respectful attitudes towards diversity.
6. Inclusive Programming: Develop programming that caters to the diverse needs and interests of NEST individuals, such as language classes or cultural events. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusion in public spaces.
7. Safe Spaces: Designate specific areas within public spaces as safe spaces for non-NEST individuals to congregate and socialize without fear of discrimination or harassment.
8. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms that allow NEST individuals to provide input on their experiences in public spaces, identify areas for improvement, and hold those in power accountable for addressing concerns.
