Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers who are ethnically African American requires careful consideration and sensitivity towards their needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions to make such programs more inclusive:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for program staff and volunteers to help them understand the unique experiences and challenges faced by the African American community. This will enable them to create a safe and welcoming environment for participants.
2. Inclusive Programming: Develop programs that cater to the diverse interests and needs of the African American community, such as cultural events, workshops, and activities that promote self-expression and identity exploration.
3. Representation Matters: Ensure that the program's staff, volunteers, and participants reflect the diversity of the African American community. This can be achieved by actively seeking out individuals from different backgrounds and experiences.
4. Safe Space: Create a safe space for participants to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be achieved by setting clear expectations and guidelines for behavior and communication, and providing a supportive and non-judgmental environment.

10. Continuous Improvement: Regularly assess and evaluate the program'
