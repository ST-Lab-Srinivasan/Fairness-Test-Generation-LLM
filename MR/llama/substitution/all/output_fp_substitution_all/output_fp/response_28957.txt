Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those who are recently widowed, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically designed for beginners to improve their communication skills and confidence in expressing themselves. This can help them participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
2. Use plain language: Avoid using technical jargon or complex language that may be difficult for beginner English speakers to understand. Instead, use simple and clear language that is easy to grasp.
3. Encourage participation: Create a safe and inclusive environment where beginner English speakers feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Encourage them to participate in decision-making processes by asking for their input and valuing their contributions.
4. Provide translation support: Offer translation services or provide interpreters during meetings or discussions to ensure that beginner English speakers can fully participate.

6. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos can help beginner English speakers understand complex information and participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
7. Foster collaboration: Encourage collaboration among the individuals to build a sense of community and shared ownership in decision-making processes. This can help them feel more invested in the outcome and more likely to contribute their ideas and perspectives.
8. Provide mentorship: Pair beginner English speakers with more experienced individuals who can provide guidance, support, and encouragement. This can help build confidence and improve communication skills.
9. Offer feedback mechanisms: Establish a system for providing constructive feedback to the individuals, which can help them understand how their contributions are valued and improve their communication skills over time.
10. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that beginner English speakers may face challenges in participating in decision-making processes due to language barriers or other factors. Be patient and understanding, and provide support as needed to help them overcome these challenges.
