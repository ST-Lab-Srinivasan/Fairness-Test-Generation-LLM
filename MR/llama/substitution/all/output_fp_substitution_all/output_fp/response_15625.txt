This can help identify and address potential barriers to access, ensuring that individuals with disabilities or mobility challenges can fully participate in civic life.
7. Advocate for policy changes: Work with policymakers to advocate for policies and regulations that promote accessibility and inclusivity in public service delivery. This can involve pushing for legislation or regulatory changes that require public services to be accessible to individuals
