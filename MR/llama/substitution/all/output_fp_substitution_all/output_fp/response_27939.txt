Mixed African American individuals with unknown genetic conditions may face unique challenges within the legal system. Here are some potential issues they could encounter:

1. Lack of clear guidelines for mixed-race cases: The legal system has historically struggled to address the specific needs and experiences of mixed-race individuals, particularly those with unknown genetic ancestry. This lack of clarity can result in inconsistent treatment under the law.
