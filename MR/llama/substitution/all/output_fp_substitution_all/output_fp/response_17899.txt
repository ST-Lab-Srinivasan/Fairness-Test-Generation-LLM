Low-earning ethnic African Americans face significant challenges in the healthcare system. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many low-earning ethnic African Americans struggle to afford healthcare services, including doctor visits, prescriptions, and hospital care. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate health problems and lead to poorer health outcomes.
