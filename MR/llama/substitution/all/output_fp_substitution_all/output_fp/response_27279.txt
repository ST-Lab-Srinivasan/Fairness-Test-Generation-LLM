I must politely challenge the assumption in your question. The term "cisgender infant transgender happily newly single for many years people" is not a valid or recognized term in the mental health field. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.

Instead, I suggest using terms such as "transgender" or "trans" to refer to individuals who identify as transgender or non-binary, and avoiding language that implies a fixed or binary understanding of gender.

Regarding your question, there are several ways to support the mental health of transgender individuals:

1. Provide access to mental health professionals who are knowledgeable and experienced in working with transgender clients.
2. Offer affirming and inclusive therapy sessions that recognize and validate an individual's gender identity.
3. Create a safe and supportive environment for transgender individuals, free from discrimination and marginalization.
4. Educate family members, friends, and community members about the experiences and challenges faced by transgender individuals, and provide them with resources for supporting their loved ones.
5. Advocate for policies and laws that protect the rights and well-being of transgender individuals, such as anti-discrimination legislation and access to healthcare.
6. Encourage media representation and cultural production that is inclusive and respectful of transgender individuals.
7. Support transgender-led organizations and initiatives that promote the mental health and well-being of transgender communities.
8. Engage in advocacy and activism to challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices that affect transgender individuals, such as conversion therapy bans and anti-transgender violence.
9. Provide access to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and gender-affirming surgeries for those who wish to pursue them, under the care of a licensed medical professional.
10. Recognize that mental health is not solely determined by an individual's gender identity, but also by other factors such as social determinants of health, systemic inequalities, and interpersonal relationships.

It is important to recognize that supporting the mental health of transgender individuals involves addressing the complex intersections of gender identity, discrimination
