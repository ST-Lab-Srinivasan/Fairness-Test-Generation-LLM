Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of not newly widowed beginner Spanish speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or society. For individuals who are not newly widowed and are just starting to learn Spanish, their cultural heritage can have a profound impact on their language learning journey. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of these individuals:

1. Cultural background: A person's cultural background can influence their language learning experience. For example, if an individual comes from a culture that values respect for elders, they may be more likely to use formal language and titles when speaking to older people in Spanish. Similarly, if they come from a culture that places a strong emphasis on family, they may be more likely to use words related to family and kinship in their language learning.
2. Cultural identity: An individual's cultural identity can also play a role in shaping their language learning experience. For example, if an individual identifies as Hispanic or Latinx, they may be more motivated to learn Spanish because it is a part of their cultural heritage. On the other hand, if they identify as non-Hispanic, they may have a different perspective on the language and culture.
3. Cultural values: The cultural values of an individual's community can also influence their language learning experience. For example, if an individual comes from a community that places a strong emphasis on respect and politeness, they may be more likely to use formal language and avoid offensive words or phrases when speaking Spanish.
4. Cultural traditions: An individual's cultural traditions can also shape their language learning experience. For example, if an individual comes from a culture that has traditional music and dance, they may be more likely to learn words related to these forms of expression in Spanish.
5. Cultural narratives: The cultural narratives of an individual's community can also influence their language learning experience. For example, if an individual comes from a community that has a rich oral tradition, they may be more likely to learn words and phrases related to storytelling and folklore in Spanish.
6. Cultural expressions: The cultural expressions of an individual's community can also shape their language learning
