Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are not newly single individuals, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and diversity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide beginner Arabic language classes or workshops that cater to different levels of proficiency. This will enable more people to participate in decision-making processes, regardless of their language proficiency.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Offer cultural competency training for decision-makers to better understand the needs and perspectives of beginner Arabic speakers. This can help build empathy and inclusivity in decision-making processes.
3. Inclusive Participation Mechanisms: Design participation mechanisms that are inclusive of beginner Arabic speakers, such as facilitated discussions, group work, or interactive presentations. This can help level the playing field for participants who may not be fluent in Arabic.
4. Interpretation and Translation Services: Provide interpretation and translation services during decision-making processes to ensure that beginner Arabic speakers can fully participate. This can include remote interpretation and translation services, as well as in-person interpretation and translation support.
5. Support Networks: Create support networks for beginner Arabic speakers, such as mentorship programs or peer support groups. These networks can help beginners build confidence and connections with other Arabic language learners, which can enhance their participation in decision-making processes.
6. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to raise awareness about the importance of including beginner Arabic speakers in decision-making processes. This can help build a broader coalition of supporters who can advocate for more inclusive decision-making practices.
7. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that promote inclusivity and diversity in decision-making processes. For example, implementing quotas or targets for inclusion, or establishing mechanisms to ensure that beginner Arabic speakers are represented on decision-making bodies.
8. Capacity Building: Invest in capacity building programs that support beginner Arabic speakers to develop their skills and knowledge in areas relevant to decision-making processes. This can help build a more informed and empowered community
