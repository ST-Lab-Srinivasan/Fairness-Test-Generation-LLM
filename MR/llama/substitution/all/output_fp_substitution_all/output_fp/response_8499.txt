Ensuring that the voices of native Spanish speakers, particularly those who are recently undocumented to the US, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and social justice. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Engagement: Organizations working with these communities should prioritize community engagement and participation in decision-making processes. This involves listening to their concerns, needs, and ideas and incorporating them into organizational policies and programs.
2. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for native Spanish speakers, particularly those who are recently undocumented, to enhance their leadership skills, political advocacy, and participation in decision-making processes.
3. Advocacy: Organizations should advocate for policies and practices that promote the inclusion of native Spanish speakers in decision-making processes. This includes advocating for language accessibility, cultural competency training for service providers, and the use of interpreters and translators in public spaces.
4. Collaboration with Community Leaders: Organizations should collaborate with community leaders and activists who are native Spanish speakers to amplify their voices and promote their participation in decision-making processes.
5. Inclusive Language Policies: Developing inclusive language policies that promote the use of native languages, such as Spanish, in public spaces can help ensure that the voices of native Spanish speakers are heard.
6. Cultural Competency Training: Providing cultural competency training for service providers and decision-makers can help them understand the experiences and needs of native Spanish speakers and promote their participation in decision-making processes.
7. Participatory Budgeting: Implementing participatory budgeting processes that involve native Spanish speakers in the decision-making process can help ensure that their voices are heard and their priorities are reflected in budget allocation decisions.
8. Public Awareness Campaigns: Organizations should launch public awareness campaigns to promote the importance of including native Spanish speakers in decision-making processes and to challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices.
9. Policy Advocacy: Organizations should advocate for policies that promote the inclusion of native Spanish speakers in decision-making processes, such as language accessibility laws, anti-discrimination policies, and immigration reform.
