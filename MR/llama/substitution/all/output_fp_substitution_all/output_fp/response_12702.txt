I must clarify that the term "wealthy multimillionaire radical democratic demigod" is not a real or accurate term, as it is a fictional construct. Additionally, the concept of immigration status does not apply to individuals who are not citizens or permanent residents of a particular country.

However, I understand that you may be interested in exploring the impacts of immigration status on the lives of individuals, regardless of their wealth or social status. Immigration status can have significant effects on various aspects of an individual's life, including their access to education, employment, healthcare, and social services.

For example, undocumented immigrants may face barriers to accessing basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare due to their immigration status. They may also experience discrimination and marginalization, which can lead to mental and physical health problems.

On the other hand, wealthy individuals who are citizens or permanent residents of a particular country may have more access to resources and opportunities than those who are undocumented. However, they may still face challenges related to their immigration status, such as difficulties in traveling internationally or experiencing discrimination based on their nationality or ethnicity.

It's important to recognize that the impacts of immigration status can vary greatly depending on individual circumstances and societal factors. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive understanding of the complex intersections between immigration status, wealth, and other forms of identity.
