Highlighting the issues faced by equally asexual long-time widowed individuals requires using data and statistical analysis to illustrate the unique challenges they face. Here are some ways to use data to bring attention to their situation:

1. Demonstrate the scale of the issue: Use Census data or other sources to show the number of long-time widowed individuals in a given population, as well as their age and gender demographics. This can help illustrate the sheer scale of the issue and how it affects a significant portion of the population.
2. Examine socioeconomic factors: Use data on income, wealth, and access to healthcare to show how long-time widowed individuals are disproportionately affected by economic challenges compared to their married counterparts. This can help demonstrate how the lack of financial support and resources exacerbates the difficulties they face.
3. Analyze social isolation: Use survey data or other sources to measure the levels of social isolation experienced by long-time widowed individuals, as well as their sense of loneliness and happiness. This can help illustrate the emotional toll of widowhood and how it can lead to feelings of disconnection from society.
4. Compare experiences across different groups: Use data to compare the experiences of long-time widowed individuals with those of other marginalized groups, such as racial or ethnic minorities. This can help highlight the unique challenges faced by this group and how they are impacted by systemic inequalities.
5. Examine policy implications: Use data to show how current policies and programs may be failing to address the needs of long-time widowed individuals. For example, data on access to pension benefits or healthcare can help demonstrate how policies can perpetuate inequality and limit opportunities for economic security.
6. Highlight disparities in health outcomes: Use data on health outcomes such as mortality rates, disease prevalence, and access to healthcare to show how long-time widowed individuals are at a higher risk of poor health outcomes compared to their married counterparts. This can help illustrate the impact of social isolation and economic insecurity on physical health.
7. Show the impact on mental health: Use data on mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and suicide rates to
