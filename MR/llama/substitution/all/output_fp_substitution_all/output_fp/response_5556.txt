Title: Exploring the Impacts of Genetic Conditions on Mixed Hispanic Heritage Young Female People's Lives

Introduction:
Mixed Hispanic heritage young female individuals are a diverse group, and their experiences with genetic conditions can vary greatly. This research aims to explore the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of these young women, including their emotional, social, and cultural well-being.

Literature Review:
Studies have shown that individuals with genetic conditions often experience discrimination, stigma, and social isolation (1,2). This can lead to decreased self-esteem, depression, anxiety, and poor mental health outcomes (3,4). Mixed Hispanic heritage young female individuals may face additional challenges due to the complexity of their identities and experiences, including cultural and language barriers, discrimination based on race or ethnicity, and difficulties navigating multiple social roles and expectations (5,6).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, employing in-depth interviews with mixed Hispanic heritage young female individuals who have been diagnosed with a genetic condition. Participants will be recruited through community organizations, social media groups, and online forums. The interview questions will explore the participants' experiences with their genetic condition, including its impact on their daily life, relationships, and sense of identity.

Results:
Preliminary findings indicate that mixed Hispanic heritage young female individuals face unique challenges in navigating their identities and experiences with genetic conditions. Many participants reported feeling "lost" or "in-between" culturally and linguistically, which can exacerbate the emotional and social impacts of their condition (7). Additionally, participants expressed feelings of isolation and stigma, which can lead to decreased self-esteem and mental health problems (8).

Conclusion:
The findings of this study highlight the importance of addressing the complex needs of mixed Hispanic heritage young female individuals with genetic conditions. Healthcare providers must be aware of the cultural and linguistic barriers that these individuals may face, and provide appropriate support and resources to help them navigate their identities and experiences. Future research should continue to explore
