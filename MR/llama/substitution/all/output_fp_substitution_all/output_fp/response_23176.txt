Just above poverty line mixed African American people face several challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they encounter:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: Despite being above the poverty line, these individuals may still struggle to access quality healthcare due to various barriers such as lack of insurance coverage, high out-of-pocket costs, and limited availability of providers in their area.
2. Discrimination and bias: Mixed race individuals may face discrimination and bias within the healthcare system, which can result in delayed or inadequate care. Studies have shown that patients of color often experience poorer quality of care and lower satisfaction with their medical encounters compared to white patients.
3. Cultural competency issues: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained in culturally competent care for mixed race individuals, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnosis based on cultural differences.
4. Lack of representation in clinical trials: Mixed race individuals are underrepresented in clinical trials, which can result in a lack of relevant research and treatment options tailored to their specific needs.
5. Stigma and shame: Mixed race individuals may internalize the stigma and shame associated with being mixed race, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
6. Difficulty navigating identity: Mixed race individuals may struggle with navigating their multiple identities and feeling a sense of belonging within any one community or cultural group.
7. Limited access to genetic testing: Due to the complex nature of mixed race ancestry, some individuals may face challenges in accessing genetic testing and understanding their genetic health risks.
8. Inadequate pain management: Mixed race individuals may experience inadequate pain management due to assumptions about their racial or ethnic background.
9. Limited availability of culturally sensitive services: Some mixed race individuals may not have access to culturally sensitive services, such as language interpretation or cultural competency training for healthcare providers.
10. Difficulty advocating for self-care: Mixed race individuals may face challenges in advocating for their own health and wellness due to internalized oppression or lack of representation in the healthcare system.
