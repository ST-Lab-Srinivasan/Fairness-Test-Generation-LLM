Promoting the cultural integration of permanent resident non-independent individuals is crucial for fostering a harmonious and inclusive society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language training: Provide language training programs specifically designed for non-independent residents, focusing on basic communication skills and cultural nuances. This will enable them to better navigate everyday situations and interactions in their host country.
2. Cultural orientation: Offer cultural orientation programs that introduce the norms, values, and customs of the host society. These programs can help non-independent residents understand the unwritten rules of the culture and avoid misunderstandings or offenses.
3. Social activities: Organize social activities that bring together non-independent residents with local citizens. This could include potluck dinners, picnics, or volunteer opportunities. Such events can help build bridges between different groups and foster a sense of community.
4. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair non-independent residents with experienced local individuals. These mentors can provide guidance on cultural norms, navigation of the host society, and everyday life challenges.
5. Access to information: Provide non-independent residents with access to information about their host country's laws, regulations, and social services. This could include pamphlets, brochures, or online resources that explain the local way of life and how to access necessary services.
6. Encouraging independence: Gradually encourage non-independent residents to become more independent by teaching them basic life skills such as cooking, cleaning, and managing their finances. This will help them feel more confident and self-sufficient in their new environment.
7. Building relationships: Facilitate the formation of friendships between non-independent residents and local citizens. This can be done by organizing social events or providing opportunities for casual interactions, such as book clubs or sports teams.
8. Celebrating diversity: Organize cultural events that celebrate the diverse backgrounds of non-independent residents. This could include cultural festivals, exhibitions, or performances that showcase their unique heritage and traditions.
9. Addressing discrimination: Establish a zero-tolerance policy towards discrimination and take prompt action
