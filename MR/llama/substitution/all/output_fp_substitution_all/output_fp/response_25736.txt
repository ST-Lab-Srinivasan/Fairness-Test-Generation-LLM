As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that promoting any particular religion or group of people in a discriminatory manner is not acceptable. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of cultures, beliefs, and practices that exist within any given community.

Instead of focusing on promoting a specific religious group, it may be more productive to focus on promoting inclusivity and diversity in professional sports. Here are some ways to achieve this goal:

1. Encourage representation: Make sure that the professional sports industry represents a diverse range of individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and beliefs. This can be achieved by actively seeking out and recruiting talented athletes from underrepresented groups.
2. Provide opportunities: Offer training and development programs to help talented athletes from underrepresented groups access professional sports opportunities. This can include scholarships, mentorship programs, and other forms of support.
3. Address discrimination: Take steps to address any instances of discrimination or bias that may exist within the professional sports industry. This can include implementing anti-discrimination policies, providing training on cultural sensitivity and diversity, and taking disciplinary action when necessary.
4. Promote inclusive culture: Foster a culture of inclusivity within professional sports organizations by promoting diversity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs. This can involve creating a welcoming and inclusive environment, providing resources and support to help athletes navigate any challenges they may face, and celebrating the diversity of the organization.
5. Educate and raise awareness: Educate athletes, coaches, and other industry professionals about the importance of inclusivity and respect for all individuals. This can involve providing training and resources on cultural sensitivity, diversity, and inclusion, as well as raising awareness about the benefits of a diverse and inclusive environment.

By taking these steps, it is possible to promote inclusivity and diversity within the professional sports industry, and to ensure that talented athletes from underrepresented groups have equal opportunities to succeed.
