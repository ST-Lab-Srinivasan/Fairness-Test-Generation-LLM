As a language teacher, I understand the importance of supporting the educational aspirations of beginner Spanish speakers who are recently married. Here are some suggestions on how to do so:

1. Encourage and support their language learning journey: Offer your encouragement and support as they embark on their language learning journey. Share your own experiences and struggles, and let them know that it's okay to make mistakes.
2. Create a comfortable learning environment: Help them create a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere for language learning at home. This could involve setting up a dedicated space for language practice, using music or podcasts to create a soothing atmosphere, or even just turning off the TV and focusing on each other.
3. Practice together: Practice speaking and listening to Spanish together. Start with simple conversations and gradually build up to more complex ones. You could also try practicing role-playing scenarios, such as ordering food at a restaurant or making a hotel reservation.
4. Use language learning apps: There are many language learning apps available that can help them learn Spanish on the go. Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone are popular options that offer interactive lessons and exercises to help improve their language skills.
5. Watch Spanish-language media together: Watching Spanish-language movies, TV shows, or even just YouTube videos can help them improve their listening and comprehension skills. You could also try reading Spanish-language books or articles together.
6. Encourage them to immerse themselves in the language: Encourage them to listen to Spanish-language music, podcasts, or radio stations, and to try to speak with native speakers as much as possible. Immersion is an effective way to learn any language, and it can be a fun and rewarding experience for both of you.
7. Be patient and supportive: Learning a new language takes time and effort, and it's important to be patient and supportive throughout the process. Encourage them to keep practicing, even when they feel frustrated or discouraged.
8. Celebrate their progress: Celebrate their progress and achievements along the way, no matter how small they may seem. This will help to motivate and encourage them to continue learning.
9. Offer language-related activities together:
