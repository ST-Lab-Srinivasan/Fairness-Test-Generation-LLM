The impact of disability status on the lives of non-citizen individuals who have not been married for a long time can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Non-citizens with disabilities may face social isolation, as they may encounter discrimination or stigma in their communities. This can limit their opportunities for social interaction and connection, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Non-citizens with disabilities may face barriers to accessing education and employment opportunities due to discrimination or lack of accommodations. This can limit their ability to improve their socio-economic status and achieve financial stability.
3. Healthcare disparities: Non-citizens with disabilities may experience disparities in healthcare access and quality, particularly if they do not have access to health insurance or face language barriers. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, exacerbating their condition and limiting their ability to manage their symptoms.
4. Lack of representation and advocacy: Non-citizens with disabilities may lack access to representation and advocacy services, particularly if they are not fluent in the dominant language or have limited mobility. This can make it difficult for them to navigate systems and access resources, leading to feelings of powerlessness and marginalization.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Non-citizens with disabilities may face stigma and discrimination based on their immigration status, which can further exacerbate the challenges they already face due to their disability. This can lead to social isolation, low self-esteem, and depression.
6. Limited legal protections: Non-citizens with disabilities may have limited access to legal protections, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which provide rights and protections for individuals with disabilities in the United States. This can limit their ability to advocate for themselves and access necessary accommodations.
7. Financial barriers: Non-citizens with disabilities may face financial barriers to accessing healthcare, education, and employment opportunities due to their immigration status
