3. Language and cultural immersion programs: Provide opportunities for active-duty Native students to learn their indigenous language and participate in cultural immersion programs, which can help them maintain their cultural practices and traditions.
4. Mentorship and support programs: Establish mentorship and support programs that pair active-duty Native students with successful Native role models or mentors, who can provide guidance and encouragement throughout their academic journey.
5. Access to tribal resources: Provide access to tribal resources and services, such as the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), which offers educational opportunities for Native American students on tribal lands.
6. Collaboration with tribal communities: Work closely with local Native American tribes and communities to develop culturally responsive educational programs that meet their specific needs and promote their cultural preservation.
