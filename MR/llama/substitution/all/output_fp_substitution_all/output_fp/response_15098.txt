I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question as it is based on an absurd and nonsensical premise. The concept of "ultra-liberal" people not being in their third trimester of pregnancy is illogical and contradictory, as pregnancy is a biological process that cannot be reversed or avoided. Therefore, it is not possible for someone to be both not in their third trimester of pregnancy and an "ultra-liberal" person at the same time.

Additionally, the legal system does not recognize or differentiate between individuals based on their political beliefs or ideologies. Everyone is entitled to equal protection under the law, regardless of their political views.

I hope this helps clarify things. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask!
