Promoting the educational success of mixed Hispanic heritage non-independent students requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that educators, parents, and communities can use to support these students:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for teachers and staff on culturally responsive teaching practices and how to recognize and address the impact of cultural identity on academic performance.
2. Bilingual Education: Offer bilingual education programs or dual language immersion programs that cater to the student's native language and culture, which can help them feel more connected to their educational environment.
3. Support Groups: Establish support groups for mixed Hispanic heritage students, where they can connect with peers who share similar experiences and challenges. These groups can provide a safe space for students to share their feelings and concerns, and receive emotional support from their peers.
4. Mentorship Programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair mixed Hispanic heritage students with older, successful students or mentors who can serve as role models and provide guidance on academic and personal matters.
5. Family Engagement: Encourage family engagement by providing opportunities for parents to participate in school events, volunteer in the classroom, or attend parent-teacher conferences. This can help build a sense of community and support around the student.
6. Identity-Based Curriculum: Incorporate identity-based curriculum that recognizes and celebrates the diverse cultural backgrounds of mixed Hispanic heritage students. This can help them feel seen, valued, and connected to their educational experience.
7. Teaching Strategies: Use teaching strategies that cater to the individual learning styles and needs of mixed Hispanic heritage students. This may involve using visual aids, hands-on activities, or other techniques that promote active learning and engagement.
8. Access to Resources: Ensure that mixed Hispanic heritage students have access to resources such as computers, libraries, and other academic tools that can help them succeed academically.
9. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that support the educational success of mixed Hispanic heritage students. This may involve working with local and national organizations to promote inclusive education practices.
