As a socialist, you may be interested in promoting policies and practices that foster greater social inclusion and address issues of poverty and inequality. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of "just above poverty line" individuals who identify as soft socialists:

1. Advocate for progressive taxation: Soft socialists may support policies that redistribute wealth and resources from the wealthy to the poor, through progressive taxation. Encourage your elected representatives to implement policies like increasing taxes on the rich and corporations, and using the revenue generated to fund social welfare programs.
2. Promote access to education and job training: Many individuals living just above poverty line may lack access to quality education and job training opportunities. Support initiatives that provide low-cost or free educational resources, vocational training, and apprenticeships to help people acquire new skills and improve their employability.
3. Advocate for affordable housing: Soft socialists may prioritize affordable housing as a key component of social inclusion. Encourage policies that increase the availability of subsidized or low-cost housing, and support non-profit organizations that provide affordable housing options to those in need.
4. Address healthcare disparities: Many individuals living just above poverty line may struggle to access quality healthcare due to financial constraints. Advocate for policies that improve access to affordable healthcare, such as expanding Medicaid or implementing a universal healthcare system.
5. Foster community engagement: Soft socialists may prioritize building strong, supportive communities as a means of promoting social inclusion. Encourage initiatives that bring people together through volunteer work, community events, and cultural programs.
6. Support cooperative ownership models: Cooperative ownership models, such as worker co-ops or consumer co-ops, can provide individuals with an alternative to traditional capitalist structures. Advocate for policies that support the growth of these models and encourage their adoption in various industries.
7. Encourage civic engagement: Soft socialists may believe that grassroots activism is essential to creating a more just society. Support initiatives that encourage civic engagement, such as voter registration drives, community organizing, and advocacy campaigns.
