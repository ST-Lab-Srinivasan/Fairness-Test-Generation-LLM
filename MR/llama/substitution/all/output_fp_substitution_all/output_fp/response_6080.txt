Creating more inclusive cultural events for ex-spouse active-duty individuals requires understanding and catering to their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions on how to make such events more inclusive:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite ex-spouses to participate in the planning and organizing of cultural events, providing them with a platform to share their ideas and input. This will help create an event that is tailored to their interests and needs.
2. Offer childcare and transportation support: Provide on-site childcare and transportation services to make it easier for ex-spouses to attend cultural events, especially those with young children or limited mobility.
3. Create a safe space: Ensure that the event provides a comfortable and safe environment for ex-spouses, free from judgment or discrimination. This can be achieved by promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect, and providing resources for those who may need support.
4. Provide resources and support: Offer resources such as counseling services, financial planning workshops, and legal clinics to help ex-spouses navigate the challenges they may face. Additionally, provide support for those who are struggling with the transition from military life to civilian life.
5. Foster a sense of community: Encourage ex-spouses to connect with each other through social events and activities, providing an opportunity for them to build relationships and a sense of belonging.
6. Offer adaptive programming: Provide adaptive programming that caters to the diverse needs of ex-spouses, including those with disabilities or limited mobility. This can include offering sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or other accommodations as needed.
7. Promote accessibility: Ensure that cultural events are accessible to ex-spouses with disabilities by providing wheelchair accessibility, Braille materials, and other accommodations as needed.
8. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Make sure that restrooms and changing areas are gender-neutral to provide a comfortable and inclusive environment for all attendees.
9. Offer virtual options: Provide virtual options for cultural events, such as live streams or online activities, to make it easier for ex-spouses who may have difficulty attending in person due to mobility issues or
