Individuals in their late 30s, particularly those who are natural-born citizens, may face various challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Perception of age: Many employers may view individuals in their late 30s as being too old or past their prime, which can limit their job opportunities.
2. Limited career advancement: As people age, they may find it more difficult to advance in their careers due to a lack of opportunities or the perception that they are no longer valuable assets to the organization.
3. Skills obsolescence: With the rapid pace of technological change, individuals in their late 30s may find that their skills become less relevant or obsolete, making it harder for them to compete in the job market.
4. Health issues: As people age, they may experience a decline in physical or mental health, which can impact their ability to perform tasks and meet job expectations.
5. Family responsibilities: Many individuals in their late 30s may have family obligations, such as caring for children or aging parents, which can limit their availability for work or impact their ability to commit to long hours or demanding jobs.
6. Stereotyping and bias: Unfortunately, there is still a prevalent stereotype that older workers are less productive or less capable than their younger counterparts. This can lead to discrimination and bias in the hiring process.
7. Limited job opportunities: In some industries or regions, there may be limited job opportunities for individuals in their late 30s, particularly if they are not well-connected or do not have a strong network of contacts.
8. Burnout: With increased responsibilities and stress at work, individuals in their late 30s may experience burnout, which can impact their productivity and job satisfaction.
9. Lack of flexibility: As people age, they may find it more difficult to adapt to changing work schedules or work arrangements, which can limit their job opportunities.
10. Stigma of older workers: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to older workers in some cultures or industries, which can impact their ability to find employment or advance in their careers.
