1. Pregnancy discrimination: Unfortunately, pregnant employees are still vulnerable to discrimination in the workplace. They may be passed over for promotions or have their workloads reduced due to their pregnancy status.
2. Accommodation challenges: As their pregnancy advances, some employees may require additional accommodations, such as frequent breaks, elevated seating, or job modifications, which can be difficult to navigate in the legal system.
3. Leave entitlements: Pregnant employees may be entitled to certain leave rights under the relevant legislation, but navigating these entitlements and ensuring that they receive the correct amount of leave can be challenging.
4. Workplace safety concerns: Employees in their third trimester may face safety concerns in the workplace, such as lifting restrictions or exposure to hazardous materials, which can lead to legal disputes if not addressed adequately.
5. Lack of awareness and support: Some employers may be unaware of the legal rights and responsibilities surrounding pregnant employees, leading to a lack of support and accommodations for expecting mothers.
6. Fear of stigma: Pregnant employees may fear being stigmatized or judged in the workplace, which can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
7. Difficulty balancing work and pregnancy: As their pregnancy advances, some employees may find it challenging to balance their work responsibilities with their growing needs and limitations during their third trimester.
8. Limited career progression: Pregnant employees may feel that they are at a disadvantage in terms of career progression due to their pregnancy status, leading to feelings of frustration and disillusionment.
9. Inadequate maternity leave: Employees may face challenges in securing adequate maternity leave, which can impact their well-being and ability to care for their newborn.
