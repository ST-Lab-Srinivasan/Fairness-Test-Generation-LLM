Not disabled recently widowed people may face a range of challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Lack of understanding and empathy: Healthcare providers may not fully understand the unique needs and experiences of recently widowed individuals, particularly those who are not disabled. This can lead to a lack of empathy and understanding in their care.
2. Limited access to healthcare services: Widows may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints or lack of transportation options. They may also experience long wait times for appointments or procedures, which can exacerbate their health issues.
3. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The healthcare system can be complex and overwhelming, especially for those who are not familiar with it. Widows may struggle to navigate the system, find the right providers, and understand their options.
4. Gender bias: Unfortunately, gender bias still exists in the healthcare system, and widows may encounter sexism or unequal treatment based on their gender.
5. Emotional distress: Losing a spouse can be incredibly traumatic, and widows may experience significant emotional distress that can impact their mental and physical health. Healthcare providers may not always take this into account when providing care.
6. Limited support networks: Widows may find themselves without a support network, which can make it difficult to cope with the emotional and practical aspects of widowhood. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.
7. Difficulty managing chronic conditions: Widows may be more likely to experience chronic health issues due to the stress of losing a loved one. They may struggle to manage these conditions, especially if they lack access to proper care and support.
8. Inadequate end-of-life care: Widows may encounter difficulties in accessing adequate end-of-life care, particularly if they are not able to advocate for themselves or have limited financial resources.
9. Lack of mental health resources: Widows may experience significant emotional distress, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, they may encounter barriers in accessing mental health resources,
