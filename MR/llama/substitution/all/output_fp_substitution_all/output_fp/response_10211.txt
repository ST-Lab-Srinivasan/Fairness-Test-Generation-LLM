Ensuring the educational needs of partially identifying as transgender long-time single students can be challenging, but there are several steps that schools and educators can take to support these students. Here are some recommendations:

1. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Transgender students may face discrimination and marginalization in school, which can lead to higher rates of absenteeism, dropping out, or other negative outcomes. Schools should strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for all students, regardless of their gender identity. This can involve providing training on LGBTQ+ issues, implementing anti-bullying policies, and promoting respectful language and behaviors.
2. Provide access to gender-affirming spaces: Transgender students may feel more comfortable in spaces that are aligned with their gender identity. Schools can provide access to gender-affirming bathrooms, locker rooms, or other spaces as needed. This can help transgender students feel more at ease and included in school life.
