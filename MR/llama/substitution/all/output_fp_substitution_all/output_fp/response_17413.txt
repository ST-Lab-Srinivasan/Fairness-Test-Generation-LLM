Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed Asian Heritage Liberal Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those with mixed Asian heritage. This group faces unique challenges in navigating multiple cultures and identities, which can impact their sense of self and belonging. Through a qualitative research approach, this study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of mixed Asian heritage liberal individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity in various ways. For instance, it can provide a sense of belonging and connection to one's roots (Hall, 1992), or it can create feelings of confusion and fragmentation when individuals encounter conflicting values and beliefs across different cultures (Girma & Ayele, 2015).

Participants were recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling, ensuring a diverse range of ages, genders, and cultural backgrounds. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for a detailed analysis of participants' experiences and perspectives.

2. Conflicting cultural values: Mixed Asian heritage individuals often encounter conflicting values and beliefs across different cultures, leading to a sense of confusion or disorientation. This was particularly evident when participants encountered cultural practices or values that conflicted with their
