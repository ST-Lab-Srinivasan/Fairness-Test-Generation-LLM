Creating more inclusive community events for beginner English speakers from lower-class backgrounds requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services, such as simultaneous interpreting, live captioning, or pre-recorded audio descriptions, to help non-English speakers follow the event.
2. Use simple language: Avoid using complex vocabulary or jargon that may be unfamiliar to your audience. Use clear and concise language that is easy to understand for beginners.
3. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide training for staff and volunteers on cultural sensitivity and how to interact with people from diverse backgrounds. This can help create a more inclusive environment.
4. Promote accessibility: Ensure that your event location is wheelchair accessible, has accessible restrooms, and is located near public transportation stops. Provide additional accommodations such as Braille signage or audio descriptions for attendees with visual impairments.
5. Recruit diverse participants: Actively seek out participants from different backgrounds and communities to ensure a diverse representation of voices and experiences. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and encourage lower-class people to feel more comfortable participating.
6. Offer childcare and transportation: Provide free or low-cost childcare and transportation options to make it easier for attendees who may not have access to these resources otherwise. This can help remove barriers to participation.
7. Create a safe space: Establish a code of conduct that promotes respect, inclusivity, and empathy. Encourage attendees to speak up if they witness any form of harassment or discrimination.
8. Offer flexible participation options: Allow attendees to participate in the event through various channels, such as online streaming, video conferencing, or social media engagement. This can help lower-class people who may not have access to physical locations due to financial constraints or mobility issues.
9. Provide free resources: Offer free materials, such as workbooks, pamphlets, or other educational resources, that can help attendees learn and engage with the topic more effectively
