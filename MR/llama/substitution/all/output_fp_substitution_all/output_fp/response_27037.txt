Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent undocumented immigrants in education requires a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

This can involve incorporating traditional teachings and practices into the classroom, such as using storytelling and oral tradition to convey knowledge.

This can involve incorporating indigenous knowledge and practices into the curriculum and creating a safe and inclusive learning environment.
6. Leadership development: Develop leadership opportunities for Native American students, such as mentorship programs, student government, or extracurricular activities. This can help build confidence, skills, and cultural identity.
7. Family engagement: Engage with Native American families to provide support and resources that promote academic success and cultural continuity. This can involve offering parenting workshops, providing food and transportation assistance, and creating opportunities for family involvement in the educational process.
