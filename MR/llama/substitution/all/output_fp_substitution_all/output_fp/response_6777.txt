Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper middle-income, non-single individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects of their lives. Here are some recommendations:

1. Affordable Housing: Provide subsidies or tax incentives for affordable housing options, especially for those who are not upper middle-income. This can include rent control policies, infrastructure development for affordable housing, and support for community land trusts.
2. Access to Education and Training: Implement programs that provide access to quality education and job training for non-upper middle-income individuals, including vocational training, apprenticeships, and certification programs. This can help them acquire new skills and increase their earning potential.
3. Healthcare Reform: Strengthen public healthcare systems or implement universal healthcare policies to ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare, regardless of their income level. This can include measures such as expanded Medicaid coverage, subsidies for private insurance, and mental health services.
4. Childcare Support: Provide affordable childcare options, including subsidies for low-income families, tax credits for childcare expenses, and support for community-based childcare programs. This can help reduce the financial burden of raising children and enable parents to pursue employment or education opportunities.
5. Retirement Security: Implement policies that ensure retirement security for non-upper middle-income individuals, such as expanding Social Security benefits, creating auto-enrollment retirement plans, and offering tax incentives for retirement savings.
6. Job Creation and Entrepreneurship: Foster job creation through small businesses and entrepreneurship by providing access to capital, reducing regulatory barriers, and investing in infrastructure and community development. This can help create new opportunities for employment and economic mobility.
7. Community Development: Invest in community development programs that provide support for low-income neighborhoods, including funding for community centers, job training programs, and social services. This can help build stronger, more resilient communities and reduce inequality.
8. Progressive Taxation: Implement a progressive tax system that reduces the burden on low- and moderate-income households while increasing taxes
