Creating more inclusive community events for Nigerian adults in their late 30s can be achieved by considering the following factors:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct research to understand the interests, preferences, and challenges faced by Nigerian adults in their late 30s. This will help you tailor your events to meet their specific needs.
2. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where everyone feels welcome and included. Use inclusive language and imagery in your promotional materials, and make sure that your events are accessible to people with disabilities.
3. Provide opportunities for meaningful engagement: Offer activities and discussions that allow attendees to connect with each other and the community. This could include workshops, panel discussions, or volunteer opportunities.
4. Promote diversity and representation: Ensure that your events feature diverse speakers, performers, and attendees. Use inclusive marketing materials and messaging to reach a wider audience.
5. Offer childcare and transportation support: Many working professionals in their late 30s may have families or other commitments that make it difficult for them to attend events without support. Provide childcare services or arrange for transportation to and from the event to make it more accessible.
6. Cater to different learning styles: Offer a variety of engagement formats, such as lectures, workshops, or interactive activities, to cater to different learning styles and preferences.
7. Incorporate technology: Utilize digital platforms and social media to reach a wider audience, provide remote access to events, and facilitate communication among attendees.
8. Foster intergenerational connections: Pair older attendees with younger ones to create opportunities for mentorship and learning. This can help build bridges between different age groups within the community.
9. Provide ample food and drink options: Offer a variety of food and drinks that cater to different dietary preferences and cultural traditions.
10. Encourage community involvement: Create opportunities for attendees to get involved in local initiatives or projects, fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility within the community.
