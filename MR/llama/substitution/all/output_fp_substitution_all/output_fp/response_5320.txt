4. Intergenerational Programming: Offer programs and activities that bring together people of different ages and backgrounds, fostering intergenerational connections and understanding.
5. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural practices and beliefs of older adult Jewish individuals, and provide programming that respects and values their heritage.
