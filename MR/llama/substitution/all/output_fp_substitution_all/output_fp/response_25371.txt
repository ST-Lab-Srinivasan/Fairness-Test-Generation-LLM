Creating more inclusive cultural events for devout Muslim refugee individuals requires understanding and respecting their beliefs, values, and practices. Here are some suggestions to make cultural events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Understand the importance of religion in their lives: Refugees often face challenges related to their religion, including discrimination, marginalization, and social isolation. By understanding the significance of religion in their lives, you can create events that are more inclusive and respectful of their beliefs.
2. Involve them in the planning process: Invite devout Muslim refugees to participate in the planning process for cultural events. This will give them a sense of ownership and agency, and allow them to contribute their perspectives and ideas.
