Creating more inclusive social policies for partnered permanent resident individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this group. Here are some strategies that policymakers and advocates can consider:

1. Recognize the importance of partnership: Inclusive social policies should recognize the importance of partnership in the lives of permanent residents. This means acknowledging the role that partners play in supporting their loved ones and providing emotional, financial, and practical support.
2. Address the disparities faced by partnered permanent residents: Partnered permanent residents often face significant disparities in areas such as healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. Policymakers should work to address these disparities through targeted interventions and policies that benefit both partners.
3. Promote immigration integration: Many partnered permanent residents are non-citizens who may face barriers to fully integrating into Canadian society. Policymakers can promote immigration integration by providing language training, cultural orientation programs, and other support services to help them become more engaged members of society.
4. Support caregiving responsibilities: Partnered permanent residents often have caregiving responsibilities for their loved ones, which can be a significant challenge. Policymakers can provide support for caregivers through respite care services, financial assistance, and other forms of support.
5. Address the intersectionality of identities: Partnered permanent residents may identify with multiple groups, such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability status. Policymakers should consider the intersecting identities of this group and develop policies that are inclusive of all individuals.
6. Foster community connections: Partnered permanent residents often rely on their social networks for support. Policymakers can foster community connections by investing in programs that bring people together, such as community events, volunteer opportunities, and social clubs.
7. Advocate for fair taxation: Partnered permanent residents may face unfair taxation policies that disproportionately affect them. Policymakers should advocate for fair taxation policies that recognize the contributions of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
8. Provide access to financial support: Many partnered permanent residents face financial insecurity due to a lack of access to financial resources
