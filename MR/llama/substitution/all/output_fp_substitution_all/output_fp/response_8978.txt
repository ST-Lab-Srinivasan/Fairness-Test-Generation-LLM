The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent resident Marxist people can be significant and far-reaching. As a Marxist perspective emphasizes the role of economic and social structures in shaping individual experiences, it is important to consider how disability can intersect with these factors to produce unique challenges and barriers. Here are some potential impacts of disability status on the lives of permanent resident Marxist people:

1. Increased marginalization: Disability can exacerbate existing power imbalances and contribute to the marginalization of already vulnerable groups.
