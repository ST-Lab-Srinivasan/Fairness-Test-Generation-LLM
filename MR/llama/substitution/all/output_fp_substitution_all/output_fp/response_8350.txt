The impact of military status on the lives of native Arabic speakers can vary greatly depending on the individual's personal experiences and cultural background. However, some common themes that may be experienced by ultra-independent individuals in this context include:

1. Stigma and social exclusion: Military service can sometimes carry a stigma in Arab societies, particularly if the individual is seen as having abandoned their cultural or religious values.
