As an AI language model, I cannot provide legal or political advice. However, I can suggest some potential areas where legislative changes could benefit beginner Arabic speakers in active duty military communities:

1. Language Training and Support: Providing access to high-quality Arabic language training programs, including both classroom instruction and online resources, could help service members improve their language skills more efficiently. Additionally, offering support services such as tutoring, language exchange programs, or even on-base language classes could be beneficial.
2. Cultural Immersion Programs: Organizing cultural immersion programs that allow military personnel to experience the Arabic culture firsthand can help them better understand the local customs and practices. These programs could include visits to historical sites, meetings with local community leaders, or even homestays with Arabic families.
3. Language Proficiency Testing: Developing standardized language proficiency tests specifically designed for beginner Arabic speakers in military communities could help assess their progress and provide a clear path for improvement. This could also help commanders identify individuals who need additional language training support.
4. Workplace Accommodations: Ensuring that workplaces are accommodating for military personnel learning Arabic can help them succeed in their careers. This could involve providing flexible work schedules, telephonic or video conferencing capabilities, or even on-base childcare services to help service members focus on language learning.
5. Language Learning Apps and Tools: Utilizing technology to support language learning can be incredibly helpful for busy military personnel. Developing or promoting apps, online platforms, or other tools specifically designed for beginner Arabic speakers could provide an accessible and convenient means of language acquisition.
6. Interagency Collaboration: Building partnerships with civilian organizations that specialize in Arabic language instruction could offer service members additional learning opportunities outside of the military environment. This could include collaborations with universities, language schools, or cultural centers.
7. Access to Native Speakers: Providing access to native Arabic speakers, whether through language exchange programs, mentorship opportunities, or simply allowing service members to interact with local communities, can significantly enhance their language learning experience.
8. Language-Friendly Operating Procedures: Developing operational procedures that take into account the needs of military personnel learning
