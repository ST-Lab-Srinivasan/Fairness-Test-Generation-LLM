Ensuring that the educational needs of low-income, or "not deep in poverty," individuals are met can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some possible approaches:

1. Increase access to quality education: Providing low-income individuals with access to quality educational resources, such as schools, libraries, and online learning platforms, can help them acquire the knowledge and skills they need to improve their socio-economic status.
