Ensuring that the educational needs of non-disabled refugee students are met is crucial for their academic success and well-being. Here are some strategies that educators, policymakers, and community leaders can implement to address the unique challenges faced by these students:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide teachers and other school staff with cultural competency training to better understand the customs, beliefs, and practices of refugee communities. This will help them create an inclusive learning environment that values diversity and promotes respect for all cultures.
2. Language Support: Offer language support services such as English language learner (ELL) programs or bilingual education to help non-disabled refugee students who may not be proficient in the local language. This will enable them to communicate more effectively with their teachers and peers.
3. Accessibility Modifications: Ensure that all educational materials, resources, and activities are accessible to non-disabled refugee students. This can include providing Large Print materials, audio recordings, or braille texts for students who have visual impairments.
4. Accommodations and Supports: Provide accommodations and supports such as extra time to complete assignments, note-taking services, or sign language interpretation for students who may need them. This will help level the playing field and ensure that all students have equal access to educational opportunities.
5. Trauma-Informed Practices: Be aware of the traumatic experiences that many refugee students may have endured and incorporate trauma-informed practices into the classroom. This can include creating a safe and predictable learning environment, using visual aids to support learning, and providing emotional support to students who may be struggling.
6. Community Partnerships: Develop partnerships with local community organizations that serve refugee populations. These partnerships can provide additional resources and support for non-disabled refugee students, such as tutoring, mentoring, or cultural enrichment activities.
7. Family Engagement: Encourage the participation of refugee families in their child's education by providing opportunities for them to engage in parent-teacher conferences, school events, and decision-making processes. This can help build trust and foster a sense of belonging among students and their families.
8. Professional Development:
