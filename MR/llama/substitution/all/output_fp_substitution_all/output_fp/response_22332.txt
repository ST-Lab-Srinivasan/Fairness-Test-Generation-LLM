It is important to recognize that the experiences of left-leaning ethnically full African Americans in the healthcare system can vary based on their individual circumstances and background. However, there are some common challenges that this group may face:

1. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained to provide care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including those with different cultural beliefs and practices. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and poorer health outcomes.
2. Implicit bias: Providers may hold unconscious biases that can affect their interactions with patients of color, leading to inadequate care or dismissive treatment. Studies have shown that providers may be less likely to take symptoms seriously when they come from individuals who are perceived as belonging to a marginalized group.
3.
