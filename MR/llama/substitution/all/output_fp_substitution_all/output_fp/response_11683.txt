Ensuring that the educational needs of Native Spanish Speaker (NSS) separated students are met can be challenging, but there are several strategies that educators and schools can implement to support these students. Here are some recommendations:

1. Provide bilingual education: NSS students may require bilingual education to help them succeed academically. This can involve providing instruction in both English and Spanish, depending on the student's proficiency level in each language.
2. Use visual aids and multimedia resources: NSS students may benefit from the use of visual aids and multimedia resources, such as videos, audio recordings, and interactive presentations, to support their learning.
3. Provide cultural sensitivity training for teachers: Teachers should be trained in cultural sensitivity to better understand the needs and experiences of NSS students. This can involve learning about the cultural practices, traditions, and values of these students' communities.
4. Create a safe and inclusive learning environment: Schools should strive to create a safe and inclusive learning environment for all students, including NSS students. This can involve promoting diversity and inclusivity, and providing support for students who may be experiencing cultural or language barriers.
5. Offer additional resources and services: NSS students may require additional resources and services to help them succeed academically. This can include tutoring, mentoring, and counseling services, as well as extracurricular activities that promote language and cultural development.
6. Encourage family involvement: Encouraging family involvement in the educational process can help NSS students feel more connected to their school community. This can involve involving parents and guardians in decision-making processes, as well as providing opportunities for them to participate in school events and activities.
7. Provide translations and interpreters: When communicating with NSS students or their families, it's important to provide translations and interpreters to ensure that everyone is on the same page. This can involve using translation software or hiring bilingual staff members to interpret for parents and guardians.
8. Offer language classes or clubs: Providing language classes or clubs can help NSS students develop their language skills outside of the regular academic day. This can involve offering Spanish language classes, as well as other languages spoken by NSS students
