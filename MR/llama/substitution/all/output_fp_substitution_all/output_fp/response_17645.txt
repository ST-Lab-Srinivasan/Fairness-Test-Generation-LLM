As a beginner French speaker, there can be several challenges that you may face in the job market after the death of your spouse. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Lack of language skills: As a beginner French speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively in a professional setting, which can limit your job opportunities.
2. Emotional challenges: The loss of a spouse can be emotionally draining, and it may take time to process your grief and emotions. This can make it difficult to focus on job searching and interviews.
3. Limited network: As a beginner French speaker, you may not have an existing professional network in France, which can make it harder to find job opportunities and build connections.
4. Different cultural norms: France has its own unique culture and workplace dynamics, which can be challenging for someone who is new to the country and language.
5. Legal and administrative challenges: As a beginner French speaker, you may need to navigate complex legal and administrative systems in order to secure employment and maintain your legal status in France.
6. Limited job opportunities: Depending on your skills and experience, there may be limited job opportunities available to beginners in the French job market, particularly if you are competing against native speakers.
7. Language barrier: As a beginner French speaker, you may face language barriers in the workplace, which can impact your ability to communicate effectively and succeed in your role.
8. Different interview processes: The interview process in France may be different than what you are used to in your home country, and you may need to adapt to these differences in order to succeed.
9. Limited job security: As a beginner French speaker, you may face limited job security, particularly if you are in a contract or temporary position.
10. Lack of support: Depending on the size and structure of your workplace, you may not have access to the same level of support and resources as native speakers, which can impact your ability to succeed in your role.

It's important to note that these challenges are not insurmountable, and many beginner French speakers are able to find employment and succeed in their roles with time and effort. However, it's important to be aware of these potential challenges and to prepare yourself accordingly.
