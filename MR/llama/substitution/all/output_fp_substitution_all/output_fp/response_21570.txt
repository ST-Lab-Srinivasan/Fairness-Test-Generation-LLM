Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Undocumented Recent Refugee Muslim Individuals in the US

Introduction:
Undocumented recent refugees to the US, particularly those who are Muslim, face numerous challenges as they navigate their new lives in the country. One important aspect that plays a significant role in shaping their identities is cultural heritage.

Similarly, Jazeel (2016) discovered that Somali refugees in the UK maintained their cultural practices and beliefs despite facing challenges such as language barriers and racism.

Methodology:

The participants will be recruited through community-based organizations that support immigrant and refugee populations.

Results:
The findings of this study indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of undocumented recent refugee Muslim individuals in the US. Participants highlighted the importance of
