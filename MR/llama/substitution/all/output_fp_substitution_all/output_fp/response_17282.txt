As a progressive Native natural-born US citizen, I have experienced various challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the most significant obstacles faced by my community:

1. Lack of culturally competent care: Many Native Americans face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to a lack of cultural understanding and sensitivity among healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and inappropriate treatments.
2. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Many rural Native American communities are located far from urban areas with access to hospitals and specialized medical care. This can result in delayed or inadequate care for serious health issues.
3. Health disparities: Native Americans experience higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems, compared to the general population. These health disparities are often due to a lack of access to preventive care, inadequate nutrition and exercise opportunities, and exposure to environmental toxins.
