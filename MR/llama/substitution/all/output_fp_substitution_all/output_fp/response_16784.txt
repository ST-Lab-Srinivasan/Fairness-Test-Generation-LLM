Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers as native natural-born US citizens requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make these programs more inclusive:

1. Provide language learning resources: Offer a variety of language learning resources, such as textbooks, audio materials, and online courses, that cater to different learning styles and abilities. This will help learners who may have different levels of proficiency or prior knowledge of Chinese.
2. Use inclusive language teaching methods: Use teaching methods that are accessible and engaging for all learners, regardless of their cultural background or language proficiency level. For example, incorporate authentic materials, such as news articles, videos, or podcasts, into your lessons to make them more relevant and interesting.
3. Foster a supportive learning environment: Create a classroom environment that is welcoming and inclusive for all learners. Encourage learners to ask questions, share their perspectives, and participate in discussions. Use icebreaker activities or team-building exercises to help learners get to know each other and build relationships.
4. Celebrate cultural diversity: Incorporate cultural elements from the learners' backgrounds into the language learning process. For example, you could play music, watch videos, or read texts that reflect the learners' cultural identities. This will help learners feel more connected to the language and culture they are learning.
5. Provide opportunities for peer-to-peer learning: Pair learners with different cultural backgrounds to facilitate cross-cultural exchange and learning. This could involve pairing beginners with more advanced learners or learners from different ethnic or racial groups.
6. Offer flexible scheduling options: Accommodate the diverse schedules and needs of beginner Chinese speakers by offering flexible class times, online courses, or hybrid models that combine in-person and online learning.
7. Provide resources for cultural immersion: Offer opportunities for learners to immerse themselves in Chinese culture through events, workshops, or activities that promote cultural exchange. For example, you could organize a Chinese food tasting or cooking class, a traditional Chinese art workshop, or a cultural festival celebration.
