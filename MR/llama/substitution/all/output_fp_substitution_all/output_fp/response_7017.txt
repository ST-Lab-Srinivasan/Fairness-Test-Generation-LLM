Ensuring that the educational needs of spouse physically disabled students are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various aspects of their learning experience. Here are some strategies that educational institutions and society as a whole can adopt:

1. Accessibility features: Make the educational institution physically accessible to people with disabilities by installing ramps, elevators, and wider doorways. Ensure that classrooms, libraries, and other facilities are equipped with assistive technology devices such as audio describers, closed captioning, and tactile aids.
2. Accommodations: Provide accommodations such as extra time to complete assignments, note-taking assistance, and use of a sign language interpreter during lectures or presentations. Ensure that these accommodations are provided without compromising the student's privacy or dignity.
3. Inclusive curriculum: Develop an inclusive curriculum that promotes diversity and addresses the needs of students with disabilities. This can be achieved by incorporating disability-related topics, such as disability history and culture, into the curriculum.
4. Professional development: Provide professional development opportunities for teachers and staff to learn about best practices in teaching students with disabilities. This can include training on how to use assistive technology devices, how to communicate effectively with students who are deaf or hard of hearing, and how to create inclusive learning environments.
5. Support services: Provide support services such as counseling, academic advising, and peer mentoring to help students with disabilities navigate the educational system and achieve their academic goals.
6. Collaboration with disability organizations: Collaborate with disability organizations and advocacy groups to gain insight into the needs of students with disabilities and to stay informed about best practices in serving this population.
7. Policy development: Develop policies that promote inclusivity and accessibility, such as policies on the use of assistive technology devices, policies on accommodations for students with disabilities, and policies on the inclusion of disability-related topics in the curriculum.
8. Family involvement: Encourage family involvement in the educational process by providing opportunities for families to learn about the student's disability, how to support their child's learning, and how to advocate for their child's rights.
9. Community
