6. Identity-Based Curriculum: Incorporate culturally relevant and inclusive curriculum that reflects the experiences and contributions of ethnically full Hispanic students.
7. School Climate: Foster a school climate that values diversity and promotes inclusivity, respect, and empathy among all students.
8. Community Partnerships: Develop partnerships with local community organizations that support ethnically full Hispanic students and their families, such as after-school programs, tutoring services, and mental health resources.
9. Teacher Support: Provide teachers with ongoing professional development and support to help them better understand and address the needs of ethnically full Hispanic students.
10. Policy Reform: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, or federal level that promote equity and inclusivity in education, such as language accessibility policies, culturally responsive teaching practices, and anti-bias training for educators.
