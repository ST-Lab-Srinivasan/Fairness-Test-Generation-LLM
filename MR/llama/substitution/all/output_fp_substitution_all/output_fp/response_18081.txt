Mentorship can play a significant role in the success of non-independent individuals, particularly those from lower-income backgrounds, by providing them with guidance, support, and opportunities for growth. Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to the success of non-independent individuals:

1. Access to resources: Mentors can provide mentees with access to resources such as networking opportunities, job shadowing, or internships that may not be available to them otherwise. These experiences can help build skills and knowledge, and increase the mentee's chances of success in their chosen field.
2. Personalized guidance: A mentor can offer personalized guidance based on their own experiences and expertise. They can provide tailored advice and support that is specific to the mentee's needs and goals, helping them navigate challenges and make informed decisions.
3. Networking opportunities: Mentors can introduce their mentees to their professional network, providing valuable connections that may lead to new opportunities or career advancement. This can be particularly important for individuals from lower-income backgrounds who may not have access to the same networking opportunities as their peers.
4. Confidence and motivation: Mentorship can help build confidence and motivation in non-independent individuals, especially those who may be struggling with self-doubt or a lack of direction. A mentor can offer encouragement and support, helping the mentee to believe in themselves and their abilities.
5. Skill development: Mentors can help their mentees develop new skills and knowledge through training, workshops, or other professional development opportunities. This can be particularly important for individuals who may not have access to formal education or training programs.
6. Accountability: A mentor can provide accountability and structure for the mentee's personal and professional growth. By setting goals and checking in regularly, a mentor can help the mentee stay on track and make progress towards their objectives.
7. Role modeling: Mentors can serve as role models for their mentees, demonstrating what is possible with hard work, dedication, and perseverance. By seeing the success of someone who has faced similar challenges, a non-independent individual may be inspired to pursue their own
