Undocumented workers confront a variety of difficulties within the healthcare system. Here are some of the primary problems they encounter:

1. Limited access to care: Undocumented immigrants often avoid seeking medical attention due to fear of deportation and the risk of being reported to immigration authorities by healthcare providers. This can result in delayed or inadequate care for serious medical conditions, which can worsen outcomes and increase healthcare costs in the long run.
2. Language barriers: Many undocumented immigrants may not speak the dominant language of their host country, which can create communication difficulties when interacting with healthcare providers. This might lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of medical instructions, further complicating their care.
3. Cost and financial barriers: Undocumented immigrants often face significant financial obstacles in accessing healthcare services due to lack of insurance coverage or inability to afford out-of-pocket costs. This can result in delayed or foregone care, exacerbating health disparities and contributing to poor health outcomes.
4. Fear of discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may experience discrimination within the healthcare system, which can lead to mistrust and hesitation when seeking medical attention. Healthcare providers may unconsciously perpetuate biases or display insensitivity towards their cultural backgrounds, further marginalizing already vulnerable populations.
5. Difficulty navigating complex systems: Undocumented immigrants may struggle to navigate the healthcare system due to a lack of familiarity with its structures, procedures, and regulations. This can result in confusion or frustration when attempting to access care, leading to delayed or inadequate treatment.
6. Stigma and social isolation: Undocumented immigrants may face social stigma and isolation within their communities, which can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment when seeking medical attention. This can further exacerbate health disparities and hinder efforts to address them.
7. Legal barriers: Federal and state laws often create legal obstacles for undocumented immigrants in accessing healthcare services. For example, some states may deny Medicaid coverage to undocumented immigrants, or require proof of citizenship or residency
