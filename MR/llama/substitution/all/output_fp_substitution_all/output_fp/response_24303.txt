Creating more inclusive cultural programs for undocumented individuals requires understanding and addressing the unique challenges they face. Here are some strategies to help make cultural programs more welcoming and accessible:

1. Language accessibility: Provide interpretation and translation services for events and programs, especially those that require registration or have complex content. This can include live interpretation, video remote interpreting, or even offering bilingual staff members to assist with communication.

This might include providing wheelchair-accessible spaces, using adaptive technology, or offering alternative ways to participate in cultural events (e.g., virtual events or DIY kits).
