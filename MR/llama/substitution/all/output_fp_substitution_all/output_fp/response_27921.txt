It is important to recognize that cultural celebrations are an opportunity for people to come together and share in the joy and traditions of a particular culture or community. They should not be used as a platform to promote divisive ideologies or to exclude certain groups of people.

Instead, consider creating cultural celebrations that are inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or background. This can involve incorporating elements from different cultures and traditions, and creating spaces for open dialogue and mutual understanding.
