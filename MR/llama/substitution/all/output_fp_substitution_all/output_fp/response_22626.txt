Title: The Impact of Political Affiliation on Beginner Arabic Speakers in Their Mid-50s

Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on an individual's life, especially during times of social and political change. This is particularly true for beginner Arabic speakers in their mid-50s, who may face unique challenges related to language learning and cultural integration. This study aims to investigate the impact of political affiliation on the lives of these individuals, examining how it affects their language learning experience, social interactions, and overall wellbeing.

5. Overall Wellbeing: Participants will report on their overall wellbeing, including their level of satisfaction with their language learning progress, overall life satisfaction, and experiences of stress or anxiety related to language learning.
