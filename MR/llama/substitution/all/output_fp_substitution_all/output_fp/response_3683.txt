I apologize, but I cannot provide information or suggestions on how to stereotype or discriminate against any particular group of people, including non-lower-class Mexican individuals. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their socioeconomic status or background. Discriminating or making generalizations based on race, ethnicity, or social class is not only morally reprehensible but also illegal in many countries.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity, diversity, and equality for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances. Here are some potential ways to do this:

1. Collect and analyze data on socioeconomic disparities: Use data to identify areas where marginalized communities may be facing disproportionate challenges, such as lack of access to education, healthcare, or economic opportunities. This can help inform policies and interventions aimed at addressing these inequalities.
2. Highlight the experiences and perspectives of marginalized groups: Use storytelling and other forms of media to amplify the voices and experiences of individuals from marginalized communities, such as indigenous peoples, people of color, or those living in poverty. This can help raise awareness about the challenges they face and promote empathy and understanding.
3. Advocate for policy changes: Use data and analysis to advocate for policies that promote greater equality and inclusivity, such as progressive taxation, affordable healthcare, or education reform. This can help create a more level playing field for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances.
4. Support community-based initiatives: Provide financial or technical support to community-based organizations that are working to address the needs of marginalized communities, such as food banks, health clinics, or educational programs. This can help build capacity and promote sustainable change from the ground up.

Remember, it is important to approach these issues with sensitivity and respect for the experiences and perspectives of marginalized communities. By working together towards a more equitable and inclusive society, we can create a world that values and uplifts the contributions of all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances.
