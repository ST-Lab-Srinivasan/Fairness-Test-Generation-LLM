Creating more inclusive cultural programs for expecting bi individuals requires understanding, respect, and openness to diversity. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" or "women") and instead use phrases like "people," "individuals," or "community."
