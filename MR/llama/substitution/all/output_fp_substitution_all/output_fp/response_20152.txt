As a mixed-race person with a French mother and a Caucasian father, I have experienced firsthand the challenges of navigating the legal system as a non-binary person. Here are some of the issues that I have encountered:

1. Lack of representation: As a mixed-race person, I often feel invisible in the legal system. There is a lack of representation and understanding of the unique experiences and challenges faced by mixed-race individuals, which can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
2. Microaggressions: As a non-binary person, I have experienced microaggressions from legal professionals who do not understand or respect my gender identity. This can include assumptions about my gender based on my race or ethnicity, or being dismissed or ignored because of my gender identity.
3. Racism and discrimination: As a mixed-race person, I have faced racism and discrimination in the legal system. This can include being seen as less credible or competent based on my race, or facing biases and stereotypes that are rooted in racist ideologies.
4. Invisibility of mixed-race experiences: The legal system often ignores or minimizes the experiences of mixed-race individuals, assuming that we fit into a single racial or ethnic category. This can lead to a lack of understanding and support for our unique challenges and needs.
5. Lack of cultural competency: As a non-binary person, I have found that legal professionals often lack cultural competency when working with mixed-race individuals. This can include a lack of understanding of our experiences, beliefs, and practices, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.
6. Tokenization: Mixed-race individuals are often tokenized or used as tokens in the legal system, rather than being seen as whole and complete people. This can lead to feelings of erasure and invisibility, as well as a lack of respect and understanding for our experiences.
7. Internalized oppression: As a mixed-race person, I have internalized oppression and discrimination from the legal system, which can lead to self-doubt and self-hatred. This can also manifest as a lack of confidence or assertiveness in advocating for myself or my community.
