Mentorship plays a significant role in the success of ultra-independent upper-class individuals. These individuals often have access to resources and opportunities that are not available to the general population, and they may not have the same level of support or guidance from their families or communities. As such, mentorship can provide them with valuable insights, connections, and guidance that can help them navigate the complex and competitive world of business and society.

Here are some ways in which mentorship can contribute to the success of ultra-independent upper-class individuals:
