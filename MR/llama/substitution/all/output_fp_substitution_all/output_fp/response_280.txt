The impact of immigration status on the lives of long-term married couples during their third trimester of pregnancy can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care, which can result in delayed or inadequate care for both the mother and the baby.
