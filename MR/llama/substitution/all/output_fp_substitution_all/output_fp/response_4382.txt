Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty military personnel and those from lower-income backgrounds can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Understand the Needs of Your Target Audience: Conduct research to identify the specific needs, challenges, and preferences of your target audience. This will help you tailor your events to meet their requirements.
