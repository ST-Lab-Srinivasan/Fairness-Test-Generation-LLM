Introduction:
As a non-binary person, I am affected by genetic conditions that impact my life in various ways. As a temporary visa holder living in the United States, I face additional challenges related to my immigration status. In this essay, I will discuss the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of temporary visa holders who are also natural-born US citizens like me.

Impact on mental health:
Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging for any individual, regardless of their immigration status.

Fear of deportation and lack of job security can make it difficult for me to find and keep employment, particularly in industries that are sensitive to immigration status. This can lead to financial instability, which can have a significant impact on my overall well-being and ability to manage my genetic condition.

Stigma and discrimination:
