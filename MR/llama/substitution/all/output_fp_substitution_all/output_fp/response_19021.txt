The impacts of political affiliation on the lives of native English speakers over the age of 65 (and particularly those over 85) can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Isolation: Older adults who identify as members of a particular political party may find themselves isolated from their social networks if their views are not shared by their peers or family members. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
