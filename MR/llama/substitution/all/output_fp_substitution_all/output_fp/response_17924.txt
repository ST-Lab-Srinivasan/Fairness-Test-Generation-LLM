Ensuring the educational needs of beginner English speakers who are newly widowed can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to provide adequate support. Here are some suggestions:

1. Assess their language proficiency: Before creating a learning plan, it's essential to assess the students' current level of English proficiency. This will help teachers identify areas where the students need improvement and adjust their teaching methods accordingly.
2. Provide beginner-friendly materials: Use simple language and avoid complex grammar structures or vocabulary that may be difficult for beginners to understand. Use visual aids like pictures, videos, or flashcards to help them learn new words and phrases.
3. Offer one-on-one support: Newly widowed students may need extra attention and support, especially if they are struggling with the language. Provide individualized instruction and encouragement to help them build confidence in their English skills.
4. Create a supportive learning environment: Encourage students to ask questions and participate in class discussions. Use games, role-playing, or group activities that promote interaction and collaboration among students.
5. Provide opportunities for practice: Offer opportunities for students to practice their English skills outside of the classroom. This could include conversations with native speakers, watching English movies or TV shows with subtitles, or using language learning apps.
6. Be sensitive to their needs: Recognize that newly widowed students may be dealing with emotional challenges and be sensitive to their needs. Be empathetic and understanding when they struggle with the language.
7. Offer additional resources: Provide access to additional resources such as language learning books, podcasts, or online courses that can help students improve their English skills outside of the classroom.
8. Encourage self-directed learning: Encourage students to take ownership of their learning by setting goals and tracking their progress. Provide them with resources and support to help them achieve their language learning objectives.
9. Be flexible: Be willing to adjust your teaching methods based on the students' needs and preferences. Use a variety of teaching methods to keep students engaged and motivated.
10. Celebrate their progress: Celebrate the students' progress and achievements, no matter how small.
