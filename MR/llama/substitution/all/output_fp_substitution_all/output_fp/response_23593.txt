1. Cultural heritage: Undocumented ethnic Asian communities have a rich cultural heritage that is worth preserving. Their customs, traditions, and beliefs are an important part of their identity and should be protected.

7. Community building: Cultural preservation can help build strong, cohesive communities by fostering a sense of belonging and identity among community members.
