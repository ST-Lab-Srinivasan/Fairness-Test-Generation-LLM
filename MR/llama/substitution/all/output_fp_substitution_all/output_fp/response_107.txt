Ensuring that the voices of native Arabic speakers, particularly those who are recently undocumented to the US, are heard in decision-making processes requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Outreach and Engagement: Organizations serving this population should engage in community outreach and outreach efforts to build trust and relationships with local communities. This can be done through various means such as hosting community events, partnering with local organizations, and using social media platforms.

3. Capacity Building and Leadership Development: Providing capacity building and leadership development opportunities for native Arabic speakers can help build their skills and confidence to participate in decision-making processes. This can include training on policy advocacy, public speaking, and community organizing.
4. Research and Data Collection: Conducting research and collecting data on the experiences and needs of native Arabic speakers can provide valuable insights into how decision-making processes can be improved. This research can help identify gaps in services and inform policy changes that promote inclusivity and equity.
5. Collaboration with Decision-Makers: Building relationships with decision-makers, such as elected officials, government agencies, and community leaders, is crucial for ensuring the voices of native Arabic speakers are heard. This can involve organizing meetings, briefings, and other events to educate decision-makers about the issues facing this population.
