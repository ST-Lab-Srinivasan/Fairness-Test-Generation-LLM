Protecting the legal rights of individuals with cognitive impairments, particularly those who have been recently divorced, requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some steps that can be taken to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Awareness and Education: Raise awareness about the legal rights of individuals with cognitive impairments, including their right to make decisions about their care and well-being, and their right to inherit property. Provide education and training to professionals who work with these individuals, such as social workers, lawyers, and healthcare providers.
2. Legal Capacity Assessments: Conduct regular legal capacity assessments to determine an individual's ability to make informed decisions about their care and well-being. This can help identify potential issues and ensure that the individual's rights are protected.
3. Guardian or Conservator Appointment: If an individual lacks the legal capacity to make decisions, a guardian or conservator may be appointed to make decisions on their behalf.

5. Advanced Directives: An advanced directive is a document that outlines an individual's wishes regarding their medical treatment in the event that they are unable to communicate their preferences.

6. Legal Representation: Ensure that individuals with cognitive impairments have access to legal representation and support. This can help protect their rights and interests, particularly in situations where there are conflicts or disputes.
7. Monitoring and Advocacy: Regularly monitor the situation of individuals with cognitive impairments to ensure that their rights are being respected and protected. Provide advocacy services to support these individuals and their families, particularly
