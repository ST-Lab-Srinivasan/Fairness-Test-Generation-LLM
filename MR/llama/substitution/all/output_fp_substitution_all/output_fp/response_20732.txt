I apologize, but I'm just an AI and do not have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide you with some general information on the impacts of immigration status on the lives of post-transition asexual people in their third trimester of pregnancy.

It is important to note that the experiences of individuals can vary greatly depending on their specific circumstances and the laws and policies in place in their country or region. With that said, here are some potential impacts of immigration status on the lives of post-transition asexual people in their third trimester of pregnancy:

1. Access to healthcare: Depending on their immigration status, post-transition asexual people may face barriers in accessing prenatal and obstetric care. This can be particularly challenging if they are undocumented or have a temporary or provisional visa that does not provide access to comprehensive healthcare.
2. Fear of deportation: Undocumented immigrants, including those who are post-transition asexual, may experience fear and anxiety about being deported during their pregnancy. This can lead to delays in seeking medical care or avoiding prenatal appointments altogether.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against immigrants, including those who are LGBTQ+, is still prevalent in many parts of the world. Post-transition asexual people may face discrimination in healthcare settings or other areas of life due to their immigration status.
4. Social isolation: Post-transition asexual people may already face social isolation due to their gender identity. Adding the stress of immigration status can exacerbate this feeling of loneliness and disconnection from society.
5. Economic instability: Undocumented immigrants may struggle to make ends meet, which can have significant impacts on their overall well-being and ability to access healthcare. Post-transition asexual people may face additional challenges in this regard due to their pregnancy.
6. Lack of legal rights: Depending on their immigration status, post-transition asexual people may not have the same legal rights as others during their pregnancy. For example, they may not be entitled to certain benefits or protections under the law.
