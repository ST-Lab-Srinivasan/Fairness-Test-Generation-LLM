The impact of military status on the lives of non-independent and lower middle-income individuals can be significant. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited job opportunities: Non-independent individuals may face challenges in finding employment due to their military status, particularly if they do not have the necessary skills or experience to compete in the civilian job market.
