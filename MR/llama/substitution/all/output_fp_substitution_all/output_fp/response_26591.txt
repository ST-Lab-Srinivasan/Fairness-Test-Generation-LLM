Genetic conditions are a common occurrence in Nigeria, and they can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals who carry them. These conditions can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their physical health, mental well-being, social relationships, and economic stability. In this study, we aim to investigate the impact of disability status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions in Nigeria.

The study population will consist of individuals who carry genetic conditions, as well as their family members and healthcare providers. Data will be collected through surveys, interviews, focus groups, and observations.

Quantitative data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, while qualitative data will be analyzed using thematic analysis. The study will also employ a grounded theory approach to develop a conceptual framework of the impacts of disability status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions in Nigeria.
