Addressing the specific needs of Native American natural-born US citizens who are recent divorcees and hold a PhD can be approached in a number of ways. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Cultural sensitivity and respect: It is important to approach this population with cultural sensitivity and respect. Native Americans have a unique history and culture that has been impacted by colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression. As a result, they may have specific needs and concerns that are related to their cultural identity and well-being.
2. Community-based research: Conducting community-based research with Native American populations can help ensure that the research is culturally appropriate and responsive to their needs. This involves working closely with community members, elders, and other leaders to identify research priorities and develop research questions that are relevant and meaningful to the community.
3. Capacity building: Building the capacity of Native American communities to conduct research and analyze data can help ensure that they have the skills and resources needed to address their specific needs. This may involve providing training and technical assistance in areas such as research design, data analysis, and dissemination of findings.
4. Collaborative partnerships: Building collaborative partnerships between academic institutions, community-based organizations, and government agencies can help ensure that research is conducted in a culturally appropriate and responsive manner. These partnerships can also help to ensure that the research is relevant and useful to the communities being studied.
5. Inclusive and participatory design: Ensuring that the research is inclusive and participatory can help to build trust and buy-in from community members. This may involve involving community members in all stages of the research process, from questionnaire development to data analysis and interpretation.
6. Focus on intersectionality: Many Native American communities are impacted by multiple forms of oppression, including racism, sexism, homophobia, and classism. Acknowledging and addressing these intersections of oppression can help ensure that the research is culturally appropriate and responsive to the specific needs of the community.
7. Advocacy and policy change: Finally, conducting research that informs advocacy and policy change can help to address the systemic issues impacting Native American communities. This may involve working with community members and organizations to identify policy priorities
