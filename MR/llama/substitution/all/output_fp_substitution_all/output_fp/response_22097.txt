Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for recent temporary visa holders to India, including slightly transgender individuals, requires sensitivity and understanding of their needs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using terms that are derogatory or offensive to any particular group. For example, instead of using the term "man" or "woman," use terms like "person" or "individual."
2. Accessibility: Make sure that the venue and celebration events are accessible to all, including those with disabilities. Provide wheelchair accessibility, audio descriptions, and braille signage where necessary.
3. Gender-Neutral Restrooms: Ensure that restrooms are gender-neutral and inclusive of all genders. This can be done by providing unisex restrooms or gender-neutral signs on existing restrooms.
4. Dress Code: Encourage attendees to dress in a way that makes them feel comfortable and confident, without enforcing strict gender norms. For example, allow people to wear clothing that does not conform to traditional gender roles or expectations.
5. Inclusive Programming: Include programming that is relevant and meaningful to all attendees, regardless of their gender identity. This can include workshops, performances, or discussions that address issues affecting the transgender community.
6. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces where individuals can express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done by providing designated areas for people to relax, socialize, or engage in activities without feeling uncomfortable or unsafe.
7. Education and Awareness: Offer educational workshops or resources that raise awareness about the transgender community and the challenges they face. This can help attendees better understand and appreciate the experiences of slightly transgender individuals.
8. Partnership with Local Organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that support the transgender community to co-host events or provide additional resources and support. This can help build a stronger and more inclusive community.
9. Inclusive Marketing: Use marketing materials that are inclusive of all genders and avoid using language that is offensive or alienating
