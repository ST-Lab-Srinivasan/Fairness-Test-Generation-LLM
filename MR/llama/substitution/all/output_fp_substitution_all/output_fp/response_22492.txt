Creating more inclusive cultural events for individuals with genetic conditions requires thoughtful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions to make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accessibility features: Ensure that the event venue is wheelchair-accessible, has ramps or elevators, and provides accessible restrooms.

9. Involve individuals with genetic conditions in the planning process: Invite individuals with genetic conditions to particip
