Protecting the legal rights of separated active-duty individuals is crucial to ensure they receive fair and just treatment after leaving the military. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Familiarize yourself with USERRA: The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) is a federal law that provides protections for service members who are separating from the military. Ensure you are aware of USERRA's provisions regarding job protection, retirement benefits, and other rights.
2. Provide support during transition: Offer resources and support to help separating service members navigate the transition to civilian life. This may include providing information on job search strategies, resume writing, and interviewing techniques.
3. Advocate for military-friendly legislation: Work with lawmakers to pass legislation that supports the legal rights of separated active-duty individuals. For example, supporting laws that protect veterans' employment rights or provide additional support for service members who are struggling to find civilian employment.
4. Encourage collaboration between government agencies: Encourage collaboration between government agencies, such as the Department of Defense and the Department of Labor, to ensure a smooth transition for separating service members. This can involve sharing information and resources to help service members access the benefits they are entitled to under USERRA.
5. Provide legal assistance: Offer free or low-cost legal services to separated active-duty individuals who may need help navigating the civilian job market, negotiating contracts, or resolving employment-related disputes.
6. Offer career counseling: Provide career counseling and guidance to separating service members to help them identify their strengths and interests and explore potential civilian careers. This can involve conducting career assessments, providing job market information, and offering advice on how to translate military skills and experience into the civilian workforce.
7. Promote veteran-friendly hiring practices: Encourage employers to adopt veteran-friendly hiring practices by providing training and resources to help them understand the value of hiring veterans and the benefits of USERRA. This can involve partnering with organizations that promote veteran employment, such as the U.S. Department of Labor
