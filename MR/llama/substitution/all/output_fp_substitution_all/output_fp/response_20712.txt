Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and growth of individuals, including Native American natural-born US citizens who have recently turned 65 (and are now over 85 years old). Here are some ways mentorship can impact their lives:

1. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Many Native American communities face challenges in preserving their cultural heritage and traditions, particularly among younger generations. Elder mentors who have lived through these experiences can share their knowledge and wisdom with younger community members, helping to preserve and revitalize cultural practices and beliefs.
2. Language learning: For many Native American communities, language loss is a significant concern. Elder mentors who are fluent in their native language can teach younger community members how to speak, read, and write their language, ensuring that these skills are passed down to future generations.
3. Traditional knowledge transmission: Elder mentors can share their expertise and knowledge of traditional practices, such as medicinal plants, hunting and gathering techniques, and craft-making.

By building relationships between older community members and younger ones, mentorship programs can promote cultural exchange and ensure that knowledge and traditions are passed down effectively.
6. Community engagement: Elder mentors can inspire and motivate younger community members to become involved in their communities, promoting a sense of civic engagement and social responsibility. By sharing their experiences and wisdom, elder mentors can help younger individuals develop a deeper appreciation for their cultural heritage and the importance of giving back to their communities.
7. Personal growth and development: Mentorship programs can provide opportunities for personal growth and development among Native American elders. Through these programs, they can learn new skills, gain confidence, and build self-esteem, which can
