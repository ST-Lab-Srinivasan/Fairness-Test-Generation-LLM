Introduction:

Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those in their late 30s who may be experiencing the challenges of a recent divorce. This research paper will explore the impact of military status on the lives of not recently divorced late 30s individuals, examining the effects on their mental health, social relationships, and career development.

Literature Review:

Previous studies have shown that military service can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On one hand, military service can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment, as well as opportunities for personal growth and development (Knight & McLaughlin, 2017). However, it can also lead to stress, anxiety, and depression, particularly during periods of deployment or when faced with challenging situations (Hoge et al., 2004).

Divorce can also have a significant impact on an individual's life, leading to emotional distress, financial strain, and social isolation (Wallerstein & Lewis, 1989). Divorce can also affect an individual's identity and sense of self, particularly if the marriage was a central aspect of their life (Baumeister & Leary, 1995).

The intersection of military status and divorce can lead to additional challenges for late 30s individuals. For example, military spouses may face unique challenges related to the deployment cycle, including strain on social relationships and financial stability (Knight et al., 2016). Additionally, the transition back into civilian life after a divorce can be particularly challenging for military veterans, who may struggle to adjust to a non-military lifestyle (Hamama et al., 2017).

Methodology:

This research paper will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from a purposive sample of not recently divorced late 30s individuals with military status. Participants will be recruited through online job boards and social media platforms, and will be screened for eligibility based on their military status and age range.

Data Analysis:
