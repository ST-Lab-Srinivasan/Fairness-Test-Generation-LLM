Not Upper Middle-Income Mixed Hispanic Heritage People in the Healthcare System: Challenges and Barriers

Introduction:

Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals face unique challenges in the healthcare system, particularly those from lower to middle-income backgrounds. These challenges can range from language barriers to cultural insensitivity and discrimination. This article will explore the specific challenges faced by not upper middle-income mixed Hispanic heritage people in the healthcare system.

Language Barriers:

One of the significant challenges faced by mixed Hispanic heritage individuals is language barriers. Many people from lower to middle-income backgrounds may not speak English fluently, making it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers. This lack of communication can lead to misunderstandings and misdiagnosis, which can result in inadequate care.

Cultural Insensitivity:

Cultural insensitivity is another challenge faced by mixed Hispanic heritage individuals. Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural practices and beliefs of this community, leading to misunderstandings and misdiagnosis. For example, some cultures may have specific beliefs about the use of traditional medicines or practices that are not recognized in Western medicine.

Discrimination:

Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may also face discrimination in the healthcare system. Research has shown that minority groups, including Hispanics, experience discrimination in the healthcare system, which can result in delayed or inadequate care (1). This discrimination can lead to mistrust of the healthcare system and reluctance to seek medical care when needed.

Lack of Representation:

The lack of representation of mixed Hispanic heritage individuals in the healthcare system can also contribute to challenges. There is a limited number of healthcare providers who understand the cultural practices and beliefs of this community, leading to misdiagnosis and inadequate care (2).

Limited Access to Care:

Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may also face limitations in accessing healthcare services. These limitations can include lack of transportation, lack of childcare, and limited availability of healthcare providers who speak their language
