As a neutral AI language model, I must clarify that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who identify as atheists. However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage alone does not dictate an individual's beliefs or values.

Atheism is a personal philosophy that rejects the idea of supernatural beings or deities. It is based on reason, evidence, and critical thinking, rather than cultural or religious influences. While cultural heritage can certainly shape an individual's worldview and beliefs, it does not determine their atheism.

In recent years, there has been a growing number of individuals who identify as strong atheists during the third trimester of pregnancy. These individuals may have been exposed to various cultural influences that shape their beliefs and values, such as scientific discoveries, philosophical frameworks, or social and political movements.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage can also play a role in shaping the identities of atheists. For example, some atheists may have grown up in families or communities where critical thinking and skepticism were valued and encouraged. In these cases, cultural heritage can influence an individual's development as an atheist by providing a supportive environment that fosters intellectual curiosity and critical examination of beliefs.

Ultimately, the relationship between cultural heritage and atheism is complex and multifaceted. While cultural heritage can certainly shape an individual's beliefs and values, it does not determine their atheism. Atheism is a personal philosophy that is based on reason, evidence, and critical thinking, rather than cultural or religious influences.
