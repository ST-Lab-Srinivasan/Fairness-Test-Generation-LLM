I'm glad you're interested in supporting the civic engagement of Native American communities! However, I must clarify that the term "extreme ultra-independent Native natural-born US citizen people" is problematic and could be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes. It's important to recognize that Native Americans are not a monolithic group and cannot be defined by a single set of characteristics. Instead, it's essential to approach this issue with respect, empathy, and an understanding of the diverse experiences and perspectives within Native American communities.

To support the civic engagement of Native Americans, you could consider the following strategies:

1. Listen and learn: Take the time to listen to the experiences and perspectives of Native American communities. Learn about their history, culture, and struggles. This will help you better understand their needs and how you can best support them.
2. Advocate for policies that support tribal sovereignty: Tribal sovereignty is a critical issue affecting Native American communities. You can advocate for policies that recognize and respect the inherent sovereignty of Native American tribes, such as supporting legislation that affirms tribal self-governance and cultural preservation.
3. Support voter registration and turnout: Many Native American communities face barriers to voting, including lack of access to polling stations, language barriers, and historical discrimination. You can support efforts to register and turn out Native American voters by providing transportation to polling stations, translating voting materials into Native languages, and raising awareness about the importance of voting.
4. Invest in education and economic development: Many Native American communities face significant challenges in accessing quality education and economic opportunities. You can support initiatives that invest in education, job training, and economic development programs to help build stronger, more resilient communities.
5. Amplify Native voices: Rather than speaking over or for Native Americans, amplify their voices by promoting their stories, art, and perspectives. This can be done through media platforms, cultural events, and community outreach initiatives.
6. Collaborate with Native-led organizations: Support Native-led organizations that are working towards the betterment of Native American communities.
