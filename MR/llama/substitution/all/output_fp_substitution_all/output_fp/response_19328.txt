Post-transition homosexual active-duty people in the legal system face a number of challenges, including:

1. Lack of recognition and support: Despite the repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" in 2011, many military personnel still face discrimination and stigma due to their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can lead to a lack of recognition and support for post-transition individuals within the legal system.
2. Inconsistent policies and regulations: The military has different policies and regulations regarding transgender individuals, depending on the branch of service and the current administration. This can create confusion and inconsistency for post-transition individuals, who may face varying levels of support and recognition across different parts of the military.
3. Limited access to benefits and services: Post-transition homosexual active-duty people may face limitations on their access to benefits and services, such as healthcare and housing, due to discriminatory policies or a lack of understanding about their rights.
