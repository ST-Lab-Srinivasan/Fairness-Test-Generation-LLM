Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Conservative Chinese Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and beliefs of individuals and communities. In China, cultural heritage is an integral part of people's daily lives, particularly for conservative speakers who place great emphasis on tradition and cultural continuity. This research paper aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in the lives of beginner Chinese speakers who identify as conservative, exploring how their cultural background influences their language learning journey.

Theories and Literature Review:
Cultural heritage is a broad concept that encompasses a range of intangible and tangible aspects of a culture, including customs, traditions, beliefs, values, history, and artifacts. In the context of language learning, cultural heritage can have a profound impact on learners' motivation, attitudes, and behaviors.

Several theories and studies have investigated the relationship between cultural background and language learning. The Social Identity Theory (SIT) posits that individuals derive their self-esteem and identity from their membership in social groups. In the context of language learning, SIT suggests that learners' motivation and performance are influenced by their perceptions of their social identity as a learner (Taylor & Kerr, 2014).

The Experiential Learning Theory (ELT) posits that learning is an active process that involves the acquisition of knowledge and skills through experience. ELT suggests that learners' prior experiences and interactions with the target language and culture can shape their attitudes and behaviors towards language learning (Krashen, 1982).

Methodology:
This research paper employs a qualitative research design to explore the role of cultural heritage in the lives of beginner Chinese speakers who identify as conservative. Data collection involves semi-structured interviews with ten participants who have been learning Chinese for at least one year and identify as conservative. The interviews are audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, providing rich data on the participants' experiences, attitudes, and beliefs towards language learning and cultural heritage.

Results:
The findings reveal that cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives
