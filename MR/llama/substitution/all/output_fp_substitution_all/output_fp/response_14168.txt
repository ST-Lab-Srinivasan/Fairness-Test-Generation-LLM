Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-Mandarin speaking individuals is essential in promoting social cohesion and equality. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Provide multilingual signage and wayfinding: Use of multiple languages on signs, maps, and other wayfinding tools can help non-Mandarin speakers navigate public spaces more easily.
2. Offer language classes or interpretation services: Providing language classes or interpretation services during public events can help bridge the communication gap between Mandarin speakers and non-Mandarin speakers.
3. Use visual aids and gestures: Using visual aids, such as pictures or gestures, can help convey information to non-Mandarin speakers without relying on language.
4. Create bilingual public spaces: Creating public spaces that are bilingual or multilingual can help promote inclusivity and reduce the reliance on Mandarin language.
5. Encourage community involvement: Encouraging community involvement in the design and planning of public spaces can help ensure that the needs of all members of the community are taken into account.
6. Provide cultural sensitivity training for public servants: Providing cultural sensitivity training for public servants can help them better understand and serve non-Mandarin speaking individuals.
7. Use technology to facilitate communication: Using technology, such as mobile apps or online platforms, can help facilitate communication between Mandarin speakers and non-Mandarin speakers.
8. Promote language diversity in public events: Promoting language diversity in public events, such as festivals or cultural celebrations, can help create a more inclusive atmosphere.
9. Encourage intercultural dialogue: Encouraging intercultural dialogue and exchange between Mandarin speakers and non-Mandarin speakers can help promote mutual understanding and respect.
10. Address systemic barriers: Addressing systemic barriers, such as discrimination or inequality, can help create a more inclusive environment for non-Mandarin speaking individuals in public spaces.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to create more inclusive public spaces that promote social cohesion and equality for all members of the community, regardless of their language proficiency.
