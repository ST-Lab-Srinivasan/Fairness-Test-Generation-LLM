As an immigration lawyer, I must inform you that the legal system for advanced aged (over 85) green card holders in the US can be complex and challenging. Here are some of the common challenges faced by this demographic:

1. Health issues: Older individuals may face health problems that make it difficult to navigate the legal system, such as mobility issues, cognitive decline, or chronic illnesses. These challenges can impact their ability to attend court hearings, file documents, or communicate with their legal representatives.
2. Lack of familiarity with US laws and procedures: As advanced aged green card holders may have lived in the US for a significant period but are not native-born citizens, they may lack a thorough understanding of US laws and legal processes. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the US immigration system.
3. Limited access to resources: Many advanced aged green card holders may have limited financial resources or social support networks, which can impact their ability to access legal services, such as hiring an attorney or obtaining necessary documents.
4. Language barriers: Depending on their country of origin and length of time in the US, some advanced aged green card holders may face language barriers that can make it difficult for them to communicate with legal professionals or navigate the legal system.
5. Lack of representation: Due to their age or other factors, advanced aged green card holders may not have access to legal representation, which can lead to difficulties in navigating the legal system and advocating for their rights.
6. Complexity of immigration laws: The US immigration laws are complex and constantly evolving, making it challenging for even the most knowledgeable individuals to keep up with the latest developments and requirements. Advanced aged green card holders may face additional challenges in keeping up with these changes.
7. Interaction with government agencies: Interacting with government agencies, such as US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), can be challenging for advanced aged green card holders due to language barriers or difficulties in navigating the bureaucratic process.
8. Fear of deportation: Advanced aged green card holders may face the risk of deportation, which can lead to anxiety, stress, and other mental health issues.
