To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers and beginner Chinese speakers, you could collect and analyze data on various aspects of language learning and proficiency. Here are some ideas for data collection and analysis:

1. Language proficiency surveys: Conduct surveys to assess the language proficiency of beginner learners in both English and Chinese. You can use standardized language proficiency tests, such as the TOEFL or IELTS for English, or the HSK for Chinese. Analyze the results to identify areas where learners struggle the most.

7. User experience: Collect data on the user experience of language learning apps, websites, or other digital resources used by beginner learners. Analyze the features and functionality that learners find most useful or frustrating, and identify any areas for improvement.
