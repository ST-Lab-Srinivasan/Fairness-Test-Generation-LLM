Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Recent Green Card Holders to Canada from Ethnic Asian Backgrounds

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and experiences of individuals from diverse backgrounds. For recent green card holders to Canada from ethnically Asian backgrounds, cultural heritage can have both unifying and divisive effects. This paper will examine the ways in which cultural heritage influences the lives of these individuals, exploring the themes of identity, belonging, and cultural preservation.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, utilizing semi-structured interviews to gather data from recent green card holders to Canada from ethnically Asian backgrounds.

The analysis will explore tensions between maintaining cultural traditions and adapting to Canadian culture, as well as the role of cultural heritage in shaping sense of belonging and identity.

Expected Findings:
This study aims to contribute to our understanding of how cultural heritage influences the experiences of immigrants from ethnically Asian backgrounds in Canada. Specifically, we expect to find that participants' cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping their identities and experiences in Canada, with both positive and negative consequences.
