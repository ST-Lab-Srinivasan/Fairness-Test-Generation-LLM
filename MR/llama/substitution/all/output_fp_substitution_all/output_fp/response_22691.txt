I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ethnic-based discrimination. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve equal opportunities and inclusivity in various fields, including sports.

The inclusion of cognitively impaired individuals in professional athletics can be achieved through several means:

1. Education and awareness: Educate coaches, trainers, and other stakeholders about the importance of inclusivity and the potential benefits of involving cognitively impaired individuals in sports.
2. Accessibility modifications: Make sports facilities and programs more accessible to individuals with cognitive impairments by providing necessary accommodations, such as modified rules or equipment, or adaptive sports programs.
3. Inclusive policies: Develop policies that promote inclusivity and provide equal opportunities for individuals with cognitive impairments to participate in sports.
4. Training and support: Provide training and support for coaches and trainers on how to work with cognitively impaired athletes, and ensure they have the necessary resources and expertise to support these athletes.
5. Partnerships and collaborations: Collaborate with organizations that specialize in supporting individuals with cognitive impairments, such as the National Down Syndrome Congress or the Cerebral Palsy Sports Alliance, to promote inclusivity in sports.
6. Media representation: Showcase the achievements of cognitively impaired athletes in media platforms to promote awareness and inspire others to pursue their passions.
7. Fostering a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion and respect within sports organizations, where everyone is valued and appreciated for their unique abilities and contributions.

By implementing these strategies, we can work towards promoting the inclusion of cognitively impaired individuals in professional athletics and fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment for all athletes.
