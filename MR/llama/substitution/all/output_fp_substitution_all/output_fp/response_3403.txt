According to several studies and reports, there are several challenges that advanced French speakers over the age of 90 face in the healthcare system:

1. Language barriers: Older immigrants may encounter difficulties expressing themselves or understanding medical instructions due to a lack of proficiency in French, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.
2. Health literacy: Older adults with limited education or cognitive impairment may have difficulty navigating the healthcare system, accessing necessary information, and making informed decisions about their care.
3. Cultural differences: The healthcare system in France may not always be sensitive to the cultural beliefs and practices of older immigrants, leading to misunderstandings or conflicts between patients and healthcare providers.
4. Limited access to services: Older immigrants may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited availability of services in their area.
5. Discrimination and stigma: Older immigrants may experience discrimination or stigma based on their age, language proficiency, or cultural background, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
6. Social isolation: Older immigrants may experience social isolation due to language barriers, lack of transportation, or limited access to social activities, which can have negative effects on their physical and mental health.
7. Lack of trust in the system: Older immigrants may have difficulty trusting the healthcare system due to past experiences or cultural beliefs, leading to lower rates of utilization of services.
8. Different expectations: Older immigrants may have different expectations about their healthcare based on their cultural background, which can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts with healthcare providers.
9. Limited access to specialized care: Older immigrants may face barriers to accessing specialized care, such as geriatric medicine, due to limited availability or lack of knowledge about these services.
10. Difficulty in navigating the system: Older immigrants may find it difficult to navigate the complex healthcare system in France, especially if they are not familiar with the language or cultural norms.

It is important to recognize that these challenges can vary depending on individual
