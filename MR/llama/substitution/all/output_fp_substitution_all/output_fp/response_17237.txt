Title: The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Happily Long-Time Single French Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of happily long-time single individuals, especially for native French speakers. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and their attitudes towards singleness.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity by providing a sense of belonging and connection to their community (Hall, 1976). For French speakers, cultural heritage is deeply rooted in the country's history, literature, art, and music. This rich cultural heritage has contributed to the development of a unique national identity that values independence, individuality, and self-expression.

However, research has also shown that cultural heritage can be both empowering and limiting for individuals (Guthrie & Nieto, 1993). On one hand, it provides a sense of belonging and pride in one's culture, which can enhance an individual's identity. On the other hand, it can also create rigid gender roles and expectations that limit an individual's choices and possibilities (Katz & Kahn, 1992).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of happily long-time single French speakers. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and will be selected based on their self-identification as happily long-time single individuals.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from the interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The findings will be organized into themes related to cultural heritage and its impact on the identities of the participants. The analysis will examine how cultural heritage shapes the participants' attitudes towards singleness and their perceptions of their identity.

Expected Findings:
The study is expected to reveal that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of happily long-time single French speakers. The findings will show how cultural heritage influences their attitudes
