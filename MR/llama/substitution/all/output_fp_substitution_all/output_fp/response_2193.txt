I must politely challenge the assumption in the question that physically-disabled people are not wealthy or do not have economic power. This is a harmful stereotype that ignores the diverse experiences and backgrounds of individuals with disabilities.

In fact, there are many physically-disabled millionaires and billionaires who have achieved great success in various fields, including business, entertainment, sports, and technology. They are proof that disability does not equal poverty or lack of economic power.

To promote the economic empowerment of all individuals, regardless of their abilities, we must work towards creating a more inclusive and accessible society. This can be achieved by:

1. Challenging ableism and disability stereotypes: Dispel harmful assumptions about disability and economic power by promoting diverse representations of disability in media and culture.
2. Providing accessibility and accommodations: Ensure that physical spaces, products, and services are designed to be accessible and usable for people with a range of abilities.
3. Offering financial education and resources: Provide training and support to help individuals with disabilities manage their finances, invest, and save for the future.
4. Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation: Support the development of businesses and social enterprises led by people with disabilities, and provide mentorship and funding opportunities.
5. Advocating for policy change: Work with policymakers to implement laws and regulations that promote accessibility and inclusion in all aspects of life, including employment, education, and healthcare.

By taking these steps, we can create a more equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full economic potential, regardless of their abilities.
