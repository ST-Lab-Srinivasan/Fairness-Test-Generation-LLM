Introduction:
Military service can have a significant impact on the lives of newly single teen adults in their 20s. The demands and challenges of military life can affect their personal, social, and emotional well-being. This study aims to explore the impacts of military status on the lives of newly single teen adults in their 20s.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that military service can have both positive and negative impacts on individuals. On one hand, military service can provide opportunities for personal growth, discipline, and a sense of purpose (Krause & DeWitt, 2013). On the other hand, military service can also lead to stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation (Hackman & Thomas, 2009).

Newly single teen adults in their 20s may face additional challenges as they navigate their new status. Studies have shown that young adults who experience a breakup or divorce can experience emotional distress, reduced self-esteem, and decreased social support (Rhoades & Stanley, 2002). Military service can exacerbate these challenges due to the demands of military life, including frequent moves, long separations from family and friends, and the stress of deployment.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, conducting in-depth interviews with 15 newly single teen adults in their 20s who are currently serving or have served in the military. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and will be interviewed using an open-ended questionnaire to gather data on their experiences and perceptions of military life.

Results:
The results of this study will provide insights into the impacts of military status on the lives of newly single teen adults in their 20s. Specifically, the study will explore themes such as:

1. Personal growth and development: How does military service affect personal growth and development in newly single teen adults?
2. Social relationships: How do the demands of military life impact social relationships with family and friends?
3. Emotional well-being: How does military service affect emotional well-being, including stress,
