1. Develop a tailored curriculum: Create a curriculum that is specifically designed for beginners who are not in a relationship. This can include topics such as basic vocabulary, grammar, and cultural norms that are relevant to this group of learners.
2. Use diverse teaching methods: Use a variety of teaching methods to cater to different learning styles. For example, you can use visual aids, audio recordings, and interactive activities to engage learners who have different preferences.
3. Provide individualized attention: Give individualized attention to each learner to ensure that their needs are met. This can be done through one-on-one instruction or small group classes where each student receives personalized feedback and support.
