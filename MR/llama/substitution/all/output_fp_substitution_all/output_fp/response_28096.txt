Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are not recently widowed individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make your programs more welcoming and accessible:

1. Offer flexible class schedules: Accommodate the diverse schedules of your students by offering classes at different times, such as evenings or weekends. This will allow working professionals or those with family commitments to participate more easily.
2. Provide childcare options: Offer on-site childcare services or partner with local daycares to provide care for children during class hours. This will enable parents to focus on their language learning without worrying about their kids' safety and well-being.
3. Adapt teaching methods: Use a variety of teaching methods, such as visual aids, multimedia presentations, and interactive games, to cater to different learning styles and preferences. This will help keep beginner Arabic speakers engaged and motivated.
