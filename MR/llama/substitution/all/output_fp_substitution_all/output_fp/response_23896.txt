To highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish speakers, you can use data to identify common challenges and trends. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Analysis of language learning progress: Use data to track the progress of beginner Spanish learners over time. This could include analyzing their proficiency levels, understanding of grammar rules, and vocabulary acquisition. By examining these metrics, you can identify areas where students struggle the most.
2. Identification of common mistakes: Collect and analyze data on common errors made by beginner Spanish speakers. This could include common grammatical mistakes, pronunciation issues, or difficulties with sentence structure. By identifying these patterns, you can tailor your teaching methods to address these areas of struggle.
3. Survey research: Conduct surveys to gather information from beginner Spanish learners about their experiences and challenges. This could include questions about their learning goals, motivation levels, and obstacles they face in the learning process. The data collected from surveys can help you understand the perspectives of your students and design more effective teaching methods.
4. Corpus analysis: Use corpus linguistics to analyze large datasets of written Spanish text. By examining patterns of language use, you can identify common issues faced by beginner Spanish speakers, such as difficulty with sentence structure or vocabulary choice. This data can help you develop more effective teaching methods and materials.
5. Observational research: Conduct observational research to study the language learning behaviors of beginner Spanish learners in real-time. This could involve observing students in a language classroom setting, noting their interactions and mistakes, and analyzing the data to identify common issues. By understanding how students interact with each other and with the language, you can tailor your teaching methods to address these issues.
6. Case studies: Conduct case studies of individual beginner Spanish learners to gather detailed information about their language learning experiences. This could involve collecting data on their language use, grammar mistakes, and vocabulary acquisition over a period of time. By analyzing these case studies, you can identify common issues faced by beginner Spanish speakers and develop targeted teaching methods to address these challenges.
7. Comparative analysis: Compare the language learning experiences of beginner Spanish learners in different contexts, such as classroom settings or online language courses. By
