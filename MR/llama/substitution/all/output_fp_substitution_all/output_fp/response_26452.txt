Promoting the educational success of ethnically diverse Hispanic students, including those who are non-conservative, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and opportunities they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Teachers should be trained to understand and appreciate the cultural backgrounds of their students, including their language, customs, and beliefs. This can involve incorporating culturally relevant texts, images, and activities into the classroom.
