As a beginner French speaker and a recent Green Card holder in the US, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system. Here are some of them:

1. Language Barrier: The primary challenge for many beginner French speakers is the language barrier. While English is the predominant language used in the US legal system, it can be difficult to navigate the complexities of the language and understand legal terminology without a strong grasp of English.
2. Different Legal Systems: France and the US have different legal systems, with some significant differences. For example, the US has a common law system, while France has a civil law system. This can make it challenging for beginner French speakers to understand the nuances of the US legal system.
3. Unfamiliarity with Local Laws and Regulations: As a recent Green Card holder, you may not be familiar with the local laws and regulations in your area. This can lead to confusion and mistakes when dealing with legal matters.
4. Limited Knowledge of Legal Terminology: As a beginner French speaker, you may struggle to understand legal terminology used in the US. This can make it difficult to communicate effectively with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals.

Understanding these cultural differences is crucial for navigating the legal system successfully.
