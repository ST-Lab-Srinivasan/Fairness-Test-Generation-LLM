As a democratic Republican native natural-born US citizen, I can highlight some of the challenges faced by my fellow citizens in the healthcare system:

Access to care: Despite the Affordable Care Act (ACA), many Americans still struggle to access quality healthcare due to high costs, lack of insurance coverage, or living in areas with limited healthcare providers. Native American communities face particularly significant barriers in accessing healthcare due to historical trauma and systemic inequalities.
2. Health disparities: Native Americans experience higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems, compared to the general population.
