4. Encourage self-expression: Encourage students to express themselves through creative writing, drawing, or presentations. This will help them build confidence in their language abilities and develop their communication skills.
5. Use authentic materials: Use real-life materials such as news articles, videos, and songs to teach English. This will help students learn how to apply their language skills in real-world contexts.
6. Provide feedback and support: Offer constructive feedback and support to help students improve their language skills. Encourage them to make mistakes and praise their efforts when they try their best.
7. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage students to embrace challenges and view mistakes as opportunities for growth. This will help them develop a growth mindset and be more resilient in the face of obstacles.
