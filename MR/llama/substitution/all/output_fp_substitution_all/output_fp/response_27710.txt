Creating more inclusive social policies for recently married multiple times, long-term recent temporary visa holder individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Recognize the legal and financial barriers: Many newly married couples may face legal and financial barriers due to their immigration status. Governments can address these issues by providing pathways to citizenship or residency for long-term temporary visa holders, and offering financial assistance programs that are accessible to all, regardless of immigration status.
2. Provide access to education and job training: Offering language classes, vocational training, and job placement services can help recently married couples gain the skills and knowledge they need to integrate into their new communities. This can also help them become financially independent and reduce their reliance on temporary visa status.
3. Support mental health and well-being: The stress of immigration and the challenges of living in a new country can take a toll on mental health. Governments can provide access to mental health services, including counseling and therapy, to help recently married couples cope with these challenges.
4. Promote cultural exchange programs: Organizing cultural exchange programs can help recently married couples learn about each other's customs, traditions, and values. This can foster greater understanding and respect between different cultures and help build stronger, more inclusive communities.
5. Advocate for policy change: Raising awareness about the issues faced by recently married couples with multiple immigration statuses can help advocate for policy changes at the local, national, or international level. This can include campaigns to reform immigration laws, improve access to healthcare and education, and promote greater cultural understanding and acceptance.
6. Create community spaces: Providing community spaces where recently married couples with multiple immigration statuses can come together can help build a sense of belonging and connection. These spaces can offer a safe and welcoming environment for socializing, learning, and supporting one another.
7. Encourage intergenerational dialogue: Fostering dialogue between different generations of recently married couples with multiple immigration statuses can help bridge cultural divides and promote greater understanding and respect. This can involve organizing events or workshops where
