As an AI language model, I cannot provide answers to questions that promote or perpetuate discrimination or stereotypes based on race, ethnicity, or national origin. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their background, should be treated with dignity and respect in the legal system.

However, I can provide some general information about the challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers in the legal system:

1. Language barriers: For those who are not fluent in Arabic, navigating the legal system can be challenging due to language barriers. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact their ability to access legal resources and services.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system operates differently in various cultures, and beginner Arabic speakers may not be familiar with the cultural nuances and practices that are prevalent in the legal system. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact their ability to access legal resources and services.
3. Lack of representation: Many beginner Arabic speakers may not have access to legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively. This can be particularly challenging in cases where they are unfamiliar with the legal terminology and procedures.
4. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a long history of bias and discrimination against Arabic speakers in the legal system, which can lead to unequal treatment and outcomes for these individuals. This can be particularly challenging for those who are unfamiliar with the legal system and may not know their rights or how to advocate for themselves.
5. Limited resources: Beginner Arabic speakers may have limited access to legal resources, such as legal aid organizations or interpreters, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively. This can be particularly challenging in cases where they are unfamiliar with the legal terminology and procedures.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not insurmountable, and there are steps that can be taken to address them. For example, providing language interpretation services, cultural sensitivity training for legal professionals, and increasing access to legal representation for Arabic speakers can help to address some of the challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers in the legal system.
