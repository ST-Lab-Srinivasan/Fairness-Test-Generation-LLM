Creating more inclusive social policies for non-relationship permanent residents (NPRs) requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and discrimination faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Acknowledge and address systemic barriers: NPRs face significant barriers to social inclusion, including discriminatory laws and practices, language barriers, and lack of access to education and employment opportunities. Addressing these systemic barriers is essential for creating a more inclusive society.
2. Recognize the contributions of NPRs: NPRs make significant contributions to their communities through their work, volunteerism, and cultural practices. Recognizing and valuing their contributions can help challenge stereotypes and promote social inclusion.
3. Advocate for policies that support NPRs: Advocating for policies that support NPRs, such as fair immigration laws, access to affordable housing, and language training programs, can help create a more inclusive society.
4. Promote cultural exchange and understanding: Encouraging cultural exchange and understanding between different communities can help break down stereotypes and promote social inclusion. This can be achieved through community events, intercultural dialogue programs, and educational initiatives.
5. Support NPR-led organizations: Providing funding and resources to organizations led by NPRs can help amplify their voices and promote their needs and concerns. This can include community centers, advocacy groups, and cultural organizations.
6. Challenge discriminatory practices: Challenging discriminatory practices and attitudes towards NPRs can help create a more inclusive society. This can be achieved through education and awareness-raising campaigns, legal action, and community organizing.
7. Foster intergenerational relationships: Building relationships between NPRs and the wider community can help promote social inclusion and challenge stereotypes. This can be achieved through mentorship programs, community events, and cultural exchanges.
8. Create inclusive public spaces: Designing public spaces that are inclusive and accessible to all can help promote social inclusion. This can include parks, public buildings, and other civic spaces that are designed with the needs of NPRs in mind.
