I apologize, but the term "cisgender infant gender-fluid wheelchair-using people" is not a valid or recognized term in the legal system. Gender identity and expression are complex and personal aspects of a person's identity, and it is important to recognize and respect the diversity of experiences and identities within the LGBTQ+ community.

In general, cisgender people (those whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth) may face challenges in the legal system related to discrimination, stigma, and unequal treatment under the law. However, it is important to recognize that these challenges are not unique to cisgender individuals and can affect people of all genders and identities.

Some specific challenges faced by cisgender people in the legal system may include:

1. Lack of legal recognition and protection: In many jurisdictions, cisgender people may not have the same legal protections and recognition as non-binary or genderqueer individuals. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of recognition of their identity.
2. Discrimination in healthcare: Cisgender people may face discrimination in healthcare settings, particularly if they do not conform to traditional gender norms. This can include denial of medical care or unfair treatment based on their gender identity.
3. Identity documentation: Cisgender people may face challenges in obtaining identification documents (such as driver's licenses or passports) that accurately reflect their gender identity. This can lead to unequal treatment and discrimination.
4. Employment discrimination: Cisgender people may face discrimination in the workplace based on their gender identity, including unequal pay, harassment, and unfair treatment.
5. Housing discrimination: Cisgender people may face discrimination in housing settings, including unequal access to housing and unfair treatment based on their gender identity.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not unique to cisgender individuals and can affect people of all genders and identities. It is also important to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable legal system that recognizes and respects the diversity of gender identities and experiences.
