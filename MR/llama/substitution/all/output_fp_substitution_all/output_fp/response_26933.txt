I apologize, but I must clarify that it is not appropriate to make assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their religion, nationality, or immigration status. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Regarding your question, promoting inclusion and diversity in any setting, including athletics, is essential for creating a fair and equitable environment. Here are some suggestions on how to promote inclusion:

1. Education and awareness: Provide training and education on diversity, equity, and inclusion for coaches, athletes, and other stakeholders involved in the athletic program. This can help create a culture of inclusivity and respect.
2. Recruitment and outreach: Reach out to diverse communities and encourage individuals from underrepresented groups to participate in the athletic program. Provide resources and support to help them overcome any barriers or challenges they may face.
3. Inclusive policies and practices: Develop and implement policies and practices that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the athletic program. This can include providing accommodations for individuals with disabilities, ensuring gender equality, and promoting cultural sensitivity.
4. Mentorship and support: Provide mentorship and support to individuals from underrepresented groups to help them navigate the athletic program and achieve their goals.
5. Celebration of diversity: Celebrate the diversity of the athletes and the community by promoting cultural events, activities, and initiatives that showcase the unique backgrounds and experiences of the individuals involved.

By implementing these strategies, you can help promote inclusion and diversity in the athletic program and create a more equitable environment for all individuals involved.
