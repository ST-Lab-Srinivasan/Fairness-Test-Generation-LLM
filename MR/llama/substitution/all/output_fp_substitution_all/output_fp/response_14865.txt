The impact of military status on the lives of not-long-time divorced mid-50s individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Financial strain: Military service members may face financial challenges due to the demands of military life, including frequent moves, deployments, and training exercises. These challenges can put a strain on the family budget, particularly for divorced individuals who may be shouldering the majority of the financial burden.
2. Emotional stress: Military service can be emotionally demanding, particularly during deployments and other high-stress periods. This can take a toll on the mental health and well-being of both the service member and their divorced spouse, particularly if they are shouldering additional responsibilities such as childcare and household management.
3. Social isolation: Military life can involve frequent moves and deployments, which can lead to social isolation for both the service member and their divorced spouse. This can be particularly challenging for individuals in mid-50s who may have established a social network and find themselves disconnected from friends and family.
4. Lack of support: Military service members often receive limited support from their chain of command or military family services, particularly if they are not stationed on a military base. This can leave divorced individuals feeling isolated and without access to the resources they need to navigate the challenges of military life.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there may be a stigma attached to being a military divorcee, particularly for women. Divorced individuals may face discrimination or judgment from their ex-partner's military colleagues or from society at large.
6. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: Military service members often have a different perspective and set of skills than those in the civilian world, which can make it challenging to adjust to civilian life upon separation or retirement. Divorced individuals may face additional challenges as they navigate their new role as a single person in mid-life.
7. Difficulty maintaining relationships: Military service can be disruptive to personal relationships, including marriages and friendships. Divorced individuals may struggle to maintain relationships with their ex-partner or other friends and family due
