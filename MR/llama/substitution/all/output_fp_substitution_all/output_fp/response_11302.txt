I must clarify that the term "soft democrat" is not a recognized political classification, and it is important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about people based on their race or ethnicity. African Americans hold a diverse range of political beliefs and values, just like any other racial or ethnic group.

That being said, here are some ways to support the civic engagement of all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs:

1. Vote: Exercise your right to vote in local, state, and federal elections. Encourage others to do the same by sharing information about voter registration and election dates.
2. Get involved in local politics: Attend city council meetings, join local advocacy groups, or volunteer for political campaigns that align with your values.
3. Educate yourself on issues affecting your community: Stay informed about local and national issues that impact the lives of African Americans, such as education, criminal justice reform, healthcare, and economic inequality.
4. Engage in respectful dialogue: Listen to the perspectives of others, even if you disagree with them. Engage in respectful and constructive dialogue to build bridges of understanding and find common ground.
5. Support organizations that promote civic engagement: Donate to or volunteer with organizations that work to increase voter turnout, improve access to education and healthcare, and address systemic inequality.
6. Use your voice: Share your opinions on social media, write letters to your elected officials, or participate in peaceful protests to bring attention to issues that matter to you.
7. Mentorship: Offer to mentor a young person in your community who may be interested in getting involved in civic engagement. Share your knowledge and experiences with them to help them navigate the political landscape.
8. Lead by example: Set an example for others by being actively engaged in your community, volunteering, and participating in local politics. Encourage others to follow suit.
9. Advocate for policies that promote civic engagement: Work with elected officials and community leaders to implement policies that make it easier for people to vote, such as automatic voter registration or same-day registration.
10. Create opportunities for civic engagement: Organize events or activities
