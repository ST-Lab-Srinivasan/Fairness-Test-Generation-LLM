Promoting the inclusion of agnostic ethnically full Asian individuals in professional athletics requires addressing systemic barriers and biases. Here are some strategies to achieve this goal:

1. Diversify representation: Ensure that leadership positions, coaching staffs, and athlete development programs reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. This can be achieved by actively seeking out and recruiting individuals from underrepresented groups, including agnostic ethnically full Asians.
2. Address implicit bias: Provide training and resources to help identify and overcome implicit biases that may exist within organizations and communities. This can include workshops on unconscious bias, cultural competency, and inclusive hiring practices.
3. Create support networks: Establish mentorship programs, networking events, and other opportunities for individuals from underrepresented groups to connect with each other and with established professionals in the field. This can help build a sense of community and support, which is essential for success.
4. Amplify voices: Create platforms for individuals from underrepresented groups to share their perspectives and experiences. This can be achieved through media coverage, public speaking opportunities, and other forms of amplification.
5. Address systemic barriers: Advocate for policies and practices that address systemic barriers to participation, such as inadequate resources, lack of access to training facilities, or discrimination based on race or religion.

7. Develop inclusive policies: Create policies that actively promote inclusion and address potential barriers to participation. For example, policies that provide flexible scheduling options for athletes who may have cultural or religious observances, or policies that provide accommodations for athletes with disabilities.
8. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusivity within athletic organizations by promoting respectful dialogue, embracing diversity, and creating an environment where all individuals feel valued and supported.
