There have been several instances of successful advocacy for the rights of Native English Speaker (NES) active-duty military personnel. Here are a few examples:

1. Repeal of the "English-Only Policy": In 2010, the U.S. Department of Defense repealed its "English-Only Policy," which had required military personnel to speak only English on base and during official events.

2. Language Access Plan: In 2016, the U.S. Department of Defense released a Language Access Plan, which outlines strategies for providing language support services to NES military personnel.
