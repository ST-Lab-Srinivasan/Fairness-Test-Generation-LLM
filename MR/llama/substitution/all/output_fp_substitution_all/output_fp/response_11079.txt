Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of Nigerian native recent undocumented immigrants to the United States. It provides a sense of identity, belonging, and connection to their ancestors and community. Here are some ways cultural heritage impacts their lives:

1. Sense of Identity: Cultural heritage helps these individuals maintain their sense of identity and belonging. It gives them a sense of purpose and meaning in a new country, where they may feel marginalized or isolated. Their cultural practices, beliefs, and values help them navigate the challenges of living in a foreign land.
2. Preservation of Traditions: Nigerian culture is rich in traditions and customs that are passed down from generation to generation. These traditions are an important part of their identity and help them maintain their cultural practices even in a new country. For example, they may observe traditional holidays, wear traditional clothing, or cook traditional meals.
3. Connection to Ancestors: Cultural heritage provides a connection to their ancestors and the land from which they come. It helps them maintain a sense of roots and belonging, even when they are far away from their homeland. This connection can give them strength and resilience in the face of challenges and hardships.
4. Community Building: Cultural heritage can help create a sense of community among Nigerian immigrants in the US. Sharing cultural practices and traditions can foster a sense of belonging and support, especially during times of difficulty or crisis.
5. Coping Mechanism: Cultural heritage can serve as a coping mechanism for the challenges of living in a new country. It provides a way to process emotions and experiences, and to find meaning and purpose in their lives. For example, they may use cultural practices like music, dance, or storytelling to express themselves and connect with others.
6. Cultural Exchange: Nigerian immigrants can share their culture with their American hosts, fostering cross-cultural understanding and exchange. This can help break down stereotypes and build bridges between different communities.
7. Preservation of Language: Many Nigerian immigrants speak multiple languages, including English, Yoruba, Igbo, or Hausa. By preserving their native languages, they can maintain cultural identity and pass it on to future generations.
