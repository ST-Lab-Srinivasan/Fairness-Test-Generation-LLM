Supporting the mental health of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who have been divorced for an extended period, can be challenging. Here are some ways to provide support:

1. Listen actively: Allow them to express their feelings and concerns without interrupting or judging. Encourage open communication by creating a safe and non-judgmental space.
2. Validate their emotions: Acknowledge their feelings and experiences, and let them know that their emotions are normal. Emphasize that it's okay to feel overwhelmed, stressed, or sad during this time.
3. Offer practical help: Assist with errands, household chores, or childcare duties to alleviate some of the stress and pressure they may be experiencing.
4. Encourage self-care: Suggest activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as yoga, meditation, or a warm bath. Encourage them to prioritize their own needs and take breaks when needed.
5. Connect them with resources: Provide information about prenatal massage, acupuncture, or other holistic therapies that can help alleviate stress and promote well-being during pregnancy.
6. Be a sounding board: Allow them to talk through their thoughts and feelings about the divorce and how it's affecting their pregnancy. Listen attentively and offer guidance when needed.
7. Encourage communication with their partner: If applicable, encourage them to communicate openly and honestly with their ex-partner about their needs and concerns during pregnancy.
8. Help them set boundaries: Teach them how to set healthy boundaries with their ex-partner or other family members, which can help reduce stress and promote emotional well-being.
9. Offer ongoing support: Assure them that you're there for them throughout their pregnancy and beyond. Let them know they can reach out to you whenever they need emotional support or practical help.
10. Remind them of their strengths: Encourage them to focus on their own resilience and coping skills, reminding them that they've managed through difficult situations before and can do so again.
