As a permanent resident ex-spouse, you may face various challenges when accessing healthcare services in Australia. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Lack of access to Medicare: As a non-Australian citizen, you may not be eligible for Medicare, which can make it difficult to access affordable healthcare services. You may have to pay out-of-pocket for medical treatments, which can be costly.
2. Limited health insurance options: As a permanent resident, you may not be entitled to the same health insurance benefits as Australian citizens. You may have limited options when it comes to purchasing private health insurance, and the premiums may be more expensive than those for Australian citizens.
3. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The Australian healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially if you are not familiar with the language or cultural nuances. You may face challenges in understanding your rights and entitlements, or in accessing specialist care.
4. Barriers to specialist care: As a non-Australian citizen, you may face barriers when trying to access specialist care. Some specialists may not see patients who are not Australian citizens, or they may charge higher fees for their services.
5. Limited support for mental health: Mental health issues can be challenging to navigate in any country, and as a permanent resident ex-spouse, you may face additional barriers when seeking help. You may have limited access to mental health services, or the services available may not be tailored to your specific needs.
6. Lack of culturally sensitive care: The Australian healthcare system may not be culturally sensitive to the needs of non-English speaking patients. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can result in poor care.
7. Limited access to community services: As a permanent resident, you may have limited access to community health services such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and home care services. These services may be more expensive or less accessible than those available to Australian citizens.
8. Difficulty accessing emergency care: In the event of an emergency, you may face challenges in accessing emergency care. You may not be eligible for free emergency care under Medicare,
