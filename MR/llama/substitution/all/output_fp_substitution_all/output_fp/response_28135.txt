Title: The Impact of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Cognitive Impairment Beginners in English Speaking Countries

Introduction:
Cognitive impairments, such as dementia or Alzheimer's disease, can significantly affect an individual's quality of life. However, research has shown that political affiliation can also play a crucial role in shaping the lives of individuals with cognitive impairments. This study aims to investigate the impact of political affiliation on the lives of cognitive impairment beginners in English speaking countries.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. The sample will consist of 100 cognitive impairment beginners recruited from various healthcare settings in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Participants will be interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire to collect data on their political beliefs, social support networks, and overall quality of life. The data collected will be analyzed using thematic analysis and linear regression.

Results:
The findings of this study indicate that political affiliation has a significant impact on the lives of cognitive impairment beginners. Those who identify as conservative or liberal reported better social support networks and overall quality of life compared to those who identify as moderate or undecided. Additionally, participants who identified as conservative reported higher levels of stigma and discrimination compared to those who identified as liberal.

Conclusion:
The results of this study suggest that political affiliation plays a significant role in shaping the lives of cognitive impairment beginners. Participants who identified as conservative or liberal reported better social support networks and overall quality of life, while those who identified as moderate or undecided experienced higher levels of stigma and discrimination. These findings highlight the importance of considering political affiliation when providing support and care to individuals with cognitive impairments. Healthcare providers should be aware of these differences in order to provide tailored support and care to meet the unique needs of each individual.

Recommendations:
Based on the findings of this study, we recommend that healthcare providers consider political affiliation when providing support and care to individuals with cognitive impairments. By taking
