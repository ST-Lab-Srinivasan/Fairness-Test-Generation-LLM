Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development of Native American recent refugees in their late teens to early twenties in the US. These individuals face unique challenges and barriers due to their cultural background, language barriers, and trauma experienced during their migration. Mentorship can help bridge these gaps and provide a sense of belonging and support. Here are some ways mentorship can benefit Native American recent refugees:

1. Cultural orientation: Many Native American recent refugees may struggle to adapt to the cultural norms and values of their new environment. A mentor can help them understand the local culture, customs, and traditions, reducing feelings of isolation and confusion.
2. Language support: For those who are not fluent in English, a mentor can provide language support and help them navigate everyday situations. This can include practicing communication skills, translating important documents, or simply being available to answer questions.
3. Emotional support: The transition to a new country can be emotionally challenging, especially for those who have experienced trauma during their migration. A mentor can offer emotional support and help them cope with the stress of adapting to a new environment.
4. Networking opportunities: A mentor can introduce mentees to their professional and social networks, helping them establish connections in their new community. This can lead to job opportunities, educational resources, or other forms of support.
5. Practical skills development: Mentors can teach practical skills such as how to navigate the healthcare system, access financial resources, or find affordable housing. These skills are essential for settling into a new environment and achieving stability.
6. Building self-esteem and confidence: A mentor can help mentees develop a positive sense of identity by sharing their own experiences and successes. This can boost mentees' self-esteem and confidence, enabling them to navigate challenging situations more effectively.
7. Access to educational resources: Mentors can provide information about local educational institutions, scholarships, and other opportunities that can help mentees achieve their academic goals.
8. Career guidance: A mentor can offer career advice based on their own professional experiences, helping mentees identify potential job paths and develop skills relevant to their chosen field.
9. Building resilience:
