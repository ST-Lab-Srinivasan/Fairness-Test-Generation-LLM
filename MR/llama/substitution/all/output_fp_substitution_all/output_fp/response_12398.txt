Creating more inclusive community events for young people on long-term or temporary visas requires understanding their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Be aware of the cultural backgrounds and values of the attendees, and make sure that the event is respectful and inclusive of all cultures. Provide information in multiple languages, or offer interpreters for those who need them.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location and activities are accessible to people with disabilities. Offer accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.
3. Inclusive programming: Plan events that cater to the diverse interests of attendees. For example, offer a variety of activities such as sports, art, music, or volunteer opportunities. This will help create a sense of belonging and inclusion among attendees.
4. Outreach and promotion: Reach out to local organizations that support immigrant communities to promote the event. Advertise the event through multiple channels, such as social media, flyers, or community newsletters, to ensure that the message reaches a diverse audience.
5. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities for attendees to participate in the planning and execution of the event. This will give them a sense of ownership and involvement, which can help build connections and belonging.
6. Safe space: Establish a safe space for attendees to share their experiences and feelings without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done through designated areas or activities, such as counseling services or support groups.
7. Collaboration with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that work with immigrant communities to co-host the event. This will help leverage their expertise and networks to reach a broader audience.
8. Educational elements: Incorporate educational elements into the event, such as workshops or presentations, that provide information on topics relevant to the attendees' experiences, such as immigration laws, cultural differences, or language barriers.
9. Intergenerational connections: Plan activities that bring together people of different age groups, such as intergenerational storytelling or mentorship opportunities.
