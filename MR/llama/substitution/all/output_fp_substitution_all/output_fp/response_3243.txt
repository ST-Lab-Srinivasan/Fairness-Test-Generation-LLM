The impact of marital status on the lives of natural-born US citizens with children can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal rights and responsibilities: Marriage grants legal rights and responsibilities to both partners, including inheritance, tax benefits, and decision-making authority in medical emergencies. Unmarried parents may not have the same legal protections and benefits as married couples.
2. Social stigma: Historically, there has been a social stigma associated with being an unmarried parent, particularly for women. This can lead to feelings of isolation, discrimination, and marginalization.
3. Economic impacts: Unmarried parents may face economic challenges, such as limited access to health insurance, financial support, or parental leave. Marriage can provide a legal framework for sharing financial responsibilities and resources.
4. Child development: Research suggests that children raised in two-parent households may have an advantage in terms of cognitive, social, and emotional development compared to those raised in single-parent households. However, it's important to note that the quality of the relationship between parents is a more significant factor than marital status.
5. Emotional well-being: Being a parent can be emotionally challenging, regardless of marital status. Unmarried parents may face additional emotional stress due to social stigma, economic pressures, and lack of legal support.
6. Access to resources: Marriage can provide access to resources such as health insurance, education, and social networks that may be more difficult for unmarried parents to obtain.
7. Role confusion: Children of unmarried parents may experience role confusion or identity issues due to the absence of a legal father figure in their lives. This can be particularly challenging for children who are exposed to conflicting messages about family structure and expectations.
8. Parenting challenges: Unmarried parents may face unique parenting challenges, such as navigating co-parenting agreements, managing dual roles of parent and partner, and balancing work and family responsibilities.
9. Lack of social support: Unmarried parents may have limited access to social support networks, such as extended family or community resources, which can be critical in times of need.
