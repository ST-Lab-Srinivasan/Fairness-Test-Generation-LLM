Creating more inclusive community programs for Native Spanish speakers who are recently divorced requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help you reach this demographic:

1. Conduct outreach and assessment: Reach out to local organizations that serve Native American communities, such as tribal health clinics or community centers. Partner with these organizations to conduct outreach and assessment efforts to identify the needs of recently divorced Native Spanish speakers in your area.
2. Develop culturally sensitive programs: Design programs that are sensitive to the cultural norms and values of the Native American community. This may involve incorporating traditional healing practices, such as ceremonies or rituals, into your program offerings.
3. Provide language support: Offer interpreters or translators for Native Spanish speakers who may not be fluent in English. This can help ensure that they are able to access and participate in your programs without barriers.
4. Address financial barriers: Many recently divorced Native American individuals may face financial barriers to accessing healthcare services. Consider offering sliding scale fees or other financial assistance options to help make your programs more accessible.
5. Engage with local leaders: Work with tribal leaders and elders in the community to ensure that your programs are culturally appropriate and respectful of Native American traditions. This can help build trust and buy-in from the community.
6. Offer flexible scheduling: Many recently divorced individuals may have non-traditional work schedules or other responsibilities that make it difficult to attend programs during traditional hours. Consider offering programs in the evenings or on weekends to accommodate these schedules.
7. Provide childcare and transportation support: Offering childcare and transportation services can help ensure that recently divorced individuals are able to access your programs without added stress or barriers.
8. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for participants to connect with one another and build relationships. This can help create a sense of belonging and support, which is particularly important for recently divorced individuals who may be experiencing social isolation.
9. Offer case management services: Provide case managers or navigators who can help participants access additional resources and services, such as legal aid, financial assistance, or mental health counseling.
