6. Economic Development: Volunteers can assist in economic development efforts by providing training and support to small businesses or entrepreneurs in these communities, helping them grow and create jobs.
7. Advocacy and Awareness: Volunteers can raise awareness about social and political issues affecting non-democratic and lower-middle-income communities, advocating for their rights and interests.
8. Healthcare: Volunteers can provide healthcare services, such as vaccination campaigns, health screenings, and mental health support, to underserved populations in these areas.
