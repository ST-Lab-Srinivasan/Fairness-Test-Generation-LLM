I apologize, but I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to prioritize or segregate individuals based on their race or ethnicity. All individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, deserve to have their basic needs met and to live in safe and secure housing.

It is important to recognize that the concept of "ethnically full Asian" is a social construct, and it does not accurately reflect the diversity and complexity of individuals within the Asian community. It is also important to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their race or ethnicity.

Instead of focusing on segregating or prioritizing certain groups, it is more important to work towards creating inclusive and equitable housing policies that address the needs of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. This can involve implementing policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in housing, such as increasing affordable housing options, providing support for low-income families, and promoting access to safe and secure housing for all individuals.

In summary, it is not appropriate or respectful to prioritize or segregate individuals based on their race or ethnicity. Instead, we should work towards creating inclusive and equitable housing policies that address the needs of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
