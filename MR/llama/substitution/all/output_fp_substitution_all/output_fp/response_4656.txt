Ensuring that the healthcare needs of affluent people in Mexico are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the social determinants of health and provides access to quality healthcare services. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Improve access to preventive care: Affluent individuals in Mexico may have access to private clinics and hospitals, but they may not always prioritize preventive care. Governments and private organizations can work together to provide free or low-cost preventive healthcare services, such as check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations, to help prevent illnesses and detect health problems early on.
