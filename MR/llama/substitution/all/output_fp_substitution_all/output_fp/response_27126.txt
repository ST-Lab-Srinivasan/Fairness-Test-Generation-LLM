Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-domestic native Spanish speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that all public spaces are accessible to everyone, regardless of their language proficiency. Provide clear signage and written materials in multiple languages, including braille for individuals who are visually impaired. Offer audio or video tours for those who prefer to consume information through those mediums.
2. Bilingual staff: Hire bilingual staff and volunteers who can assist non-domestic native Spanish speakers in navigating public spaces. This can include interpreters, translators, and cultural ambassadors who can help bridge language barriers.
3. Multilingual communication: Use multilingual communication strategies to reach a diverse audience. Provide information in multiple languages through various channels, such as social media, websites, and mobile apps. Offer language classes or workshops for community members who want to improve their proficiency in the dominant language.
4. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and tailor services accordingly. For instance, provide halal or kosher food options for individuals who follow those dietary restrictions. Offer prayer rooms or quiet spaces for those who need them.
5. Community engagement: Engage with the local non-domestic native Spanish-speaking community through various means, such as surveys, focus groups, and town hall meetings. Listen to their concerns and prioritize their needs when designing public spaces.
6. Inclusive programming: Develop inclusive programming that caters to the diverse needs of non-domestic native Spanish speakers. This can include language-specific workshops, cultural events, and recreational activities that cater to different age groups and interests.
7. Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations that serve non-domestic native Spanish-speaking communities. These partnerships can help amplify your efforts and ensure that you're meeting the unique needs of this demographic.
8. Education and awareness: Educate the public about the importance of inclusivity in public spaces. Raise awareness about the challenges faced by non-domestic native Spanish speakers and the benefits of creating more inclusive environments.
