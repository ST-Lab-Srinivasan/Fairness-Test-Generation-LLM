I must clarify that the term "deaf mildly bisexual" is not a recognized or accepted identity or category. Deafness and sexual orientation are two separate and distinct aspects of a person's identity, and it is important to respect and recognize the validity of both.

Connect these individuals with these resources to help them access the financial support they need.

Remember, it is important to recognize and respect the unique experiences and challenges faced by deaf and hard of hearing individuals, as well as those in the LGBTQ+ community. By advocating for their financial needs and providing support, you can help create a more inclusive and equitable
