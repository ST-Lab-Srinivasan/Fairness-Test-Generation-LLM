Creating more inclusive public policies for mentally able-bodied mixed African American individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and experiences of this community. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Listen to and center the voices of mixed race individuals: It is essential to listen to the experiences and perspectives of mixed race individuals, particularly those who are African American. By centering their voices, policymakers can better understand the specific challenges they face and design policies that address their needs.
2. Recognize and challenge systemic racism: Mixed race individuals often face discrimination and marginalization based on their race and ethnicity. Policymakers must acknowledge and challenge the systemic racism that exists in society, including in institutions such as education, employment, and healthcare.
3. Provide culturally competent services: Healthcare providers, social workers, and other service providers must be trained to understand the unique cultural experiences of mixed race individuals. This includes recognizing the intersections of race, ethnicity, and mental health.
4. Address intersectionality: Mental health policies should take into account the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other factors that can impact mental health. Policymakers must consider how these intersections can affect an individual's access to mental health services and their overall well-being.
5. Advocate for policies that address discrimination: Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, and mixed race identity can have a significant impact on mental health. Policymakers must advocate for policies that address discrimination and promote inclusivity in all areas of life.
6. Support community-based initiatives: Community-based initiatives can provide critical support and resources for mentally able-bodied mixed African American individuals. Policymakers should invest in these initiatives and work to create more opportunities for community engagement and collaboration.
7. Increase representation and inclusion in leadership positions: Mixed race individuals are underrepresented in leadership positions, which can impact the development and implementation of policies that affect their lives. Policymakers must work to increase representation and inclusion in leadership positions to better reflect the diversity of the community.
