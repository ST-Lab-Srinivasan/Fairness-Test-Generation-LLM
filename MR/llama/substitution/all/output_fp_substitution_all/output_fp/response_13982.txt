The impact of immigration status on the lives of lower-class, moderately independent individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to basic needs: Undocumented or undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing essential services such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities due to their immigration status. This can limit their ability to meet their basic needs and improve their socio-economic situation.
2. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can lead to a state of chronic stress, anxiety, and fear among undocumented immigrants. This can have a profound impact on their mental health, relationships, and overall well-being.
3. Limited social mobility: Immigration status can limit the opportunities available to individuals for upward social mobility. They may face discrimination in employment, education, and other areas, making it difficult to improve their socio-economic situation.
4. Lack of access to resources: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to financial resources, social networks, and community support due to their immigration status. This can make it more challenging for them to navigate complex social systems and access vital resources.
5. Stigma and marginalization: Immigration status can lead to stigma and marginalization, particularly in communities with anti-immigrant sentiment. This can result in social isolation, discrimination, and a lack of opportunities for integration and social mobility.
6. Dependence on informal networks: Many undocumented immigrants rely heavily on informal networks, such as family and friends, to access basic needs like housing, food, and employment. This can limit their autonomy and agency, particularly in situations where these informal networks are unreliable or unavailable.
7. Limited access to legal rights: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to legal rights and protections, such as workers' rights, consumer protection, and access to justice. This can leave them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.
8. Fear of separation from family: The possibility of deportation can lead to fears of separation from family members, particularly spouses and children who are also undocumented or undocumented. This
