7. Community-based initiatives: Support community-based initiatives that promote social inclusion, such as language classes, cultural events, and mentorship programs.
8. Collaboration with government agencies: Work with government agencies to develop and implement policies that promote the social inclusion of these communities.
9. Capacity building: Build the capacity of community leaders and members to advocate for their rights and participate in decision-making processes.
