3. Personalized guidance: A mentor can offer personalized advice and support based on their own experiences, helping individuals in poverty make informed decisions about their lives and careers.
4. Confidence building: Mentorship can help build an individual's self-confidence and self-esteem, which is essential for overcoming the challenges of poverty.
5. Emotional support: A mentor can provide emotional support during difficult times, helping individuals in poverty cope with stress and hardship.
6. Skill development: A mentor can help an individual in poverty develop new skills or improve existing ones, increasing their employability and earning potential.
