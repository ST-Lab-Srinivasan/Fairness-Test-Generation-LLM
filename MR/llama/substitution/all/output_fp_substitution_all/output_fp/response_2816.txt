Long-term recent refugee devout Hindu people may face several challenges in the legal system, particularly when it comes to navigating cultural and religious differences. Here are some of the challenges they may encounter:

1. Lack of understanding of Hindu laws and practices: The legal system may not be familiar with the intricacies of Hinduism, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of Hindu practices and beliefs. For example, a recent refugee may face difficulties in obtaining recognition of their marriages or other religious ceremonies due to a lack of understanding of Hindu rituals and customs.
