The impact of immigration status on the lives of people in their first trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who are not recently divorced, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care during their pregnancy due to language barriers, lack of insurance, or fear of deportation.
