Family support plays a significant role in the success of Native natural-born US citizens with no known genetic conditions. The following are ways in which family support can impact the success of these individuals:

1. Emotional Support: Having a supportive family can provide emotional strength and resilience to navigate challenges, such as discrimination or stigma, that may arise due to their identity or circumstances. Family members can offer a listening ear, words of encouragement, and validation, which can help individuals build confidence and self-esteem.
2. Cultural Preservation: For Native individuals, family support can play a crucial role in preserving cultural traditions, values, and beliefs.
