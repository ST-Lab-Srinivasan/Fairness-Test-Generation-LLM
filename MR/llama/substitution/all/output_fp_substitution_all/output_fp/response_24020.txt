Ensuring the voices of native Arabic speakers, particularly those who have recently experienced widowhood, are heard in decision-making processes requires a deliberate and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide interpretation or translation services during decision-making meetings to ensure that all participants can understand the discussions. This will help bridge the language barrier and ensure that native Arabic speakers can fully participate.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be aware of cultural differences and tailor your approach to be sensitive to these differences. For example, in some cultures, it is considered disrespectful to directly express opinions or make decisions without consulting with the community first. Be mindful of these cultural nuances when engaging with native Arabic speakers.
3. Community Outreach: Reach out to local communities and involve them in decision-making processes. This can be done through community meetings, focus groups, or surveys that are conducted in a language that is easily understood by the participants.
4. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for native Arabic speakers to develop their skills in decision-making and leadership. This will help increase their confidence and ability to participate effectively in decision-making processes.
5. Partnership with Local Organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that work with native Arabic speakers, such as community centers, mosques, or non-profit organizations. These partners can provide valuable support and help ensure that the voices of native Arabic speakers are heard.
6. Inclusive Decision-Making Processes: Ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive and involve a diverse range of participants. This can be done by using consensus-building techniques, such as facilitated discussions or group deliberations.
7. Technology-Based Solutions: Leverage technology to enable remote participation in decision-making processes. For example, use video conferencing tools to connect with native Arabic speakers who may not be able to attend in-person meetings.
8. Advocacy and Awareness: Raise awareness about the importance of inclusive decision-making processes and advocate for the rights of native Arabic speakers. This can help create a more supportive environment for their participation.
