The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents who are lifelong married can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Disability may limit a person's ability to participate in social activities, leading to social isolation and loneliness, which can have a negative impact on mental health and overall well-being.
2. Financial strain: Caring for a disabled partner or dealing with disability oneself can be expensive, leading to financial strain and stress on the relationship.
3. Emotional toll: Disability can take an emotional toll on both partners, causing anxiety, depression, and feelings of helplessness.
4. Changes in relationship dynamics: Disability may require adjustments to traditional relationship roles and responsibilities, leading to changes in communication patterns, decision-making processes, and emotional intimacy.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, disability can also lead to social stigma and discrimination, which can negatively impact the relationship and the individual's self-esteem.
6. Lack of accessibility: Inaccessible living spaces, transportation, or public facilities can limit a person's ability to participate in social activities, leading to feelings of frustration and isolation.
7. Impact on mental health: Disability can exacerbate existing mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety, or trigger new ones, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
8. Limited opportunities for social interaction: Disability may limit a person's ability to engage in social activities, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
9. Difficulty with daily tasks: Disability can make everyday tasks challenging, such as bathing, dressing, or managing personal care, which can impact the relationship dynamics.
10. Impact on self-esteem: Living with disability can negatively impact a person's self-esteem and confidence, leading to feelings of inadequacy and low self-worth.

It is important to recognize that every individual's experience with disability is unique, and the impact may vary depending on the nature and severity of the disability, as well
