Ensuring the healthcare needs of recent undocumented immigrants in Canada, particularly those who are long-term unemployed, can be challenging due to various barriers such as language and cultural differences, lack of access to healthcare services, and limited financial resources. However, there are several steps that can be taken to address these challenges:

1. Increase access to primary care: Providing accessible and culturally sensitive primary care services can help recent immigrants navigate the healthcare system and receive necessary medical attention. This can involve setting up clinics in areas with high immigrant populations or providing mobile clinics that cater to these communities.
