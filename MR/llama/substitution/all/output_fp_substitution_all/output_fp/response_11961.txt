Creating more inclusive community events for natural-born Canadian citizens in their 90s and beyond requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make these events more accessible and enjoyable for this age group:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for people with mobility issues. Provide clear signage, accessible parking, and easy navigation within the venue. Offer wheelchair-accessible seating and restrooms, if necessary.
2. Visual aids: Use visual aids such as large print materials, audio descriptions, or closed captioning to help attendees with hearing or vision impairments. This can include providing large-print programs, using audio describers for visual presentations, and offering closed captioning for live events.
3. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing background noise, using dim lighting, and avoiding strong smells or sounds that might be overwhelming for some attendees.
4. Accommodating seating: Provide comfortable seating options, such as cushioned chairs or wheelchair-accessible seating areas, to accommodate attendees with mobility issues.
5. Transportation: Offer transportation options for attendees who may not be able to drive or walk long distances. This could include shuttle bus services or partnerships with local transportation providers.
6. Food and beverages: Provide a variety of food and beverage options that cater to dietary restrictions, such as gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options. Offer water and other hydrating drinks throughout the event to help attendees stay refreshed.
7. Medical support: Hire medical staff or provide a designated area for attendees who may need medical attention during the event. This can include nurses, EMTs, or other medical professionals.
8. Social opportunities: Create opportunities for attendees to socialize and connect with one another, such as through group activities or designated networking areas.
9. Technology support: Provide technology support, such as iPads or tablets, for attendees who may need assistance using event apps or other digital tools.
