Blue-collar Nigerians face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to justice: Many blue-collar workers in Nigeria struggle to access legal services due to financial constraints. They may not be able to afford legal fees or may not have the means to travel to a lawyer's office.
2. Lack of representation: Blue-collar workers often lack adequate representation in legal matters, such as labor disputes or land disputes. This can result in unequal treatment under the law and a lack of protection for their rights.
3. Limited awareness of legal rights: Many blue-collar workers are not aware of their legal rights and may be taken advantage of by unscrupulous individuals or organizations.
4. Discrimination: Blue-collar workers, particularly those in informal employment, may face discrimination in the workplace and in access to legal services.
5. Limited access to legal resources: Many blue-collar workers do not have access to legal resources such as law libraries or online legal databases, which can make it difficult for them to gather information or prepare their case.
6. Lack of trust in the legal system: Blue-collar workers may have a lack of trust in the legal system due to past experiences of being ignored or dismissed by the courts.
7. Limited access to legal aid: Many blue-collar workers do not have access to legal aid services, which can provide them with free or low-cost legal representation.
8. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The legal system may not be culturally sensitive to the needs and practices of blue-collar workers, particularly those from marginalized communities.
9. Limited access to technology: Many blue-collar workers do not have access to technology such as computers or smartphones, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system or access legal resources online.
10. Lack of social support: Blue-collar workers may not have a support network of friends, family, or community members who can provide emotional and practical support during legal proceedings.
