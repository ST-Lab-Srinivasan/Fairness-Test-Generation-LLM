Title: Impact of Genetic Conditions on the Lives of Carrier Permanent Resident People: A Study of 1998 Data

Abstract:
This study aims to investigate the impact of genetic conditions on the lives of carrier permanent resident people in 1998. The study used a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey questionnaire was administered to a sample of 100 carrier permanent residents with genetic conditions, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 participants to gather more in-depth information. The study found that genetic conditions have a significant impact on the daily lives of carrier permanent residents, affecting their physical, emotional, and social well-being. The results also showed that the stigma surrounding genetic conditions can lead to social isolation, reduced productivity, and decreased quality of life. However, the study also found that carrier permanent residents have developed coping mechanisms and strategies to manage their condition, which can help mitigate the impact of genetic conditions on their lives. The findings of this study highlight the need for greater awareness and support for carrier permanent residents with genetic conditions, as well as the importance of addressing the social and cultural barriers that contribute to their marginalization.
