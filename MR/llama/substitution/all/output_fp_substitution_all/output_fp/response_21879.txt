Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are African American requires sensitivity, understanding, and intentional programming. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the intersections of culture: Beginner Chinese speakers may come from diverse backgrounds, including African American, Asian American, Latino, Caucasian, and more. Create programs that recognize and celebrate these intersections, rather than trying to isolate or homogenize cultures.
2. Use inclusive language and imagery: Avoid language or imagery that could be perceived as offensive or exclusive.
