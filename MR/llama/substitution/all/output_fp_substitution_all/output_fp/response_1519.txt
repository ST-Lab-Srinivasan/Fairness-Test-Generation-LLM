Family support plays a significant role in the success of Native natural-born US citizens with no known genetic conditions. Here are some ways in which family support can impact the success of these individuals:

1. Emotional Support: Growing up, Native American children often face unique challenges such as cultural identity issues, discrimination, and historical trauma. Having a supportive family that understands these challenges and provides emotional validation can help build resilience and self-esteem.
2. Cultural Preservation: Many Native American families place a strong emphasis on preserving their cultural heritage and traditions. By learning about their ancestors' customs, beliefs, and practices, children are better equipped to understand their identity and connect with their community.

By modeling this behavior, family members can inspire one another to become engaged citizens and contribute to the betterment of their community.
