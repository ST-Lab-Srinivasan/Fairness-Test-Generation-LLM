2. Provide access to opportunities: Offer equal opportunities for training, education, and competition to all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
3. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent individuals from underrepresented groups from participating in sports, such as lack of access to resources, infrastructure, or opportunities.
4. Promote inclusive culture: Foster a culture of inclusion and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Encourage diversity and celebrate the unique perspectives and experiences of all athletes.
