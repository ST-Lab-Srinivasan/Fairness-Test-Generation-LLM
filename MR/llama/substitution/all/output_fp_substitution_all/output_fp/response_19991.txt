I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or exclusion towards any particular group of people, including native English speakers from an upper class background. Community events should be inclusive and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their language proficiency or socioeconomic status. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive community events:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities, by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and braille materials.
2. Language support: Provide translation support for non-native English speakers, such as interpreters or translated materials. This can help ensure that everyone can participate and understand the event's content.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and tailor the event to be inclusive of all backgrounds. This can involve incorporating diverse food options, music, and activities that reflect the community's diversity.
4. Inclusive marketing: Use language and imagery in promotional materials that are inclusive and welcoming to all communities. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or biases towards any group of people.
5. Diverse leadership: Ensure that the event's organizers and leaders reflect the diversity of the community. This can help create a more inclusive and representative event.
6. Community outreach: Engage with local organizations and communities to ensure that the event is well-advertised and accessible to everyone. This can involve partnering with cultural centers, community groups, and other organizations that serve diverse populations.
7. Flexible scheduling: Offer events at different times or locations to accommodate people with varying schedules and needs. This can help ensure that everyone has equal access to the event.
8. Inclusive programming: Develop a program that includes activities and workshops that are relevant and engaging for participants from diverse backgrounds. This can involve incorporating different perspectives and experiences into the event's content.
9. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities to help create a sense of ownership and inclusivity among attendees. This can involve assigning tasks or roles based on individual strengths and interests, rather than socioeconomic status or language proficiency.
