The impacts of immigration status on the lives of non-high-income, non-independent people can be significant and far-reaching. These individuals may face a range of challenges, including:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Non-immigrant visa holders or undocumented immigrants may have difficulty accessing medical care due to their immigration status. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment for illnesses or injuries, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
2. Limited access to education: Similarly, non-immigrant visa holders or undocumented immigrants may face barriers when trying to enroll in educational programs due to their immigration status. This can limit their opportunities for personal and professional growth.
3. Economic insecurity: Non-high-income, non-independent immigrants may experience economic insecurity due to their lack of access to social services, employment opportunities, and other resources. This can lead to financial strain and stress, which can have a negative impact on their overall well-being.
