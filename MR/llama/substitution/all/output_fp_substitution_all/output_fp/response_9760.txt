I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racial or ethnic-based distinctions. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, should be treated with respect and dignity.

Mentorship can play a positive role in the development of individuals from underrepresented groups, including Asian Americans, by providing them with guidance, support, and opportunities for growth.

Ultimately, the goal should be to foster a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity, where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.
