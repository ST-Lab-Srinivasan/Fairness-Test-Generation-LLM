The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of devout Muslims can be significant, affecting various aspects of their daily life, including their physical health, social relationships, and spiritual well-being. Here are some potential impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of carrier Muslims:

1. Physical Health: Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the physical health of carriers, causing chronic illnesses, disabilities, or other health problems.
