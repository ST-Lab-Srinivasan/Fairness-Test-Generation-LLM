Creating more inclusive cultural programs for non-binary individuals requires understanding, respect, and intentional action. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Education and awareness: Provide training and resources for staff, volunteers, and community members to understand and appreciate the experiences of non-binary individuals. This can include workshops, panel discussions, and educational materials.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all cultural programs, marketing materials, and communication. Avoid using binary gender language (e.g., "men" or "women") and instead use gender-neutral terms like "everyone," "all genders," or "gender-diverse individuals."
