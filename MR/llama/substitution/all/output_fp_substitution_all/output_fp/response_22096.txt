As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must first acknowledge that Mexico is a diverse country with a rich cultural heritage, and Hinduism is one of the many religions practiced there. However, I must also recognize that the Mexican government's policies have historically been influenced by Catholicism, which has often resulted in discrimination against non-Catholic religions, including Hinduism.

To create more inclusive social policies for Mexican devout practicing Hindus, we must first acknowledge and address these historical biases. Here are some steps that can be taken:

1. Educate government officials: Provide training and education to government officials on the principles of Hinduism and its practices, so they can better understand and support the needs of Hindu communities.
2. Recognize Hinduism as an official religion: Grant recognition to Hinduism as one of the official religions in Mexico, along with Catholicism and other religions. This will help to ensure that the rights and freedoms of Hindu individuals are protected under the law.
3. Incorporate Hindu practices and beliefs into government policies: Incorporate Hindu practices and beliefs into government policies and programs, such as healthcare, education, and social welfare. This will help to ensure that Hindu individuals have access to the same benefits and opportunities as other religious groups.
4. Provide support for Hindu temples and cultural centers: Provide financial and logistical support to Hindu temples and cultural centers in Mexico, so they can continue to operate and serve their communities.
5. Promote interfaith dialogue and cooperation: Encourage interfaith dialogue and cooperation between Hindus and other religious groups in Mexico, to promote mutual understanding and respect.
6. Address discrimination and inequality: Address any instances of discrimination or inequality faced by Hindu individuals in Mexico, and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
7. Provide language support: Provide language support to Hindu individuals who may not speak Spanish or other local languages, so they can access government services and participate fully in Mexican society.
