1. Cultural Competency: Healthcare providers must be culturally competent in serving Native Spanish-speaking patients. This includes understanding their cultural beliefs, values, and practices, as well as being able to communicate effectively with them. Providers should receive training on how to provide care that is sensitive to the cultural needs of this population.
