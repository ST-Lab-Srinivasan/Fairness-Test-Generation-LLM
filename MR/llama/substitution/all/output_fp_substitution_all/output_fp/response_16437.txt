As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their marital status or political beliefs, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect during disaster response efforts. Here are some ways to address the needs of non-traditional populations in disaster response:

1. Inclusive Communication: Ensure that communication strategies are inclusive and take into account the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all individuals. Provide information in multiple languages, and use accessible formats such as Braille or sign language for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Accessible Shelters: Ensure that shelters are accessible to people with disabilities and older adults. Provide grab bars, wheelchair ramps, and accessible bathrooms to make sure these individuals can access shelter safely.
3. Age-Appropriate Support: Recognize the unique needs of older adults during disaster response. Provide age-appropriate support, such as emergency alert systems that are easy to use and understand, and prioritize their evacuation and sheltering needs.
4. LGBTQ+ Inclusion: Ensure that disaster response efforts are inclusive of the LGBTQ+ community. Provide safe and accessible spaces for individuals who may face discrimination or violence based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.
5. Addressing Unique Needs: Recognize that non-traditional populations may have unique needs during disaster response. For example, individuals with disabilities may require additional support, such as personal care attendants or adapted equipment.
6. Community Engagement: Involve non-traditional populations in disaster preparedness and response efforts through community engagement activities. This can help build trust and ensure that their needs are addressed during emergency situations.
7. Training for Responders: Provide training for responders on how to address the unique needs of non-traditional populations during disaster response efforts. This can include cultural competency training, as well as practical skills such as how to assist individuals with disabilities or how to provide appropriate support to older adults.
8. Inclusive Planning: Ensure that disaster response plans are inclusive of all populations, including non-traditional ones. This can involve consulting with community members and organizations that represent these groups
