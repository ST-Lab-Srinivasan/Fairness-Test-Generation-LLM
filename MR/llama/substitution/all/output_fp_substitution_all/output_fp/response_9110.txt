To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish speakers and native French speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Reach out to individuals who are beginners in Spanish and native French speakers to gather their experiences and opinions through surveys or interviews. You can ask questions related to their language learning journey, such as the challenges they faced, the resources they used, and their overall satisfaction with their progress.
2. Analyze language learning data: Utilize online language learning platforms' data to understand the learning patterns and preferences of beginner Spanish speakers and native French speakers. You can analyze metrics such as time spent on tasks, accuracy rates, and user engagement to identify trends and patterns.
3. Use sentiment analysis: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze online reviews, comments, and social media posts from learners of Spanish and French languages. This can help you understand the emotions and opinions expressed by learners, such as frustrations or satisfactions, which can provide valuable insights into their experiences.
4. Create a language learning community: Develop an online community for learners of Spanish and French languages, where they can share their experiences, ask questions, and support each other. By analyzing the interactions within this community, you can gain insights into the challenges faced by beginner learners and identify potential solutions.
5. Use machine learning algorithms: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of language learning data, including learner demographics, learning patterns, and progress metrics. These algorithms can help identify predictors of success and failure in language learning, which can guide the development of personalized learning recommendations.
6. Conduct linguistic analysis: Use computational linguistics techniques to analyze the language use and grammar of beginner Spanish speakers and native French speakers. This can help you understand their language proficiency levels, areas of improvement, and preferences for language learning resources.
7. Collaborate with language learning experts: Work with language learning experts to develop insights into the challenges faced by beginner learners. These experts can provide valuable feedback on the design and implementation of language learning resources, as well as recommendations for improving learner engagement and retention.
8. Use game-based learning: Develop games or interactive activities that simulate real-life
