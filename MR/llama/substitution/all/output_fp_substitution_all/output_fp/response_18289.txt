Ensuring the legal rights of long-term single individuals who serve in the military for an extended period are protected can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to address this issue. Here are some potential solutions:

1. Review and update military policies: The first step is to review and update military policies to ensure they are fair and equitable. This may involve revising the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and other regulations to provide greater protections for long-term single service members.
