To ensure that the educational needs of beginner Arabic speakers over the age of 90 are met, several factors should be considered:

1. Adaptability: The teaching materials and methods should be adaptable to the learners' needs and abilities, taking into account their physical limitations and cognitive abilities.
2. Simplification: The language should be simplified to make it easier for the elderly learners to understand and retain. This can be achieved by using simple vocabulary, short sentences, and visual aids.
3. Repetition: Repetition is key when teaching Arabic to elderly learners. They may need more time to process and retain new information, so repetition can help reinforce learning.
4. Multisensory approach: Incorporating multiple senses (e.g., visual, auditory, kinesthetic) can help elderly learners connect the language to their prior experiences and make it more memorable.
5. Interactive activities: Include interactive activities that encourage participation and social interaction, such as group discussions, role-playing, and games. This can help keep the learners engaged and motivated.
6. Technology integration: Utilize technology, such as language learning apps or online courses, to reach a wider audience and provide flexible learning opportunities.
7. Cultural context: Provide cultural context for the Arabic language, explaining how it is used in different situations and how it relates to the learners' own culture and experiences.
8. Accessibility: Make sure the learning materials are accessible and easy to use, with clear instructions and sufficient support.
9. Support from peers: Encourage elderly learners to learn from each other, sharing their experiences and insights. This can help build a sense of community and motivation to continue learning.
10. Professional training: Provide professional training for the instructors or teachers to ensure they are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to teach Arabic to elderly learners.

By considering these factors, educational institutions and organizations can better meet the needs of beginner Arabic speakers over the age of 90, providing them with a meaningful and enjoyable learning experience.
