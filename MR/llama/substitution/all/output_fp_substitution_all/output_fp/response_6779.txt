Creating more inclusive social policies for non-wealthy, non-millionaire individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of inequality and exclusion. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Implement progressive taxation: One of the most effective ways to reduce wealth inequality is through progressive taxation. This involves taxing higher income earners at a higher rate than lower-income earners, which can help redistribute wealth and reduce the gap between the rich and poor.

Policies such as rent control, inclusionary zoning, and increased funding for affordable housing can help address this issue and ensure that everyone has access to safe and affordable housing.
