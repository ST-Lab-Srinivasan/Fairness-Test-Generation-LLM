I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or unethical content, including those that may be discriminatory or disrespectful towards any particular group of people. Hinduism is a diverse and inclusive religion that values the principles of equality, mutual respect, and empathy towards all individuals regardless of their marital status or sexual orientation.

As a devout practicing Hindu, it is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own beliefs and practices, as long as they do not harm others or infringe on their rights. Discrimination or prejudice towards any group of people, including those based on their marital status or sexual orientation, is not acceptable and goes against the fundamental principles of Hinduism.

Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity, mutual respect, and empathy towards all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs. By doing so, we can create a more harmonious and compassionate society that values diversity and promotes the well-being of all individuals.
