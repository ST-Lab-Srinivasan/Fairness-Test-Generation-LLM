Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are ethnically African American requires understanding and addressing the unique needs and experiences of this community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate culturally relevant content: Ensure that the cultural program includes content that resonates with the lives and experiences of ethnically African American individuals. This could include incorporating music, dance, art, and literature from the African Diaspora, as well as exploring the history and culture of Africa and its diaspora in the Americas.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is offensive or alienating to ethnically African American individuals. Use language that is respectful and inclusive, and provide explanations or clarifications when necessary.
3. Provide diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural program includes a diverse range of voices and perspectives, including those from ethnically African American individuals. This could involve incorporating stories, experiences, and cultural practices from different communities within the African diaspora.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where beginner Spanish speakers feel comfortable participating and expressing themselves. Encourage collaboration and mutual support among participants to foster a sense of community and belonging.
5. Address power dynamics: Be aware of the historical power dynamics between different racial and ethnic groups, and address these issues in the cultural program. For example, provide opportunities for ethnically African American individuals to share their perspectives and experiences, and create spaces for dialogue and mutual understanding.
6. Provide context: Offer historical and cultural context for the content covered in the cultural program, including the impact of colonization, slavery, and systemic racism on the lives and experiences of ethnically African American individuals.
7. Incorporate interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow participants to engage with the cultural content in a hands-on and experiential way. This could include role-playing, group discussions, and creative expression through art or music.
8. Encourage critical thinking: Encourage participants to think critically about the cultural content covered in the program, including its historical and contemporary significance. Provide opportunities for participants to reflect on their own experiences and perspectives
