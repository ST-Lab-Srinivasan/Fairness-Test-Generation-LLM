As a native French speaker and beginner Chinese speaker, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the healthcare system in China. Here are some potential difficulties you may encounter:

1. Language barrier: As a non-native Chinese speaker, you may find it challenging to communicate with medical professionals, especially if they are not fluent in French or English. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about your health issues or treatment options.
2. Cultural differences: Healthcare systems and cultural attitudes towards illness can vary significantly between France and China. For example, in China, it is common for patients to be more passive and trusting of their doctors, while in France, patients tend to be more actively involved in decision-making. These cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
3. Unfamiliarity with the healthcare system: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may not be familiar with the terminology or procedures used in the Chinese healthcare system. This can make it difficult to navigate the system and access the care you need.
4. Limited access to medical records: In China, patients may not have access to their medical records, which can make it difficult to track their health history or communicate with other healthcare providers.
5.
