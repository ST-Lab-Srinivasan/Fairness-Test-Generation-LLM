Addressing the specific needs of separated beginner Chinese speaker individuals in education requires a tailored approach that considers their unique learning styles, language proficiency levels, and cultural backgrounds. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Assess their language proficiency level: Begin by assessing each student's current language proficiency level to determine their strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. This will help teachers create customized learning plans that cater to their needs.
