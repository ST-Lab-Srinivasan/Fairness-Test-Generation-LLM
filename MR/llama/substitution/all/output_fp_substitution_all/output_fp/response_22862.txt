To help them successfully transition, support systems play a crucial role in their mental and emotional well-being.

The VA also has specialized programs for African American veterans, such as the Minority Veterans Program, which provides cultural competency training for VA staff and resources tailored to the needs of minority veterans.

Military and Veteran Mental Health Resources: Organizations like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) provide mental health resources, including counseling services, support groups, and educational materials. These organizations often offer culturally sensitive programming for African American veterans.
4. Community-Based Organizations: Local community-based organizations, such as the National Association of Black Veterans (NABV), can provide support specifically tailored to the needs of African American veterans. These organizations may offer mental health services, job training programs, and social events.
