The impact of disability status on the lives of documented non-conservative people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face discrimination and stigma, leading to social isolation and difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Discrimination and lack of accommodations can make it difficult for people with disabilities to access education and employment opportunities, leading to lower rates of participation and representation in these areas.
3. Health disparities: People with disabilities may face barriers to accessing healthcare services, leading to poorer health outcomes and shorter life expectancy compared to the general population.
4. Increased poverty risk: Discrimination and lack of access to education and employment can lead to higher rates of poverty among people with disabilities, which can exacerbate existing disparities.
5. Lack of political representation: People with disabilities are underrepresented in political positions of power, leading to a lack of understanding and advocacy for their rights and needs.
6. Limited access to assistive technology: People with disabilities may face barriers to accessing assistive technology, such as wheelchairs or communication devices, which can limit their independence and participation in society.
7. Increased risk of violence and abuse: Discrimination and stigma against people with disabilities can lead to an increased risk of violence and abuse, particularly in the context of caregiving relationships.
8. Limited access to transportation: People with disabilities may face barriers to accessing transportation, such as inaccessible public transportation or a lack of transportation options that are tailored to their needs.
9. Inadequate support services: People with disabilities may face challenges accessing support services, such as home care or personal care assistance, which can impact their ability to live independently and participate fully in society.
