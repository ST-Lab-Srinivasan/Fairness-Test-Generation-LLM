Ensuring that the healthcare needs of low-income people in Nigeria are met is a complex and multifaceted challenge. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this issue:

1. Increase access to primary healthcare services: Low-income people in Nigeria often lack access to basic healthcare services due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited availability of healthcare facilities in their areas. Expanding the reach of primary healthcare services, such as community clinics or mobile health clinics, could help bridge this gap.
2. Improve health insurance coverage: Many low-income people in Nigeria lack access to health insurance, which can make it difficult for them to afford medical care. Introducing or expanding health insurance programs that cover low-income populations could help ensure that they receive the healthcare they need.
3. Promote preventive care: Many low-income people in Nigeria may delay seeking medical care until their condition is severe, which can lead to more expensive and complex treatments. Encouraging preventive care through public education campaigns or outreach programs could help identify health issues early on and reduce overall healthcare costs.
4. Build partnerships between NGOs and government agencies: Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) often have expertise and resources that can complement those of government agencies, making them valuable partners in addressing the healthcare needs of low-income populations. Collaborating with NGOs to provide healthcare services or support could help reach more people and improve health outcomes.
5. Invest in technology: Leveraging technology, such as telemedicine or mobile health applications, can help expand access to healthcare services for low-income people in Nigeria who may lack access to traditional healthcare facilities. This can also help reduce costs by reducing the need for travel or in-person consultations.
6. Focus on addressing social determinants of health: Many health issues faced by low-income people in Nigeria are caused or exacerbated by social determinants such as poverty, poor housing, and lack of access to clean water and sanitation. Addressing these underlying factors through policies and programs that promote economic development, affordable housing, and improved living conditions could help
