The impact of immigration status on the lives of native Arabic speakers can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to basic rights and services: Immigration status can affect a person's access to basic rights and services such as healthcare, education, and employment. For example, undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing healthcare services or enrolling their children in school.
