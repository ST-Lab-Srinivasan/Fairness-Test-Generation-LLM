To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner French and Arabic speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Conduct a survey: Create an online survey or questionnaire that targets individuals who are learning French or Arabic as beginners. The survey should include questions about their language learning experience, such as the difficulty they face in understanding grammar rules, vocabulary, and pronunciation. You could also ask questions about their motivation for learning the language, any challenges they encounter, and their overall satisfaction with the learning process.
2. Analyze language learning data: Collect data on the number of words, phrases, or sentences that beginners learn in French or Arabic compared to more advanced learners. You could also analyze data on the time it takes for beginners to reach different levels of proficiency in each language.
3. Use language learning apps: Analyze data from language learning apps such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to understand how users progress and encounter challenges while learning French or Arabic. You could look at the number of users who drop off after a certain period, the most common mistakes made by beginners, or the areas where learners struggle the most.
4. Conduct case studies: Choose a small group of beginner language learners and conduct in-depth interviews or observations to understand their experiences and challenges in learning French or Arabic. You could analyze their language learning strategies, identify any common challenges they face, and provide recommendations for improving their learning experience.
5. Compare data from different sources: Analyze data from various sources, such as language learning apps, surveys, and educational research studies, to identify patterns and trends in the challenges faced by beginner French and Arabic speakers. This could help you gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issues and provide insights on how to address them.
6. Create interactive visualizations: Use data visualization tools to create interactive charts, graphs, or maps that illustrate the challenges faced by beginner language learners. This could make the data more engaging and easier to understand for a wider audience.
7. Use machine learning algorithms: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of language learning data and identify patterns that can help predict the challenges faced by beginner learners. You could use this information to develop personal
