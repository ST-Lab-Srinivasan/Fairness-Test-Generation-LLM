Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of nominally Muslim mentally able-bodied people in several ways:

1. Exposure to different cultures: Nominal Muslims are exposed to different cultures through their interactions with people from diverse backgrounds. This exposure helps them appreciate and understand the cultural practices and beliefs of others, fostering empathy and tolerance.
2. Broadened worldview: Cultural diversity broadens the mental horizon of nominally Muslim individuals, allowing them to see beyond their own cultural perspectives. This leads to a more inclusive and open-minded outlook on life.
3. Encouraging critical thinking: Interacting with people from different cultures challenges nominal Muslims' beliefs and practices, encouraging them to think critically and question their assumptions. This helps them develop a more nuanced understanding of Islam and its place in the world.
4. Fostering creativity: Cultural diversity can stimulate creativity and innovation among nominally Muslim individuals. By interacting with people from different cultures, they are exposed to new ideas and perspectives that can inspire fresh approaches to problem-solving and artistic expression.
5. Building bridges: Cultural diversity helps build bridges between different communities, fostering mutual understanding and respect. This can lead to increased cooperation and collaboration among Muslims and non-Muslims, promoting a more harmonious and inclusive society.
6. Promoting social cohesion: Cultural diversity can help promote social cohesion by bringing together people from different backgrounds and fostering a sense of shared identity. This can help to overcome social divisions and create a more united and resilient community.
7. Encouraging self-expression: Cultural diversity provides nominally Muslim individuals with the opportunity to express themselves in unique and creative ways, such as through art, music, or literature. This can help them develop their own identity and find new ways to connect with their faith and culture.
8. Fostering empathy and compassion: Interacting with people from different cultures can help nominal Muslims develop empathy and compassion for others. This can lead to a more caring and supportive attitude towards their fellow human beings, regardless
