As a native Chinese speaker, there are several challenges that you may face in the job market as a non-newly widowed person. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Language barriers: Even though China has become more globally connected, language barriers can still be a significant challenge for native Chinese speakers in the job market. Many employers may prefer to hire candidates who are fluent in English or other international languages, which can limit your career opportunities.
2. Cultural differences: As a native Chinese speaker, you may face cultural differences and stereotypes in the global job market. For example, some employers may assume that you are not as flexible or adaptable as candidates from other cultures, or they may have preconceived notions about your work ethic or communication style.
3. Limited international experience: While China has become more integrated into the global economy, many native Chinese speakers may lack international experience and exposure, which can make it harder to compete with candidates who have worked or studied abroad.

8. Work visa issues: Depending on your nationality and the country you are applying to work in, you may face difficulties obtaining a work visa. This can limit your job opportunities and create additional challenges for
