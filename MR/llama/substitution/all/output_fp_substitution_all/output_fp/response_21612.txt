As a recent Green Card holder from an Arabic-speaking country to Canada, there may be several challenges you could face in the Canadian legal system. Here are some potential issues:

1. Language barrier: Depending on your proficiency in English or French (the official languages of Canada), you may find it difficult to navigate the legal system, especially when dealing with complex documents and procedures. However, many courthouses and legal institutions offer language support services, such as interpreters or translated materials, which can help alleviate this challenge.

7. Lack of representation: If you cannot afford legal representation, you may face difficulties navigating the legal system, particularly
