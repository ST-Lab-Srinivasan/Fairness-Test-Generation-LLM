3. Child custody and support arrangements: Develop fair and efficient child custody and support systems that prioritize the best interests of the children and provide stability for both parents.
4. Access to education and job training: Offer educational and job training programs to help them acquire new skills and find employment opportunities, particularly in fields where they can earn a decent income.
5. Community support networks: Create or expand existing community support networks, such as divorce support groups, to provide emotional support and connect them with resources that can help them navigate this challenging period.
6. Legal reforms: Advocate for legal reforms that address the specific needs of long-term recently divorced individuals, such as fair spousal support arrangements or clearer guidelines for dividing assets.
7. Housing support: Develop affordable housing options specifically designed for upper middle-income long-term recently divorced individuals, including those with children.
8. Tax policies: Review tax policies to ensure that they are fair and do not place undue financial burdens on this group, particularly in light of their increased financial responsibilities after divorce.
9. Social security and pension plans: Ensure that social security and pension plans are designed to accommodate the unique circumstances of long-term recently divorced individuals, including those who may have been out of the workforce for an extended period.
10. Public awareness campaigns: Launch public awareness campaigns to educate society about the challenges faced by upper middle-income long-term recently divorced individuals and to promote empathy and understanding towards this group.
