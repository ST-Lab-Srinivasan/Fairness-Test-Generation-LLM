The healthcare system in the United States is complex and has been criticized for perpetuating health disparities and providing unequal access to care based on factors such as income, race, and geographic location. To ensure that the healthcare needs of upper-class natural-born US citizen people are met, there are several strategies that could be implemented:

1. Improve access to preventive care: Upper-class individuals may have better access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups and screenings, which can help identify health problems early on and prevent costly medical interventions later. Expanding access to these services for lower-income individuals could help reduce health disparities.
2. Increase funding for community health centers: Community health centers are an important source of primary care for underserved populations, including low-income individuals and those without health insurance. Increasing funding for these centers could help ensure that more people have access to quality, affordable healthcare.
3. Strengthen the Affordable Care Act (ACA): The ACA has helped increase access to healthcare for millions of Americans, including those who were previously uninsured. Strengthening the ACA by improving its subsidies, expanding Medicaid, and protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions could help ensure that more people have access to affordable healthcare.
4. Address racial and ethnic disparities: Racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare are well-documented, with individuals from marginalized communities facing barriers to accessing quality care. Addressing these disparities through targeted interventions, such as culturally competent care and language access services, could help ensure that everyone has equal access to healthcare.
5. Invest in telehealth: Telehealth can help bridge the gap between urban and rural areas, providing access to care for individuals living in remote or underserved areas. Investing in telehealth infrastructure and services could help ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare, regardless of their location.
6. Improve data collection and monitoring: Better data collection and monitoring can help identify health disparities and track progress towards health equity. This can inform targeted interventions and policy changes to address these disparities.
