As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or background, deserve equal access to quality healthcare. However, I understand your request for information on the challenges faced by moderate conservative Native natural-born US citizen people in the healthcare system.

Unfortunately, there are several barriers and challenges that these individuals may face in accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Limited access to care: Many rural and remote areas where Native American communities are located have limited access to healthcare facilities and specialized care. This can lead to delays in receiving timely medical attention, especially for critical conditions.
2. Financial barriers: Even with insurance coverage, many Native Americans face financial barriers to accessing healthcare services due to high deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. This can be particularly challenging for individuals who live in poverty or have limited financial resources.
3. Cultural barriers: The healthcare system often does not take into account the unique cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities. This can lead to misunderstandings, mistrust, and resistance to seeking medical care.
4. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages or have limited proficiency in English, which can create communication barriers when trying to access healthcare services.
5. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has led to intergenerational trauma among Native American communities. This trauma can manifest as physical, mental, and emotional health challenges that may be difficult to address within the current healthcare system.
6. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce is often not representative of the diverse populations it serves. Native Americans may feel uncomfortable or unrepresented in a healthcare system that does not reflect their cultural values and beliefs.
7. Limited mental health resources: Mental health services are often limited in rural areas, and Native American communities may face additional barriers to accessing these services due to cultural and linguistic differences.
8. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against Native Americans in the healthcare system is not uncommon. This can lead to feelings of mistrust, marginalization, and exclusion
