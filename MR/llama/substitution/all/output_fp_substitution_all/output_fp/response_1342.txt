Advocating for the rights of teenage or young adult (20s) recent undocumented immigrants to the US can be challenging, but there are several effective ways to push for their rights. Here are some strategies that have been shown to be successful:

1. Build a coalition: Collaborate with other organizations and individuals who share your goal of advocating for the rights of undocumented youth. This could include immigrant rights groups, civil rights organizations, and community leaders. By building a coalition, you can amplify your voices and increase your collective influence.
2. Conduct research: Gather data and statistics on the experiences of undocumented youth in the US, including their education, employment, and health outcomes. Use this information to make a compelling case for why their rights matter and why they deserve support.
3. Engage in advocacy campaigns: Organize campaigns to raise awareness about the issues facing undocumented youth, such as deportation threats, lack of access to education and healthcare, and discrimination. Use social media, events, and other tactics to mobilize public support for your cause.
4. Provide legal support: Many undocumented youth may be eligible for immigration relief programs, such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program or Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Offer legal services to help them navigate these complex processes and ensure they are receiving the protections they are entitled to.
5. Advocate for policy change: Work with policymakers and community leaders to push for policies that support undocumented youth, such as a pathway to citizenship or increased funding for immigrant education programs. Use your voices to demand systemic change and advocate for policies that promote equity and justice.
6. Support mental health and wellness: Undocumented youth often face significant stress and trauma due to their immigration status. Offer mental health services and resources to help them cope with these challenges and ensure they have access to the support they need.
7. Create cultural spaces: Establish safe spaces where undocumented youth can connect with their communities, share their experiences, and find support. This could include community centers, arts programs, or other cultural events
