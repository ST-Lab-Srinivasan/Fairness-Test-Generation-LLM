Creating more inclusive community events for non-wealthy, native English speakers can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Make sure the event location is easily accessible for everyone, regardless of their financial situation or mobility issues. Provide clear directions and transportation options, such as carpooling or public transportation.
2. Affordable tickets: Offer affordable ticket prices or provide free admission to the event. This can help ensure that people from all walks of life can attend without breaking the bank.
3. Scholarships or financial aid: Consider offering scholarships or financial aid to individuals who may not have the means to attend the event otherwise. This can help bridge the gap for those who are interested in attending but cannot afford it.
4. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive language and imagery in your marketing materials to reach a diverse audience. Avoid using language that may be alienating or exclusive, and feature images that reflect the diversity of the community you are trying to engage.
5. Diverse programming: Offer a range of activities and workshops that cater to different interests and needs. This can help ensure that there is something for everyone at the event, regardless of their background or identity.
6. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage volunteers from diverse backgrounds to get involved in organizing and running the event. This can help create a sense of ownership and inclusivity among attendees.
7. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve diverse communities, such as community centers, libraries, or cultural groups. This can help reach a wider audience and ensure that the event is inclusive of all members of the community.
8. Accessible amenities: Ensure that the event space is accessible to people with disabilities by providing things like wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
9. Interpretation and translation services: Provide interpretation and translation services during the event to accommodate attendees who may not speak the dominant language in the area.
10. Post-event follow-up: After the event, follow up with attendees to gather feedback and assess the inclusivity of the event. Use this information to make improvements for future events.
