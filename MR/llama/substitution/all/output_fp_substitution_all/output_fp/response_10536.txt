Congratulations on your recent marriage! Here are some ways to support the educational aspirations of late pregnancy (third trimester) newlyweds:

1. Financial Support: Offer to help with financial responsibilities during this time, such as paying bills, grocery shopping, and covering living expenses. This can help reduce stress and allow the couple to focus on their educational goals.
2. Childcare Assistance: Provide support in finding quality childcare options for the soon-to-be born baby, whether it's through a nanny, babysitter, or family member. This can help the couple attend classes, workshops, and other educational activities without worrying about their child's care.
3. Study Together: Offer to study together with the couple during their third trimester. You could join them in their prenatal yoga or birthing class, or even take an online course together. This can help build a sense of camaraderie and support during this important time.
4. Meal Preparation: Offer to prepare meals for the couple, especially if they are experiencing morning sickness or other pregnancy-related symptoms that may make cooking difficult. You could also prepare freezer meals or meal prep packages that they can easily reheat when needed.
5. Emotional Support: Pregnancy and marriage can be challenging, so it's essential to offer emotional support during this time. Listen to their concerns, provide words of encouragement, and remind them that they are not alone in this journey.
6. Household Chores: Help the couple with household chores such as cleaning, laundry, and errands. This can help reduce their workload and allow them to focus on their educational aspirations.
7. Resource Connection: Connect the couple with resources that can help them achieve their educational goals. For example, you could introduce them to local libraries, bookstores, or online educational platforms that offer free or low-cost courses and materials.
8. Practical Gifts: Give practical gifts that can help the couple during their pregnancy and new parenthood journey. Examples include a baby carrier, breastfeeding pillow, or a set of diapers and wipes.
