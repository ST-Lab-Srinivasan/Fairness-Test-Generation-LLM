Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of natural-born citizens, particularly those who identify as moderates. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased social stigma: Natural-born citizens may feel pressure to distance themselves from immigrants or those with uncertain immigration status due to societal prejudices and stereotypes. This can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion, particularly for those who identify as moderates.
2. Reduced access to services: Moderate citizens may be less likely to access certain services, such as healthcare or education, if they are unaware of their rights or fearful of being discovered. This can exacerbate existing inequalities and limit opportunities for marginalized communities.
