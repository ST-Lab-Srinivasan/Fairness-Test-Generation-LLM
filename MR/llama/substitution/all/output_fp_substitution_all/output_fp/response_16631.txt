Introduction:
Marriage is an important social institution that has significant implications for the lives of individuals around the world. In Mexico, marriage is a common occurrence, and it can have various impacts on the lives of individuals during late pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of late pregnancy (third trimester) Mexican individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their physical and mental health, social support networks, and economic stability. For example, married individuals tend to have better physical and mental health outcomes than unmarried individuals, as they have access to a supportive partner and social network (Townsend et al., 2014). Similarly, married individuals tend to have higher levels of social support and emotional well-being than unmarried individuals (DiMaggio & Wrobel, 2011).

In the context of pregnancy, marital status can also have significant impacts on an individual's experience. For example, married women tend to have better prenatal care and outcomes than unmarried women (Davis et al., 2013). Additionally, married individuals may have more access to resources such as financial support and emotional support during pregnancy and after childbirth (Kostanski & Mullen, 2014).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, specifically focus group discussions, to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of late pregnancy (third trimester) Mexican individuals. The participants will be recruited from obstetric clinics and hospitals in Mexico City, and will be purposively selected based on their marital status (married or unmarried). The discussions will be audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis to identify key themes and patterns.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the literature on the impacts of marital status on pregnancy outcomes and experiences. By exploring the experiences of late pregnancy (third trimester) Mexican individuals based on their marital status, this study can provide valuable insights into the ways
