The impact of marital status on the lives of non-beginner French speakers during the first three months of pregnancy can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional and Social Support: Marriage can provide emotional and social support during pregnancy, as partners can offer comfort, encouragement, and help with daily tasks. Non-beginner French speakers who are not married may lack this support system, which can impact their mental health and overall well-being.

Non-beginner French speakers who are not married may struggle with financial stress, especially during pregnancy when there are additional expenses related to prenatal care and baby supplies.
3. Decision-Making: Marriage can simplify decision-making during pregnancy, as both partners have a say in important decisions regarding the pregnancy and the baby. Non-beginner French speakers who are not married may find it more challenging to make decisions on their own or with a limited support system.

Non-beginner French speakers who are not married may face barriers in accessing quality prenatal care, which can impact the health and well-being of both the mother and the baby.
5. Social Stigma: Unfortunately, there may still be social stigmas attached to being unmarried during pregnancy, particularly in some cultures or communities. Non-beginner French speakers who are not married may face discrimination or judgment from family, friends, or strangers, which can be emotionally challenging.
