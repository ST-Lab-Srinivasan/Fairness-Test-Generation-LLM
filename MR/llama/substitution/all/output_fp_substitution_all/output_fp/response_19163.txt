Addressing the specific needs of native Chinese speakers who are recent refugees to the US in healthcare requires a comprehensive approach that considers their cultural, linguistic, and social factors. Here are some strategies that healthcare providers can adopt:

1. Provide interpreters and translators: Hire professional interpreters and translators who are fluent in Chinese to assist in communicating with patients who do not speak English fluently. This is particularly important for medical procedures, diagnoses, and treatment plans.
2. Use visual aids: Utilize pictures, diagrams, and videos to explain medical concepts and procedures to patients who may have limited English proficiency.
3. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide training to healthcare staff on cultural competence and the specific needs of refugees from diverse backgrounds. This can help staff understand the unique challenges faced by recent refugees and how to provide appropriate care.
4. Use plain language: Communicate medical information in a clear and simple manner, avoiding technical jargon or complex terminology that may be difficult for non-native English speakers to understand.
5. Foster a welcoming environment: Create a warm and inclusive atmosphere in healthcare settings to help refugees feel comfortable and confident in seeking medical care. This can involve providing information in multiple languages, using visual aids, and being sensitive to cultural norms and practices.
6. Build trust: Establish trust with patients through consistent and compassionate care. This can involve spending time with them, listening to their concerns, and providing emotional support during medical procedures or diagnoses.
7. Address language barriers in clinical settings: Ensure that clinical staff are aware of the patient's language needs and make appropriate accommodations, such as providing written materials in the patient's native language or using visual aids to facilitate communication.
8. Offer language classes: Consider offering language classes or resources for patients who want to improve their English skills. This can help them better understand medical information and communicate with healthcare providers.
9. Use technology: Utilize telemedicine or other technological tools to provide remote consultations or communication with patients who may have limited access to in-person care due to language barriers or other factors.
10. Collaborate with refugee organizations: Partner with local
