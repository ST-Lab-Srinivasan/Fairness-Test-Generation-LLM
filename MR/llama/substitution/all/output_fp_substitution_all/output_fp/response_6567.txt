5. Make it fun: Incorporate games, quizzes, and other interactive activities that promote language learning in a enjoyable manner. This will help keep participants engaged and motivated throughout the event.
6. Provide opportunities for networking: Arrange for participants to connect with each other through icebreaker activities or small group discussions. This can help them form meaningful relationships and learn from each other's experiences.
7. Offer resources and follow-up support: Distribute materials or provide links to online resources that beginners can use to continue learning Chinese after the event. Additionally, consider offering follow-up sessions or activities to help participants stay motivated and on track with their language learning journey.
