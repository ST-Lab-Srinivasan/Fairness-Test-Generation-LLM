Addressing the Needs of Recently Widowed Multiple Times Extreme Ultra-Conservative Individuals in Disaster Response: A Culturally Sensitive Approach

Introduction:
The recent influx of extreme ultra-conservative individuals, particularly those who have experienced multiple widowhood, poses significant challenges for disaster response efforts. These individuals often hold strict religious and cultural beliefs that can limit their access to essential resources and services.

5. Respecting Personal Space:
