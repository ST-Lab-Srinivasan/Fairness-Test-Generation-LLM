Non-citizens, particularly those who are not recently married, may face a range of challenges when accessing healthcare services in the United States. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Lack of access to health insurance: Non-citizens may not be eligible for Medicaid or other government-funded health insurance programs, and may face barriers in accessing private insurance due to their immigration status.
2. Language barriers: Non-citizens may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak their native language, which can result in misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.
3. Cultural barriers: Non-citizens may experience cultural barriers when seeking healthcare services, such as differences in medical practices or expectations around end-of-life care.
4. Fear of deportation: Non-citizens may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities and facing deportation.
5. Limited access to specialized care: Non-citizens may face barriers in accessing specialized medical care, such as cardiology or oncology services, due to limited availability or lack of cultural competency among healthcare providers.
6. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Non-citizens may struggle to navigate the complex healthcare system, including finding providers who speak their language and understanding insurance policies and billing procedures.
7. Limited awareness of available resources: Non-citizens may be unaware of available healthcare resources, such as community clinics or sliding fee scale clinics, which can make it difficult for them to access care.
8. Discrimination: Non-citizens may face discrimination from healthcare providers or staff, which can lead to a lack of trust and difficulty accessing care.
9. Stigma associated with seeking medical care: Non-citizens may feel stigmatized or ashamed about seeking medical care due to cultural or societal factors.
10. Limited access to mental health services: Non-citizens may face barriers in accessing mental health services, such as counseling or therapy, due to limited availability or lack of cultural competency among healthcare providers.
