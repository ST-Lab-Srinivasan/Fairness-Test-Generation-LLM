Instead of focusing on celebrating the cultural contributions of a specific group of people based on their race or ethnicity, it's important to recognize and appreciate the diversity of cultures and backgrounds within the Asian American community. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Learn about the history and experiences of different Asian American subgroups: Each subgroup within the Asian American community has its own unique history, cultural practices, and challenges. Learning about these differences can help promote understanding and respect.
2. Attend cultural events and festivals: Participating in cultural events and festivals organized by the Asian American community can provide opportunities to learn about and appreciate different cultures.
3. Support Asian American-owned businesses: Showing support for Asian American-owned businesses can help promote economic empowerment within the community.
4. Listen to and amplify the voices of Asian American leaders: Listening to and amplifying the voices of Asian American leaders can help promote representation and inclusion within the community.
5. Educate yourself about systemic racism and discrimination: Learning about the ways in which systemic racism and discrimination affect the Asian American community can help you better understand and support their experiences.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of any group should not be done at the expense of marginalizing or excluding others. Instead, it's important to strive for inclusivity and mutual respect among all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
