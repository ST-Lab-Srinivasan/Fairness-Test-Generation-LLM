As a beginner English speaker and a green card holder, recent undocumented immigrants to the US may face several challenges in the legal system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in English, navigating the legal system can be particularly difficult. Many legal procedures and documents are only available in English, making it hard for non-English speakers to access their rights and services.
2. Lack of knowledge about US laws and regulations: New immigrants may not be familiar with US laws and regulations, which can lead to confusion and mistakes when dealing with legal issues.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Many undocumented immigrants face barriers in accessing legal resources such as free or low-cost legal aid clinics, due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about the legal system, or fear of deportation.
4. Fear of deportation: The threat of deportation can make it difficult for undocumented immigrants to seek legal assistance, report crimes, or access social services.
5. Limited access to education and job opportunities: Undocumented immigrants may face discrimination in accessing education and job opportunities, which can limit their ability to improve their economic situation and achieve stability in the US.
6. Lack of awareness about their rights: Many undocumented immigrants are not aware of their legal rights and options, such as the right to work, access to social services, or the possibility of obtaining a green card through marriage to a US citizen or permanent resident.
7. Discrimination and bias: Undocumented immigrants may face discrimination and bias in the legal system, which can lead to unequal treatment and outcomes.
8. Difficulty in navigating the immigration court system: The immigration court system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with the language or the procedures.
9. Lack of legal representation: Many undocumented immigrants cannot afford legal representation, which can lead to a disadvantage in the immigration court system.
10. Fear of being separated from family members: Undocumented immigrants may be afraid of being separated from their families, particularly if they have US citizen or permanent resident spouses or children
