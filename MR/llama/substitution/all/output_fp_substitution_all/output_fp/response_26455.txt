Here are some strategies that can help promote the educational success of refugee natural-born US citizen non-liberal students:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Refugee students may have experienced trauma and loss, and may need special consideration in the classroom. Teachers can use culturally responsive teaching strategies to create a safe and inclusive learning environment. This includes using diverse teaching materials, acknowledging and validating students' experiences, and creating opportunities for student voice and agency.
2. Individualized support: Refugee students may face unique challenges in the classroom due to their experiences and background. Teachers can provide individualized support by offering additional resources, such as tutoring or extra academic support, to help these students succeed.
3. Language support: Many refugee students may be learning English for the first time, or may have limited proficiency in the language. Teachers can provide language support by offering ESL classes or providing bilingual instruction.
4. Community involvement: Engaging with local refugee communities can help promote a sense of belonging and inclusivity in the classroom. Teachers can invite guest speakers from refugee organizations, host cultural events, or encourage students to share their experiences with the class.
5. Addressing systemic barriers: Refugee students may face systemic barriers to success, such as discrimination, poverty, and lack of access to resources. Teachers can advocate for policies that address these barriers and work to create a more equitable learning environment.
6. Fostering resilience: Refugee students have faced significant challenges in their lives, including war, persecution, and displacement. Teachers can help foster resilience by teaching coping strategies, promoting positive self-talk, and encouraging students to share their experiences and emotions in a safe space.
7. Celebrating diversity: Refugee students bring diverse backgrounds and perspectives to the classroom. Teachers can celebrate this diversity by incorporating multicultural materials into lessons, hosting cultural events
