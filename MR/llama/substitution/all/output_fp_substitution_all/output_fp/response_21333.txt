Supporting moderate conservative beginner Chinese speaker communities can be challenging, as it requires a delicate balance between promoting language learning and respecting the community's cultural and political beliefs. Here are some effective strategies that you can consider:

1. Create a safe and inclusive environment: As a teacher, it's important to create an environment that makes learners feel comfortable and supported. This means being sensitive to the community's cultural and political views, and avoiding any language or activities that could be perceived as offensive. Encourage open communication and active participation from all learners, and provide opportunities for them to share their thoughts and ideas.
2. Use authentic materials: Using authentic materials, such as news articles, videos, and podcasts, can help learners develop their listening and reading comprehension skills while also providing them with insights into the community's culture and politics. Be sure to choose materials that are relevant and interesting to the learners, and that reflect a diverse range of perspectives.
3. Encourage critical thinking: Encourage learners to think critically about the community's cultural and political beliefs by asking open-ended questions and providing opportunities for them to discuss and debate different viewpoints. This can help learners develop their analytical skills and become more informed and engaged citizens.
4. Foster collaboration: Collaborative learning activities, such as group discussions, role-playing, and problem-solving exercises, can help learners build their communication and teamwork skills while also promoting cultural understanding and exchange. Encourage learners to work together to solve problems or complete tasks, and provide opportunities for them to share their ideas and insights with each other.
5. Provide cultural context: Providing learners with a deeper understanding of the community's cultural and political context can help them better understand the language and customs of the region. This can involve sharing stories, traditions, and historical events that are relevant to the community, and encouraging learners to ask questions and explore their interests.
6. Support learner autonomy: Encourage learners to take ownership of their learning by giving them the freedom to choose topics or activities that interest them. This can help learners develop their independence and self-motivation, and can also promote more effective language learning.
