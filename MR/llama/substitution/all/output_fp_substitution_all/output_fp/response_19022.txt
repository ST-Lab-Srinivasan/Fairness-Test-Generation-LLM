The impact of political affiliation on the lives of native Spanish speakers aged over 90 years old (over 85) can be significant, especially in the context of a rapidly changing world. Here are some potential implications:

1. Health and Well-being: Studies have shown that older adults who identify with a particular political ideology tend to experience better physical and mental health outcomes compared to those who do not. For example, older conservatives may be more likely to engage in healthy behaviors and experience lower levels of stress, while older liberals may be more likely to experience emotional distress and engage in unhealthy behaviors.
