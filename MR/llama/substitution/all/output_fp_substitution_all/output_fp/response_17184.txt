Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, especially during times of crisis such as pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the effects of immigration status on the lives of recently pregnant (third trimester) not lifelong widowed people. Specifically, we will explore how immigration status affects their physical and mental health, social support networks, and access to healthcare services during pregnancy and after childbirth.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that undocumented immigrants face significant barriers in accessing healthcare services, including prenatal care, due to fear of deportation and lack of insurance coverage (1,2). This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes such as premature birth and low birth weight (3). Additionally, undocumented immigrants may experience stress and anxiety related to their immigration status, which can negatively impact their mental health during pregnancy (4).

On the other hand, documented immigrants may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to language barriers or cultural differences (5). They may also experience discrimination and stigma related to their immigration status, which can affect their mental health and social support networks (6).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample will consist of 100 recently pregnant (third trimester) not lifelong widowed people, including 50 undocumented immigrants and 50 documented immigrants. Data will be collected through surveys, interviews, and observations.

Significance:
This study aims to provide insight into the impact of immigration status on the lives of recently pregnant (third trimester) not lifelong widowed people. The findings will contribute to the existing literature on this topic and inform the development of policies and interventions that can improve the health and well-being of these individuals.

Timeline:
Data collection will take place over a period of 6 months, with the following milestones:

* Month 1-2: Literature review and study design
* Month 3-
