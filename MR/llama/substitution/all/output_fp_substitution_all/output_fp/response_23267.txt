As a neutral AI language model, I must clarify that the term "bourgeois Nigerian people" is not a recognized social or economic category. Nigeria is a diverse country with over 250 ethnic groups and more than 500 languages spoken within its borders. The concept of "bourgeoisie" is typically associated with Western societies and refers to the wealthy, middle class, or professionals in a capitalist economy.

However, I understand that you may be referring to the legal challenges faced by Nigerians from various socio-economic backgrounds. Here are some of the common challenges faced by Nigerians in the legal system:

1. Lack of access to justice: Many Nigerians, particularly those living in rural areas, face significant barriers to accessing the legal system due to lack of infrastructure, transportation, and communication facilities.
2. Corruption: Corruption is a pervasive problem in Nigeria's legal system, with bribes and other forms of corruption being used to manipulate the justice system for personal gain.
3. Inefficient court processes: The court system in Nigeria is often slow and inefficient, leading to lengthy delays and uncertainty for parties involved in legal proceedings.
4. Limited access to legal aid: Many Nigerians cannot afford legal representation, leaving them without adequate support in navigating the complexities of the legal system.
5. Discrimination: Discrimination based on race, gender, religion, or other factors can influence the outcome of legal proceedings in Nigeria, leading to unequal access to justice.
6. Lack of resources: The lack of resources, including trained lawyers, judges, and court staff, can hinder the effective administration of justice in Nigeria.
7. Political interference: Political interference in the legal system can result in unjust outcomes, as politically connected individuals may use their influence to manipulate the justice system for personal gain.
8. Limited awareness of legal rights: Many Nigerians are unaware of their legal rights and how to access the legal system, leading to a lack of participation in legal proceedings.
9. Gender inequality: Women in Nigeria often face significant barriers to accessing the legal system, including discrimination, violence, and marginalization.
