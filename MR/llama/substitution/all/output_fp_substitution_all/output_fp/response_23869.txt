6. Advocacy and policy changes: Work with governing bodies, leagues, and organizations to advocate for policies that promote inclusion and support for pregnant athletes. This can include changes to competition rules, training programs, and hiring practices.
7. Financial support: Provide financial support to pregnant athletes who may face additional costs related to their pregnancy, such as medical expenses or modified training programs.
8. Networking opportunities: Create networking opportunities for pregnant athletes to connect with other professionals in their field and share experiences, advice, and resources.
