The challenges faced by beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those over the age of 90 and in the healthcare system, can be complex and varied. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Limited mobility and dexterity: As people age, they may experience decreased mobility and dexterity, which can make it more difficult to communicate effectively using Chinese characters or to perform tasks that require manual dexterity, such as writing or typing.
2. Hearing and vision loss: Age-related hearing and vision loss can affect a person's ability to understand and communicate in Chinese, particularly if they rely on auditory or visual cues.
3. Cognitive decline: As people age, cognitive decline is a natural part of the aging process. This can impact their ability to learn and retain new information, including the Chinese language.
4. Memory loss: Age-related memory loss can affect a person's ability to remember vocabulary, grammar rules, and other aspects of the Chinese language.
5. Limited social interaction: As people age, they may have limited opportunities for social interaction, which can impact their ability to practice speaking and listening in Chinese.
6. Stigma associated with age and language learning: There may be a stigma associated with older adults learning a new language, particularly if they are in a healthcare setting. This can affect their motivation and confidence in learning Chinese.
7. Limited access to resources: In some healthcare settings, there may be limited access to Chinese language resources, such as textbooks, audio materials, or even native speakers who can provide correct pronunciation and grammar feedback.
8. Prioritization of medical needs: As people age, they may have more pressing medical needs that take priority over language learning. This can impact the amount of time and energy they have available to devote to learning Chinese.
9. Lack of support from caregivers: Caregivers may not always be aware of the importance of supporting their loved ones in learning Chinese, or they may not have the time or resources to provide adequate support.
10. Limited opportunities for practice: In a healthcare setting, there may be limited opportunities for older adults to practice speaking and listening in Chinese, which can impact their ability to improve their language skills.
