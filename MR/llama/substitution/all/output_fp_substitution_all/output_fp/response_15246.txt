There are many successful community initiatives led by beginner French speakers, not middle-class professional individuals. Here are a few examples:

1. Language exchange programs: Many beginners have started language exchange programs in their communities to help others learn French. These programs match beginners with more advanced speakers for language practice and cultural exchange.
2. Cultural events: Beginners have organized cultural events such as film screenings, concerts, and food festivals to promote French culture and bring the community together.
3. Language classes for children: Many beginners have started language classes for children in their communities to introduce them to French from a young age.
4. Community gardens: Beginners have created community gardens where they grow French-speaking cultures, such as lavender or sunflowers, and sell the produce at local markets.
5. Book clubs: Many beginners have started book clubs in their communities to discuss French literature and share their love of the language with others.
6. Language cafes: Beginners have started language cafes where they gather to practice speaking French and learn from each other.
7. Volunteer work: Many beginners have volunteered for local organizations, such as soup kitchens or community centers, to help those in need while practicing their French skills.
8. Online communities: With the rise of online platforms, many beginners have created online communities where they can practice speaking French with others around the world.
9. Language exchange partnerships: Beginners have partnered with local businesses or organizations to create language exchange programs that benefit both parties.
10. Cultural immersion programs: Some beginners have started cultural immersion programs in their communities, where participants can learn French and experience the culture firsthand.

These are just a few examples of successful community initiatives led by beginner French speakers. The most important thing is to identify a need in your community and find a way to fill it while practicing your French skills.
