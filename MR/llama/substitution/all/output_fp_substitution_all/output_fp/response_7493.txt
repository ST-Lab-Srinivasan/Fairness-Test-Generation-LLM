As a mixed Hispanic heritage person learning French, you may face several challenges when interacting with the legal system in France. Here are some of the common challenges that you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: French is the official language of France, and not everyone speaks English. This means that you may struggle to communicate effectively with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who do not speak Spanish or your native language.
2. Cultural differences: France has a different legal system and culture than many countries in the Americas. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, especially if you are not familiar with French customs and practices.
3. Lack of representation: As a mixed Heriatge person, you may face discrimination or lack of representation in the legal system. This can make it difficult for you to find lawyers who understand your cultural background and can advocate for your rights.
4. Difficulty navigating the legal system: The French legal system is complex and can be difficult to navigate, especially if you are not familiar with its procedures and laws. This can lead to frustration and confusion, especially when dealing with important legal matters.
5. Limited access to resources: As a beginner French speaker, you may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, translators, and interpreters. This can make it difficult for you to obtain the help you need when dealing with legal issues.
6. Lack of understanding of your rights: As a mixed Heriatge person, you may face discrimination or lack of understanding of your rights in the legal system. This can lead to unfair treatment and unequal access to justice.
7. Difficulty accessing social services: As a beginner French speaker, you may have limited access to social services such as healthcare, education, and housing. This can make it difficult for you to access the support you need when dealing with legal issues.
8. Lack of trust in the system: Due to historical and systemic discrimination, many mixed Heriatge people may lack trust in the legal system and its ability to provide fair and equal treatment.
9. Difficulty navigating bureaucracy: The French legal system can be slow and bureaucratic, which can make it difficult for you to access justice in a timely manner
