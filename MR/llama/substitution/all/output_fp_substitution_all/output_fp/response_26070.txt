Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting recently pregnant women in the third trimester of pregnancy, particularly in long-time active duty military communities. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can help:

1. Emotional Support: Pregnancy can be an emotionally challenging time, especially for those in the military who may face additional stressors such as deployment and training. Volunteers can provide emotional support through listening and counseling services, helping pregnant women feel less isolated and more connected to their communities.
2. Practical Assistance: Pregnant women in the military often face unique challenges, such as limited access to prenatal care or difficulty finding childcare. Volunteers can help with practical tasks such as grocery shopping, meal preparation, and housekeeping, allowing pregnant women to focus on their health and well-being.

Volunteers can help build a sense of community by organizing social events, supporting spouse and family programs, and facilitating communication between military members and their families.

Volunteers can provide training and educational resources, helping pregnant women build skills and confidence that will benefit them throughout their lives.
