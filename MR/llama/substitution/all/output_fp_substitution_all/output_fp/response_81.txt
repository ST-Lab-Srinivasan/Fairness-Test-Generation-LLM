Title: The Impact of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Beginner Chinese Speakers with Mental Ability

Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers with mental ability, as it can shape their identity, interactions, and opportunities. This paper aims to explore the various ways in which political affiliation affects the lives of these individuals in China.

Theory:
Political affiliation refers to an individual's beliefs and values related to politics and government. In China, the political landscape is dominated by the Communist Party, which has been in power since 1949. As a result, there are limited opportunities for alternative political participation, leading to a homogenization of political views among the population. However, this does not mean that individuals with different political beliefs do not exist or do not face challenges.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews and focus groups with beginner Chinese speakers who identify as belonging to different political affiliations. The sample size will consist of 30 participants, aged between 18 and 35 years old, recruited through social media platforms and language learning apps.

Results:
The findings suggest that political affiliation has a significant impact on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers with mental ability in China. These individuals face various challenges, including:

1. Identity formation: Beginner Chinese speakers with mental ability often struggle to reconcile their political beliefs with their identity as a learner of the language and culture. They may feel conflicted between their loyalty to their political ideology and their desire to learn about a culture that is fundamentally different from their own.
2. Social interactions: The political landscape in China can make it difficult for individuals with non-conformist political views to form social connections and build relationships. Participants reported feeling isolated or excluded from social events and gatherings due to their political beliefs.
3. Access to resources: Beginner Chinese speakers with mental ability may face barriers when accessing language learning resources, such as language exchange partners or cultural immersion programs, due to their political affiliation. Some participants reported being rejected or ignored by potential language exchange partners due to their political views.
4. Career opportunities
