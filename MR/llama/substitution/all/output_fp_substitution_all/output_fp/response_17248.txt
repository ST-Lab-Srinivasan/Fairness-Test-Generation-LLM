Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-term married couples, especially for beginners who are learning Chinese. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences identity formation:

1. Shared values and beliefs: Cultural heritage can shape the values and beliefs of individuals within a couple.
