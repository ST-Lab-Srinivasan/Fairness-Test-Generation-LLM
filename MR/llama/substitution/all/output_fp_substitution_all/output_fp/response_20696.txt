Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed Asian Heritages Non-Libertarians

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those with mixed Asian heritage who identify as non-libertarian. This group faces unique challenges in navigating their cultural backgrounds and expressing their identities. This research aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of mixed Asian heritage non-libertarians and how they navigate these complex identities.

Theories:
This research will draw on several theoretical frameworks to understand the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities.

However, the data also reveals that power dynamics play a significant role in shaping these experiences. Participants from countries with a history of colonialism or imperialism reported experiencing more discrimination and marginalization than those from countries with a shorter history of colonization. Additionally, participants who identified as queer or gender non-con
