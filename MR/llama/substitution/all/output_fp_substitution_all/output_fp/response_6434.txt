I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to support or encourage any particular political ideology or agenda, including those that may be discriminatory or unethical. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or immigration status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusive and respectful civic engagement practices that value the participation and contribution of all members of society. This can involve:

1. Encouraging open and respectful dialogue: Create opportunities for people with different perspectives to come together and share their thoughts and ideas in a safe and respectful manner.
2. Promoting access to information: Ensure that individuals have access to accurate and unbiased information about local, national, and global issues, so they can make informed decisions and participate in civic discourse.
3. Supporting voter registration and education: Encourage eligible citizens to register to vote and educate them on the voting process and the importance of their voice in shaping the future of their community.
4. Advocating for representation and inclusion: Work to ensure that the voices of underrepresented communities are heard and valued in the civic engagement process, including those of Native American and recent temporary visa holders.
5. Fostering community engagement and participation: Encourage individuals to get involved in their local communities through volunteer work, community organizing, and other forms of civic participation.

Remember, promoting inclusive and respectful civic engagement practices requires ongoing effort and commitment from individuals and organizations. By working together, we can build a more just and equitable society for all.
