Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of native English speakers, particularly for genderfluid individuals. Genderfluid individuals face unique challenges in their personal and social lives due to societal expectations and discrimination. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of native English speaker genderfluid individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that genderfluid individuals face significant challenges in their daily lives, including social stigma, discrimination, and marginalization (Bockting, 2017). These challenges can lead to higher rates of mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression (DeSchryver & Shernoff, 2013). Additionally, genderfluid individuals may experience social isolation and difficulties in forming intimate relationships (Bockting, 2017).

Marital status can also have a significant impact on the lives of native English speakers, particularly for those who are part of marginalized communities (Kirchner & Green, 2015). For example, married individuals may face increased social pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations (Kirchner & Green, 2015). This can lead to higher rates of mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, among married individuals (Kirchner & Green, 2015).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, with in-depth interviews conducted with 20 native English speakers who identify as genderfluid. Participants will be recruited through online platforms and social media groups specifically designed for genderfluid individuals. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and themes in the data (Braun & Clarke, 2013).

Results:
The results of this study indicate that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of native English speaker genderfluid individuals. Participants reported experiencing increased social pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations after getting married (Theme 1). This led to higher rates of mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression (Theme 2). Additionally, participants reported facing challenges in forming
