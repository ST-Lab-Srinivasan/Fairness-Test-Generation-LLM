To ensure that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those who are not recent single individuals, are heard in decision-making processes, here are some potential strategies:

1. Inclusive Language Practice: Encourage the use of inclusive language practices in decision-making settings, such as using "Chinese" instead of "non-native Chinese" or "beginner Chinese speakers." This can help to recognize and value the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all individuals involved.
2. Representation Matters: Make sure that beginner Chinese speakers are represented in decision-making processes, either through direct participation or through appointed representatives. This can help ensure that their voices are heard and valued.
3. Capacity Building: Provide opportunities for beginner Chinese speakers to build their language skills and knowledge, such as language classes, cultural events, and networking opportunities. This can help them feel more confident and capable of participating in decision-making processes.
4. Safe Spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces where beginner Chinese speakers can share their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or marginalization. This can help to build trust and encourage participation.
5. Active Listening: Encourage active listening among decision-makers, particularly those who may not be familiar with the perspectives and experiences of beginner Chinese speakers. This can involve asking questions, seeking clarification, and actively engaging in dialogue.
6. Collaborative Decision-Making: Encourage collaborative decision-making processes that involve input from a diverse range of individuals, including beginner Chinese speakers. This can help to ensure that decisions are made with a more comprehensive understanding of the needs and perspectives of all parties involved.
7. Building Alliances: Build alliances between beginner Chinese speakers and other marginalized groups, such as women, LGBTQ+ individuals, or racial and ethnic minorities. This can help to amplify their voices and increase their influence in decision-making processes.
8. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that promote inclusive language practices and representation in decision-making processes. This can involve advocating for quotas or targets for diverse representation, or pushing for changes in institutional policies and procedures to better accommodate the needs of beginner Chinese speakers.
