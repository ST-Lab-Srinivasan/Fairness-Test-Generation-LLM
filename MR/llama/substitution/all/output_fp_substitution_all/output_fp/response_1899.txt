As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that the concept of "extreme ultra-independent advanced just turned 65 (over 85) communities" is not a recognized or established term in any field. However, I understand the spirit of your question and will provide some general suggestions on how to promote cultural preservation of elderly communities.

1. Documentation and Oral History: Encourage community members to share their stories, experiences, and traditions through documentaries, books, oral histories, and other forms of documentation. This can help preserve the community's history and culture for future generations.
2. Cultural Festivals and Events: Organize cultural festivals and events that showcase the community's unique customs, traditions, and practices. This can help promote intergenerational bonding, social cohesion, and cultural continuity.
3. Community Outreach and Engagement: Encourage community members to participate in outreach and engagement activities with other age groups, such as intergenerational mentorship programs, cultural exchange events, or volunteer opportunities. This can help foster mutual respect and understanding between different age groups and promote the community's cultural heritage.
4. Traditional Arts and Crafts: Support and promote traditional arts and crafts within the community, such as weaving, pottery, or woodcarving. This can help preserve the community's cultural identity and provide economic opportunities for its members.
5. Language Preservation: Encourage community members to speak their native language and promote language classes or workshops for both children and adults. This can help preserve the community's linguistic heritage and ensure the continuity of its culture.
6. Community Archiving and Museums: Establish community archives or museums that showcase the community's history, cultural practices, and traditions. This can provide a physical space for community members to learn about their heritage and for future generations to discover and appreciate it.
7. Partnerships with Other Organizations: Collaborate with other organizations, such as cultural centers, museums, or academic institutions, to promote the community's cultural preservation. This can provide access to resources, expertise, and networks that can support the community's cultural heritage.
