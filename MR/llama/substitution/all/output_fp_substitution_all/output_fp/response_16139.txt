As a language model, I cannot provide legal advice or advocate for specific policy changes. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how legislative changes could potentially benefit beginner English speakers and long-time civilian communities:

1. Language Learning Support: Provide resources and support for language learners, such as free or low-cost language classes, tutoring services, and language exchange programs. This could help bridge the gap between beginner and advanced English speakers.
2. Immigration Reform: Update immigration laws to make it easier and more accessible for non-native English speakers to obtain visas and residency permits. This could enable more individuals to learn and improve their English language skills.
3. Education Reforms: Invest in public education, particularly in underserved communities, to provide quality language instruction from an early age. This could help create a pipeline of English speakers and promote linguistic diversity.
4. Workplace Support: Offer language training programs for employers, particularly those in industries with high concentrations of non-native English speakers. This could help improve communication and productivity within workplaces.
5. Community Outreach: Organize community events and activities that promote cultural exchange and language practice among participants. This could help build bridges between different linguistic groups and foster a sense of belonging.
6. Public Transportation Accessibility: Ensure that public transportation systems are equipped with visual and audio announcements in multiple languages, making it easier for non-native English speakers to navigate public transit.
7. Healthcare Support: Provide language support services in hospitals and clinics, particularly for patients who may not speak the dominant language of their region. This could help ensure that everyone receives equal access to medical care.
8. Local Government Services: Offer language interpretation services at local government offices, such as police stations, city halls, and social service agencies. This could help ensure that non-native English speakers have equal access to public services.
9. Access to Technology: Provide low-cost or free digital tools and resources for language learning, such as language learning apps, e-books, and online courses. This could help bridge the gap between beginner and advanced English speakers in terms of access to technology.
10. Language Diversity Celebration: Organize cultural events
