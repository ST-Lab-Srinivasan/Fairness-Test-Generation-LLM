To ensure that the educational needs of beginner English speakers (documented or undocumented) are met, here are some strategies and approaches that can be implemented:

1. Language Assessment and Placement: Conduct regular language assessments to identify the individual's level of proficiency and place them in an appropriate course or program. This will help ensure that they are learning at their own pace and are challenged appropriately.

This can help build a support network and provide opportunities for individuals to practice their language skills in real-life situations.
