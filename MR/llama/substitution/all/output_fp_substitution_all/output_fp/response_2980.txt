Long-time widowed active duty military personnel may face a range of challenges when entering the civilian job market. Here are some of the common issues they might encounter:

1. Lack of Civilian Work Experience: Military spouses often have gaps in their resume due to frequent moves and deployment. This can make it difficult to demonstrate continuous work experience, which is a key factor in the hiring process.
2. Limited Networking Opportunities: Military spouses may have limited opportunities to network with civilian professionals, as they often find themselves in new locations without established connections.
3. Transferable Skills: Military training and experience may not always translate directly to civilian jobs. Widows may need to learn new skills or reframe their existing skills to make them more relevant to civilian employers.
4. Ageism: Older military spouses may face age-related discrimination, as they may be perceived as less energetic or technologically savvy than younger applicants.
5. Credentialing Issues: Military spouses may struggle to obtain professional certifications or licenses due to frequent moves and lack of access to educational resources.
6. Childcare Responsibilities: Widows with young children may face challenges balancing work and family obligations, as they may need to provide childcare while also managing their own grief and emotional well-being.
7. Stigma: Military spouses may still face social stigma related to their military background, which can make it difficult for them to be taken seriously in the job market.
8. Limited Job Opportunities: Some areas may have limited job opportunities, especially for those without a college degree or specific professional training.
9. Difficulty Adjusting to Civilian Life: Military spouses may struggle to adjust to civilian life after years of living in a military environment. This can make it challenging to adapt to the pace and culture of the workplace.
10. Financial Insecurities: Widows may face financial insecurities, especially if their late husband's income was the primary source of support for the family. They may need to rely on savings or seek financial assistance to get back on their feet.
