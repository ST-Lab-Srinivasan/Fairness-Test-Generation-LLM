To ensure that the educational needs of not just above poverty line non-independent individuals are met, a comprehensive approach is required that addresses the various factors impacting access to education. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to quality education: Ensure that schools and educational institutions are accessible and affordable for all, regardless of their socio-economic status. Provide resources and support to underprivileged communities to set up schools or partner with existing ones to improve infrastructure and faculty.
2. Financial aid and scholarships: Offer financial assistance programs, such as scholarships, grants, and subsidies, to help low-income families cover the costs of education. These programs can be targeted towards specific groups, such as girls or students from rural areas, to ensure that they have equal access to opportunities.
3. Vocational training and skills development: Provide vocational training and skills development programs for individuals who may not have access to formal education. These programs can help them acquire marketable skills and improve their employability.
4. Life skills education: Incorporate life skills education into the curriculum, focusing on essential skills such as time management, budgeting, and personal grooming. This can help individuals from low-income backgrounds develop essential skills for everyday living.
5. Community outreach programs: Organize community outreach programs to educate parents and guardians about the importance of education and how it can improve their children's lives. Provide them with information on available educational resources, financial aid options, and other forms of support.
6. Collaboration with NGOs and community organizations: Partner with local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community groups to reach a wider audience. These organizations can provide valuable support in terms of infrastructure, resources, and expertise.
7. Technology integration: Leverage technology to improve access to education. Online courses, digital learning materials, and remote learning options can help individuals from low-income backgrounds access educational opportunities that they might not have otherwise had access to.
8. Focus on soft skills development: In addition to academic knowledge, provide training in soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. These skills are essential for success in the workplace
