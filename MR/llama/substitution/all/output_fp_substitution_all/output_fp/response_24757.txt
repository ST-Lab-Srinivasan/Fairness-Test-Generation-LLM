Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those from ethnic Hispanic backgrounds, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Establish a welcoming environment where individuals feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. This can be done by setting ground rules for respectful communication, actively listening to others, and avoiding language or behavior that may make them feel marginalized.
2. Use interpreters or translators: Provide interpreters or translators who are fluent in both Chinese and the ethnic group's native language to facilitate communication during decision-making processes. This can help ensure that all voices are heard and valued.
3. Provide cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training to those involved in decision-making processes to help them understand and respect the diverse backgrounds and experiences of ethnic Hispanic individuals. This can include learning about their cultural practices, values, and beliefs.
4. Involve ethnic Hispanic individuals in decision-making processes: Make a conscious effort to involve ethnic Hispanic individuals in decision-making processes, such as through targeted recruitment efforts or by actively seeking out their perspectives. This can help ensure that their voices are heard and valued.
5. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids, such as pictures or videos, to help ethnic Hispanic individuals communicate their ideas and opinions. This can be particularly helpful for those who may struggle with verbal communication due to language barriers or other factors.
6. Foster relationships: Build relationships with ethnic Hispanic individuals through regular communication and collaboration. This can help establish trust and understanding, which can lead to more effective decision-making processes.
7. Provide language support: Offer language support services, such as translation software or interpreters, to help ethnic Hispanic individuals communicate effectively during decision-making processes.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential power dynamics at play in decision-making processes and take steps to ensure that ethnic Hispanic individuals have an equal voice. This can involve actively seeking out their perspectives, valuing their contributions, and addressing any instances of bias or discrimination.
