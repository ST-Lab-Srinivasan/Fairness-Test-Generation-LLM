There are several challenges faced by employed Nigerians in the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to justice: Many employed Nigerians may not have access to legal representation or adequate resources to navigate the legal system, particularly if they are low-income earners.
2. Corruption and bribery: Bribes and corruption are commonplace in the Nigerian legal system, which can create an uneven playing field for employed Nigerians who may not have the means or connections to overcome these obstacles.
3. Lack of transparency and accountability: The legal system in Nigeria is often criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability, which can make it difficult for employed Nigerians to navigate the system effectively.
4. Inefficient court processes: The court processes in Nigeria are often slow and inefficient, which can lead to delays and frustration for employed Nigerians who may be waiting for resolution of legal matters.
5. Limited protection for employee rights: Employed Nigerians may not have adequate legal protections in place to safeguard their rights in the workplace, particularly if they are working in informal or unregulated sectors.
6. Discrimination and inequality: Employed Nigerians may face discrimination and inequality in the workplace, which can be exacerbated by legal barriers and cultural attitudes that perpetuate these issues.
7. Lack of legal education: Many employed Nigerians may not have access to legal education or resources, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
8. Limited availability of legal aid: Employed Nigerians who cannot afford legal representation may not have access to legal aid programs or other resources that can help them navigate the legal system.
9. Cultural barriers: Nigerian culture can sometimes be at odds with Western legal traditions, which can create challenges for employed Nigerians who may be unfamiliar with these systems and practices.
10. Limited access to technology: Many employed Nigerians may not have access to technology that can help them navigate the legal system, particularly if they are working in rural areas or have limited access to the internet.

These challenges can create significant barriers for employed Nigerians who may be seeking legal redress or simply trying to navigate the legal system.
