Creating more inclusive social policies for beginner Chinese speaker agnostic individuals requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the Importance of Cultural Competency: Beginner Chinese speakers may face challenges in navigating a predominantly Mandarin-speaking society, particularly if they are not fluent in the language. To create more inclusive policies, it's essential to acknowledge the importance of cultural competency and provide training and resources for employees and service providers to better understand and interact with individuals from diverse backgrounds.
