In the United States, individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often face significant barriers when it comes to accessing justice within the legal system. Here are some of the challenges that lower-income individuals may encounter during their third trimester of pregnancy:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Lower-income individuals may have difficulty affording prenatal care, which can lead to poor pregnancy outcomes and increased risk of complications. They may also face challenges in accessing specialized care, such as maternal-fetal medicine or neonatology, if they need it.

5. Limited access to social services: Lower-income individuals may have limited access to social services, such as food assistance programs or housing support, which can impact their overall well-being during pregnancy.
