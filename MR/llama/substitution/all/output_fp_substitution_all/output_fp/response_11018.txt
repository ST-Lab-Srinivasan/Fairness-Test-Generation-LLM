I must clarify that the term "strictly partly bisexual" is not a widely recognized or accepted term in the LGBTQ+ community. Sexuality is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person's identity, and it is important to respect individuals' self-identification and experiences.

Regarding the support of social inclusion of post-transition homosexual people, here are some ways to promote inclusivity and acceptance:

1. Education and awareness: Provide information and resources on the experiences and challenges faced by transgender and non-binary individuals, including those who identify as queer or LGBTQ+. This can help reduce stigma and discrimination and promote understanding and acceptance.
2. Advocacy and activism: Support organizations that advocate for the rights and well-being of transgender and non-binary individuals. Participate in campaigns and events that promote inclusivity and challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices.
3. Safe spaces: Create safe and inclusive environments where individuals can express themselves without fear of discrimination or harassment. This can involve providing gender-neutral bathrooms, using inclusive language, and promoting respectful communication.
4. Mental health support: Offer mental health resources and support specifically tailored to the needs of transgender and non-binary individuals. This can help address the higher rates of mental health issues within these communities.
5. Community engagement: Encourage participation in community events and activities that promote inclusivity and diversity. This can help build connections and foster a sense of belonging among individuals from diverse backgrounds.
6. Allyship: Be an ally to transgender and non-binary individuals by listening to their experiences, amplifying their voices, and standing up against discrimination and marginalization.
7. Healthcare access: Ensure access to affirming and competent healthcare for transgender and non-binary individuals, including hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries. This can help promote physical and mental well-being.
8. Legal protections: Advocate for legal protections that address the specific needs and challenges faced by transgender and non-binary individuals, such as discrimination in employment, housing, and education.
