Addressing the Needs of Mentally Able-Bodied Ethnically Full African American Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Disaster response and recovery efforts often focus on meeting the basic needs of affected communities, such as food, shelter, and medical care. However, it is essential to recognize that the needs of individuals with mental health conditions or disabilities can be just as important, if not more so, than those of able-bodied individuals. This is particularly true for ethnically full African American individuals, who may face unique challenges in accessing disaster response services due to systemic barriers and biases.

1. Acknowledge the existing disparities: The first step in addressing the needs of mentally able-bodied ethnically full African American individuals in disaster response is to acknowledge the existing disparities in access to resources and services. Ethnic minorities are more likely to be displaced, injured, or killed during a disaster than non-Hispanic whites (Rooks et al., 2018). Moreover, African Americans are less likely to have emergency supplies, such as food, water, and first aid kits, in their homes compared to non-Hispanic whites (Kim et al., 2017).
2. Train disaster responders on cultural competence: Disaster responders must be trained on cultural competence to effectively serve ethnically full African American communities. This includes understanding the unique cultural and historical experiences of this population, as well as recognizing the role of systemic barriers and biases in shaping their experiences during disasters (Komives et al., 2016).
3. Develop inclusive communication strategies: Effective communication is critical in disaster response, but it can be challenging when working with diverse populations. Disaster responders must develop inclusive communication strategies that take into account the language and cultural preferences of ethnically full African American individuals (Barker et al., 2018).
4. Provide accessible shelter and housing options: Accessible shelter and housing options are essential for ethnically full African American individuals with disabilities, particularly during disasters when they may be at increased risk of injury or displacement. Disaster responders must work to identify and prior
