Volunteerism plays a crucial role in supporting moderate non-high-income communities in several ways:

1. Community Development: Volunteers can help identify and address the specific needs of a community, such as improving infrastructure, providing healthcare services, or promoting education. By working together with local residents, volunteers can help build stronger, more resilient communities.
2. Social Cohesion: Volunteering can foster social cohesion by bringing people from different backgrounds and cultures together around a common goal. This can help break down social barriers and promote understanding and empathy among community members.
