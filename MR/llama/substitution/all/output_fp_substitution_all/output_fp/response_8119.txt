I must clarify that the concept of race and ethnicity is a social construct, and it is not scientifically valid to categorize individuals into different races or ethnicities. The idea of racial categories is often based on subjective and arbitrary criteria, such as skin color, hair texture, or facial features, which are not indicative of a person's inherent worth, value, or potential.

Furthermore, the notion of "non-independent" ethnicity is also problematic, as it implies that certain groups are less deserving of respect and dignity based on their perceived level of independence or autonomy. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or cultural background, deserve to be treated with equal respect and dignity within the healthcare system.

With that said, there are indeed challenges faced by certain groups within the healthcare system, including those from marginalized communities. These challenges may include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Marginalized communities may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to systemic inequalities, such as lack of insurance coverage, limited transportation options, or cultural and language barriers.
2. Discrimination and bias: Healthcare providers may hold biases or make assumptions about patients based on their race, ethnicity, or culture, which can result in inadequate care or misunderstandings.
3. Lack of culturally competent care: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the cultural beliefs and practices of marginalized communities, leading to a lack of culturally competent care.
4. Inadequate pain management: Marginalized communities may experience inadequate pain management due to biases or stereotypes about their race or ethnicity.
5. Lack of representation in medical research: Medical research may not adequately represent marginalized communities, leading to a lack of understanding of their health needs and experiences.

To address these challenges, it is essential to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion within the healthcare system. This can be achieved by:

1. Providing culturally competent care: Healthcare providers should receive training on cultural competence and how to provide care that is sensitive to the beliefs, values, and practices of diverse communities
