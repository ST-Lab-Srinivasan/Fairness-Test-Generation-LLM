I must clarify that the term "devout Muslim extreme soft socialist" is a contradictory and oxymoronic phrase.

This can involve organizing cultural events, workshops, or seminars that highlight the contributions and challenges faced by these communities.
6. Community engagement: Engaging with local communities and involving them in the design and delivery of public services can help ensure that these services are responsive to their needs and preferences. This can
