As a researcher or advocate for bereaved individuals, there are several ways you can use data to highlight the issues faced by bi-lost spouses:

1. Conduct surveys or focus groups: Collect data through surveys or focus groups to understand the experiences and challenges faced by bi-lost spouses. This can help identify common themes and issues, such as financial strain, emotional distress, and social isolation.
2. Analyze government statistics: Utilize government statistics on divorce rates, mortality rates, and other relevant data to understand the demographics of bi-lost spouses and the challenges they face. For example, you could analyze data on the number of divorced individuals in a given age range or population, or compare the mortality rates of widowed individuals to those who are married.
3. Use data visualization tools: Create visualizations of the data you have collected to help communicate the issues faced by bi-lost spouses. For example, you could create a bar chart showing the number of bi-lost spouses in different age groups or a line graph illustrating the change in financial strain over time.
4. Collaborate with experts: Work with experts in the field of grief and loss to analyze data and identify trends in the experiences of bi-lost spouses. This can help provide a more nuanced understanding of the issues faced by this population.
5. Create policy recommendations: Use the data you have collected to inform policy recommendations aimed at addressing the challenges faced by bi-lost spouses. For example, you could advocate for increased financial support or mental health resources for widowed individuals.
6. Develop a database: Create a comprehensive database of bi-lost spouses, including demographic information, financial data, and other relevant details. This can help identify patterns and trends in the experiences of this population and inform future research and advocacy efforts.
7. Use machine learning algorithms: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets and identify patterns in the experiences of bi-lost spouses. For example, you could use natural language processing techniques to analyze online forums and support groups to understand the emotional challenges faced by this population.
8. Conduct case studies: Collect detailed data on a small number of bi-lost spouses through case studies to gain a deeper understanding
