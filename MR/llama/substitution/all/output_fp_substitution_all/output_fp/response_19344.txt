Creating more inclusive community events for beginner French speakers, particularly those from lower-income backgrounds, requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Offer free or low-cost events: Many people may not be able to afford expensive workshops or classes, especially those from lower-income backgrounds. Consider offering free or low-cost events to make them more accessible.
