The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of older adults, particularly those over the age of 90, can be significant and far-reaching. As people age, their risk of developing genetic conditions increases, which can affect their physical, emotional, and social well-being. Here are some potential impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of advanced aged (over 85) veteran people:

1. Increased risk of chronic diseases: Older adults with genetic conditions may be at higher risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. These conditions can significantly impact their quality of life and increase healthcare costs.
2. Decreased physical function: Genetic conditions can cause progressive loss of physical function, making it difficult for older adults to perform daily tasks and maintain independence. This can lead to a decline in overall health and well-being.
3. Mental health concerns: Living with a genetic condition can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues in older adults. These conditions can significantly impact their emotional well-being and relationships with family and friends.
4. Social isolation: Older adults with genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to decreased mobility or loss of interest in social activities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Genetic conditions can lead to stigma and discrimination, particularly if they are visible or impact appearance. Older adults may experience ageism and ableism, which can further affect their mental health and well-being.
6. Financial burden: Managing a genetic condition can be costly, particularly for older adults who may have limited financial resources. This can lead to stress and anxiety related to financial security.
7. Impact on caregivers: Genetic conditions can also impact the lives of caregivers, particularly family members who provide emotional and practical support. Caregivers may experience stress, burnout, and emotional distress due to the demands of caring for a loved one with a genetic condition.
8. Limited access to healthcare: Older adults may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to ageism
