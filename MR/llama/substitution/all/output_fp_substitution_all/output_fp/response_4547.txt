The military status of an individual can have significant impacts on their life, particularly in a country like China where the military holds a lot of power and influence. As a non-democratic country, China's political system is based on the Communist Party of China (CPC), which exercises control over various aspects of society, including the economy, media, education, and civil society.

For native Chinese speakers who are not part of the military or the CPC, there can be several impacts to their lives:

1. Limited political participation: As a non-democratic country, China has a limited political participation system, which means that the power is concentrated in the hands of the CPC. For non-military individuals, there are limited opportunities for political participation, such as voting, running for public office, or participating in civil society organizations.
2. Restricted freedoms: China has a complex system of censorship and surveillance, which can limit the freedom of expression, assembly, and association. For non-military individuals, there are restrictions on what they can say, write, or do, especially if it goes against the government's ideology or policies.
3. Economic opportunities: The Chinese government has a significant influence over the economy, particularly in state-owned enterprises (SOEs). For non-military individuals, there may be limited economic opportunities outside of the SOEs, which can limit their career advancement and financial stability.
4. Social mobility: China's social hierarchy is complex, and the military and CPC hold significant power and influence. For non-military individuals, social mobility may be limited, especially if they are from lower-income backgrounds or do not have connections to the ruling party.
5. Identity and belonging: The military and CPC are seen as symbols of Chinese identity and belonging. For non-military individuals who do not identify with these symbols, there may be feelings of disconnection or exclusion from mainstream Chinese society.
6. Access to education and healthcare: While the Chinese government has made significant investments in education and healthcare, access can be limited for non-military individuals, particularly if they are from lower-income backgrounds.
7. International relations: China's international relations
