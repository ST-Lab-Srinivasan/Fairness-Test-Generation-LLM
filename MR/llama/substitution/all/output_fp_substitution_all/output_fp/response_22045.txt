Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Spanish speakers and average income earners can be achieved by considering the following strategies:

1. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services during the event to help attendees who may not be fluent in Spanish. This can include providing headsets with live interpreters or offering printed materials with translations.
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event location is accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities. Provide wheelchair access, accessible parking, and accessible restrooms.
3. Affordability: Keep the event affordable by offering a sliding scale fee based on income. This can include offering discounts for low-income individuals or providing financial aid to those who cannot afford the full price.
4. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and tailor the event to accommodate diverse backgrounds and experiences. This can include incorporating traditional food, music, and activities from different cultures.
5. Inclusive marketing: Use language and imagery in marketing materials that are inclusive and welcoming to all attendees, regardless of their cultural background or language proficiency.
6. Flexibility: Offer flexible pricing options, such as pay-what-you-can or sliding scale pricing, to make the event more accessible to a wider range of attendees.
7. Volunteer opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for attendees to help with event logistics and organization, which can be a great way to build community and create inclusive environments.
8. Education and outreach: Offer educational workshops or outreach programs before the event to educate attendees on the importance of cultural competence and how to create more inclusive communities.
9. Intergenerational activities: Incorporate activities that bring together people of different ages, such as intergenerational storytelling or art-making workshops.
10. Access to childcare: Provide access to childcare during the event, such as babysitting cooperatives or drop-in childcare services, to make it easier for attendees with young children to participate.

By incorporating these strategies, you can create a more inclusive community event
