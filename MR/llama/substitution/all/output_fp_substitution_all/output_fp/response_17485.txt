The impacts of immigration status on the lives of non-upper middle-income non-liberal people can be significant and varied. Here are some possible effects:

1. Lack of access to basic rights and services: Non-upper middle-income non-liberal countries may have limited resources and infrastructure, which can make it difficult for immigrants to access basic rights and services such as healthcare, education, and social welfare programs.
2. Discrimination and stigma: Immigrants in these countries may face discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status, which can lead to social isolation, marginalization, and mental health problems.
3. Limited job opportunities: Non-upper middle-income non-liberal countries may have limited job opportunities, which can make it difficult for immigrants to find employment and earn a decent living. This can lead to poverty and social exclusion.
4. Difficulty in accessing financial services: Immigrants in these countries may face challenges in accessing financial services such as bank accounts, credit, and insurance due to their immigration status.
5. Limited access to legal protection: Non-upper middle-income non-liberal countries may have limited legal protections for immigrants, which can make it difficult for them to seek redress for any abuses or discrimination they may face.
6. Difficulty in integrating into society: Immigrants in these countries may face challenges in integrating into society due to cultural and language barriers, which can lead to social isolation and marginalization.
7. Limited access to healthcare: Immigrants in non-upper middle-income non-liberal countries may have limited access to healthcare services, which can make it difficult for them to receive adequate medical care and treatment.
8. Difficulty in accessing social welfare programs: Non-upper middle-income non-liberal countries may have limited social welfare programs, which can make it difficult for immigrants to access support and assistance when they need it.
9. Limited political representation: Immigrants in these countries may have limited political representation, which can make it difficult for them to advocate for their rights and interests.
