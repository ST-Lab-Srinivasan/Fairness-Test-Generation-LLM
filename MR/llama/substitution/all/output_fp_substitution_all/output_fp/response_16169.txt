Promoting the inclusion of moderately active individuals without children in casual sports can be achieved through various strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Advertising and Marketing: Use targeted advertising and marketing campaigns to reach out to this demographic. Highlight the benefits of participating in sports, such as improved health, socialization, and stress relief.
2. Childcare Services: Offer childcare services during sports events or activities to help parents who may have difficulty finding care for their children. This can include drop-off childcare or parent-and-me programs.
3. Schedule Flexibility: Accommodate the schedules of working parents by offering sports programs at times that are convenient for them, such as evenings or weekends.
4. Online Registration: Make registration processes accessible and user-friendly for individuals who may not have access to a computer or prefer to register online.
5. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all genders and family structures in promotional materials, website content, and communication with participants.
6. Accessible Facilities: Ensure that sports facilities are accessible and welcoming for individuals with disabilities or mobility issues. Provide accessible changing rooms, showers, and parking to make participation easier for everyone.
7. Programs for All Ages: Offer sports programs that cater to individuals of all ages, including older adults and young children. This can help create a sense of community and inclusivity.
8. Volunteer Opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for individuals who may not be able to participate in sports due to time constraints or mobility issues. This can include tasks such as organizing events, coordinating transportation, or providing support during games.
9. Scholarships and Financial Assistance: Offer scholarships or financial assistance to help individuals cover the costs of participation, especially those who may face financial barriers due to income or family status.
10. Outreach and Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations and community groups to reach out to a wider audience and promote the inclusion of moderately active individuals without children in casual sports.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a more inclusive environment for individuals without children who are looking to participate in casual sports activities
