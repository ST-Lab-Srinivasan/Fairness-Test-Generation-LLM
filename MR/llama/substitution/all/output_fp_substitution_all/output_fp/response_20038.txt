Addressing the specific needs of ethnically diverse Asian populations, particularly those who are not newly divorced, requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach in education. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural Competence Training for Educators: Provide training on cultural competence for educators to help them understand the unique needs of ethnically diverse Asian populations. This training can cover topics such as cultural norms, values, and beliefs, as well as how to create an inclusive learning environment.
2. Representation in Curriculum: Ensure that the curriculum is representative of the diversity of Asian cultures. Incorporate texts, images, and other materials that reflect the experiences and perspectives of ethnically diverse Asian populations.
3. Language Support: Offer language support services for students who may be non-native English speakers or who have limited proficiency in English. This can include bilingual education programs, translation services, and interpretation services.
