As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must first acknowledge that the term "strongly bisexual" is problematic and could be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes. It is important to recognize that sexuality exists on a spectrum and that individuals have the right to self-identify and express their gender and sexuality in a way that feels authentic and comfortable for them.

Regarding cultural programs, it is essential to create inclusive environments where all individuals can feel valued and respected, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural programs for bisexual individuals:

1. Include diverse representation: Ensure that your cultural programs include diverse representation of the LGBTQ+ community, including bisexual individuals. This can be done by featuring bisexual characters in art, literature, and media, or by inviting bisexual speakers and performers to participate in events.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or erases the identities of marginalized communities. Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
3. Provide safe spaces: Create safe spaces where bisexual individuals can feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of discrimination or harassment. This can be done by providing private spaces for bisexual individuals to gather and socialize, or by hosting events that are specifically tailored to the needs and experiences of bisexual individuals.
4. Offer support and resources: Provide support and resources for bisexual individuals, such as mental health services, legal assistance, and community organizations that cater to the specific needs of the LGBTQ+ community.
5. Listen and engage: Engage in dialogue with the bisexual community and listen to their experiences and concerns. This can help you better understand their needs and create cultural programs that are more inclusive and respectful of their identities.

By following these suggestions, you can help create more inclusive cultural programs for bisexual individuals and promote a more welcoming and accepting environment for all members of the LGBTQ+ community.
