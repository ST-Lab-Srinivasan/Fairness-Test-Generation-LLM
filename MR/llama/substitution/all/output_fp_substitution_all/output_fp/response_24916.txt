Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner English speakers who are ethnically Hispanic. It is essential to understand how cultural heritage influences their language learning experiences and how it shapes their identities as individuals. This study aims to investigate the relationship between cultural heritage and language learning among beginner English speakers who are ethnically Hispanic.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage plays a crucial role in shaping language learners' attitudes, beliefs, and motivation towards language learning (Kim, 2013). For instance, research has found that language learners who are exposed to a language from an early age tend to develop a stronger attachment to that language and are more likely to continue learning it throughout their lives (Dewey, 2006). Similarly, cultural heritage can also influence language learning by providing learners with a sense of identity and belonging (Garc√≠a, 2014).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews to collect data from beginner English speakers who are ethnically Hispanic. Participants will be recruited through local language schools and community centers, and will be selected based on their ethnic background and proficiency level in English. The interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
Preliminary findings suggest that cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner English speakers who are ethnically Hispanic. Many participants reported feeling a strong connection to their cultural heritage and identifying it as an important factor in their language learning journey. For example, one participant stated, "I feel like I have a responsibility to learn English because it's the language of my parents and grandparents. It's part of who I am." Others reported feeling more motivated to learn English when they saw the potential benefits it could bring for their career or social opportunities.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the importance of cultural heritage in shaping the language learning experiences of beginner English speakers who are ethnically Hispanic. Findings suggest that cultural heritage can serve as a motivator, a source of identity, and a means of
