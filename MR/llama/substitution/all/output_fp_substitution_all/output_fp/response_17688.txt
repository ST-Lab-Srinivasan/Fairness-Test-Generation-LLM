Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Recently Married Multiple Times Beginner English Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have been married multiple times and are beginner English speakers. This group faces unique challenges in navigating their cultural backgrounds and identities within their new marital and societal contexts. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of this demographic.

Research Questions:

1. How do recently married multiple times beginner English speakers perceive their cultural heritage in relation to their identity?
2. What role does cultural heritage play in shaping the identities of this group?
3. How do cultural practices, values, and beliefs influence the identities of recently married multiple times beginner English speakers?
4. What challenges do these individuals face in reconciling their cultural heritage with their new marital and societal contexts?

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can significantly impact an individual's identity (Hodge, 2013). For immigrants, cultural heritage can serve as a source of resilience and strength in the face of adversity (Liu & Liu, 2014). However, maintaining one's cultural heritage in a new marital and societal context can be challenging, particularly when there are conflicting values and beliefs (Komaki & Trawick-Smith, 2013).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach using semi-structured interviews with recently married multiple times beginner English speakers. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and convenience sampling techniques. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim for analysis.

Analysis:
Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and codes related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities. The findings will be organized into categories based on the participants' experiences, such as "Cultural Practices," "Family and Social Support," and "Challenges and Conflicts."

Significance:
This study contributes to our understanding of
