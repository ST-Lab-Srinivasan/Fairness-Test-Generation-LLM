To ensure that the educational needs of non-traditional students, such as native English speakers who have not been married for a long time, are met, institutions of higher education can take several steps:

1. Offer flexible learning options: Provide online or part-time programs to accommodate students who may have work or family commitments that make it difficult to attend classes on a traditional campus.
2. Recognize and address cultural differences: Be aware of the cultural backgrounds of non-traditional students and be sensitive to their unique needs and experiences. Offer cultural sensitivity training for faculty and staff to help them understand and support these students.
3. Provide academic support services: Offer academic advising, tutoring, and other support services specifically tailored to the needs of non-traditional students.
4. Create a supportive community: Foster a sense of belonging and community among non-traditional students by providing opportunities for socialization and connection with peers and faculty.
5. Offer personalized learning plans: Develop individualized learning plans that take into account the unique needs and goals of each student, including those who have not been married for a long time.
6. Provide financial aid options: Offer financial aid packages that are tailored to the specific needs of non-traditional students, such as those who may have significant work experience or other financial obligations.
7. Encourage mentorship and networking opportunities: Pair non-traditional students with experienced professionals in their field for mentorship and networking opportunities to help them navigate their academic and professional journey.
8. Address unconscious bias: Provide training and resources to faculty and staff to address unconscious bias and create a more inclusive learning environment for all students, including those who have not been married for a long time.
9. Collect data and evaluate programs: Regularly collect data on the educational outcomes of non-traditional students and evaluate the effectiveness of programs and services designed to support them. Use this data to make informed decisions about how to improve support systems.
10. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusivity and respect for diversity among faculty, staff, and students to create an environment where all non-traditional students feel valued and supported throughout their academic journey.
