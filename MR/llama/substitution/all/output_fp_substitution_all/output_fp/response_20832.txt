4. Cultural competency training: Provide cultural competency training for staff and volunteers to help them understand and appreciate different cultures. This can include workshops on cultural sensitivity, diversity, and inclusion.
5. Community involvement: Involve the community in the development and implementation of cultural programs. Encourage community members to participate in program planning and decision-making processes.
