Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of natural-born Indian citizens and recent green card holders to the US. It shapes their identities, influences their beliefs and values, and connects them to their communities. Here are some ways cultural heritage affects these individuals:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular community or group. For natural-born Indian citizens, it helps them connect with their roots and feel proud of their cultural identity. Similarly, recent green card holders to the US can use cultural heritage to establish a sense of belonging in their new country.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage influences how individuals form their identities. It shapes their beliefs, values, and behaviors, and helps them understand who they are and where they come from. For example, natural-born Indian citizens may identify themselves as Indian-American, while recent green card holders to the US may see themselves as both Indian and American.
3. Preservation of traditions: Cultural heritage can help preserve traditional practices, customs, and beliefs. For instance, natural-born Indian citizens may continue to celebrate Indian festivals and rituals in the US, while recent green card holders may introduce these traditions to their new community.
