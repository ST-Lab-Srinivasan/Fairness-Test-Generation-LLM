Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers who are undocumented recent refugees in the US requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the cultural program is accessible to all, regardless of their immigration status or ability to pay. Offer free or low-cost programs and make sure they are located in areas that are convenient for refugees to reach.
2. Language support: Provide language support for beginner French speakers by offering interpreters, translation services, or bilingual staff. This will help ensure that everyone can participate and enjoy the program without feeling left out.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural backgrounds of the refugees and create programs that are inclusive and respectful of their traditions. Avoid using stereotypes or perpetuating harmful representations of their cultures.
4. Community engagement: Involve the local refugee community in the planning and execution of the cultural program. This will help build trust and ensure that the program is tailored to meet their needs and interests.
5. Collaboration with organizations: Partner with organizations that support refugees, such as resettlement agencies or advocacy groups. These organizations can provide valuable resources and expertise in creating culturally sensitive programs.
6. Flexibility: Be flexible and adaptable when designing the cultural program. Take into account the diverse needs and preferences of the refugee population, and be willing to make changes as needed.
7. Education and awareness: Offer educational workshops or events that raise awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by undocumented recent refugees in the US. This can help build empathy and understanding among the broader community.
8. Cultural events: Organize cultural events that showcase the diversity of the refugee population, such as music performances, art exhibitions, or food festivals. These events can help promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
9. Online resources: Provide online resources, such as videos, podcasts, or social media content, that cater to the needs of beginner French speakers who are undocumented recent refugees. This can help them access cultural programs and information remotely.
