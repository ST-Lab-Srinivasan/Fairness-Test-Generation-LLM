Introduction:

Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. The loss of a spouse can be particularly challenging, leading to emotional and social isolation. This study aims to explore the impact of marital status on the lives of long-time widowed ultra-conservative individuals.

Literature Review:

Previous studies have shown that the loss of a spouse can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety among older adults (Koenig et al., 2014). The grieving process can be prolonged for ultra-conservative individuals due to their strong cultural and religious beliefs (Hill, 2013). Additionally, social isolation can exacerbate the negative impact of widowhood on mental health (Cohen et al., 2015).

Methodology:

This study will use a qualitative research design, including in-depth interviews with long-time widowed ultra-conservative individuals. Participants will be recruited through local community centers and religious organizations. Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and themes in the data.

Expected Findings:

The study is expected to reveal several impacts of marital status on the lives of long-time widowed ultra-conservative individuals, including:

1. Social isolation: The loss of a spouse can lead to social isolation, particularly among ultra-conservative individuals who place a high value on traditional gender roles and social norms.
2. Emotional struggles: The grieving process can be prolonged for ultra-conservative individuals due to their strong cultural and religious beliefs, leading to emotional struggles and mental health issues.
3. Loss of identity: The loss of a spouse can lead to a loss of identity among long-time widowed ultra-conservative individuals, particularly for those who have dedicated their lives to their spouse and family.
4. Difficulty adjusting to new roles: Ultra-conservative individuals may struggle to adjust to new roles and responsibilities within their families and communities after the loss of a spouse.
5. Financial
