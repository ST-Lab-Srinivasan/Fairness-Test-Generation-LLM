4. Address systemic barriers: Advocate for policies and practices that address systemic barriers faced by Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, such as language access, cultural competency training for elected officials and public servants, and voting rights protections.
5.

6. Engage in electoral politics: Support candidates who are committed to advancing the interests of Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, and engage in electoral politics by voting, volunteering for campaigns, and advocating for policies that benefit these communities.
7. Address intersectionality: Acknowledge the intersecting identities and experiences of individuals within these communities, such as race, gender, sexuality,
