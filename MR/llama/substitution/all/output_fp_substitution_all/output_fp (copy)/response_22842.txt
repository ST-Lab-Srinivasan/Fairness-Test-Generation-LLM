Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native Arabic speakers who are ethnically Hispanic requires an understanding of the unique needs and experiences of this community. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive cultural programs:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the perspectives of Native Arabic speakers are represented in the program's planning and implementation. This can be achieved by involving community members in the decision-making process and incorporating their feedback into the program.
2. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services during cultural programs to ensure that all participants can understand and participate fully. This can include providing Arabic interpretation, as well as other languages spoken by members of the community.
3. Address cultural sensitivities: Be mindful of cultural sensitivities when designing cultural programs. For example, avoid using imagery or language that may be offensive to Native Arabic speakers. Instead, focus on highlighting commonalities and promoting cross-cultural understanding.
4. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that the program's physical space is accessible and inclusive for all participants. This can include providing wheelchair accessibility, gender-neutral bathrooms, and other accommodations as needed.
5. Offer culturally specific programming: Develop programs that cater to the unique cultural needs and interests of Native Arabic speakers. For example, offer workshops on traditional Arabic music or dance, or host events that celebrate Arabic culture and heritage.
6. Build partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations that serve Native Arabic speakers to co-create cultural programs. This can help ensure that the program is tailored to the specific needs and interests of this community.
7. Provide education and training: Offer educational workshops or training sessions on cultural competency and sensitivity for staff and volunteers involved in the program. This can help ensure that all participants feel welcome and included.
8. Engage with local leaders: Work with local leaders and elders to ensure that the program is culturally appropriate and respectful of Native Arabic speakers' traditions and practices.
9. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for older and younger community members to connect and learn from each other. This can help build bridges
