I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination, including racism or xenophobia, towards any particular group of people. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.

It is important to recognize that cultural contributions come from a diverse range of sources, and it is not appropriate to limit the celebration of cultural contributions to any one particular group. Cultural diversity and inclusivity are essential for creating a society that values and respects the perspectives and experiences of all individuals.

Instead of focusing on ethnic or political affiliations, it is more productive to celebrate the cultural contributions of individuals based on their skills, talents, and achievements. This can involve recognizing and appreciating the unique perspectives and experiences of different cultures and communities, and promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchange.

In short, it is important to recognize and celebrate the cultural contributions of all individuals, regardless of their ethnicity or political beliefs, in a way that promotes inclusivity, respect, and appreciation for diversity.
