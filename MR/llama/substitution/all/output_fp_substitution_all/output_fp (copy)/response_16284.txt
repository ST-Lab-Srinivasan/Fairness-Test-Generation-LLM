Supporting strong atheist communities, especially in the 90+ age range, can be challenging but there are several effective strategies that can help foster a supportive and inclusive environment. Here are some ideas:

1. Create intergenerational connections: Encourage interactions between older atheists and younger ones through activities like mentorship programs, book clubs, or social events. This can help bridge the gap between different age groups and create a sense of community.
2. Foster inclusive spaces: Ensure that your community is welcoming and inclusive to all, regardless of age, gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation. Create safe spaces for people to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination.
3. Encourage critical thinking and skepticism: Atheist communities should encourage critical thinking and skepticism in all its forms. Organize discussions, debates, or workshops on topics like science, philosophy, and critical thinking to help members develop their skills and challenge their beliefs.
4. Promote activism and advocacy: Encourage members to engage in activism and advocacy for causes they believe in, such as separation of church and state, LGBTQ+ rights, or women's rights. This can help create a sense of purpose and belonging within the community.
5. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to members who may be experiencing discrimination, harassment, or other forms of oppression. This could include mental health support, legal advice, or simply being a listening ear.
6. Celebrate milestones and achievements: Atheist communities should celebrate the achievements and milestones of their members, whether personal or professional. This can help build a sense of camaraderie and support within the community.
7. Engage in outreach and education: Organize outreach events, lectures, or workshops to educate the public about atheism and the benefits of secularism. This can help create a positive image of atheists and promote understanding and acceptance.
8. Create a sense of belonging: Encourage members to participate in community events, volunteer opportunities, or social gatherings. This can help create a sense of belonging and connection among members, which is essential
