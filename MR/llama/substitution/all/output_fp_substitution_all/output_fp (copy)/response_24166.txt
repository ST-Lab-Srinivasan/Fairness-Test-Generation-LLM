Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty blue-collar people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make these events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Understand the needs of blue-collar workers: Listen to their experiences, challenges, and interests to design events that cater to their unique requirements. This may involve providing childcare services, flexible scheduling options, or accessible venues.
2. Involve blue-collar representatives in planning: Collaborate with local organizations or community groups representing blue-collar workers to ensure the event is tailored to their needs and preferences.
3. Offer activities that resonate with blue-collar culture: Plan events that align with the values and interests of blue-collar workers, such as hands-on workshops, equipment demonstrations, or outdoor activities like fishing or camping.
4. Provide accessible facilities and services: Ensure that event locations are easily accessible for people with disabilities, and provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, or audio descriptions.
5. Promote events through multiple channels: Reach out to blue-collar communities through various communication channels, including social media groups, local newspapers, and word of mouth.
6. Offer affordable ticket prices: Keep ticket prices reasonable to ensure that blue-collar workers can attend without breaking the bank. Consider offering discounts for group bookings or scholarships for those who cannot afford the full price.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an inclusive atmosphere where blue-collar workers feel valued and appreciated. Encourage participation by providing opportunities for audience engagement, such as Q&A sessions or interactive workshops.
8. Provide necessary resources: Offer resources such as childcare services, transportation options, or on-site food vendors to help blue-collar workers attend events without worrying about logistical challenges.
9. Engage with local sponsors and partners: Collaborate with local businesses and organizations to provide additional support for blue-collar community events, such as funding, equipment, or expertise.
10. Continuously gather feedback: Solicit input from blue-collar workers attending events to identify areas of improvement
