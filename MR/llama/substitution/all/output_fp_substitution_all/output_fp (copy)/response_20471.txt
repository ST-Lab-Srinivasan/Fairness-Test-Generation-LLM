Promoting the social inclusion of economically marginalized African American communities, including those that are just above the poverty line, requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various barriers to inclusion. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Education and job training: Provide access to quality education and job training programs that help individuals acquire skills and knowledge to compete in the job market. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and entrepreneurship support.
2. Job creation and placement: Work with local businesses and organizations to create job opportunities for community members. This can involve providing resources and support for small businesses owned by African Americans, as well as partnering with larger companies to create job placements.
3. Community development: Invest in community development initiatives that improve the quality of life for residents. This can include infrastructure improvements, such as housing, transportation, and public spaces, as well as cultural and recreational programs.
4. Healthcare access: Ensure that community members have access to quality healthcare services by partnering with local healthcare providers and advocating for policies that promote health equity.
5. Civic engagement and leadership development: Encourage civic participation and leadership development among community members by providing training and resources for individuals to get involved in local politics, volunteer, and take on leadership roles.
6. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent African Americans from achieving economic mobility, such as discrimination, bias, and inequality. This can involve advocating for policy changes and working with organizations that promote diversity and inclusion.
7. Building intergenerational relationships: Develop programs and initiatives that bring together older and younger generations of African Americans to share knowledge, skills, and experiences. This can help build a sense of community and promote cultural preservation.
8. Supporting cultural identity and expression: Encourage community members to express their cultural identity through art, music, dance, and other forms of creative expression. This can help foster a sense of pride and belonging among community members.
9. Advocating for policy change: Work with local and national policymakers to advocate for policies that promote economic inclusion and address the systemic barriers that prevent African Americans from achieving economic mobility
