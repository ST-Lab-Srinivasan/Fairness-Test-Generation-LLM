Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting advanced older adults (those over 90 years old) and extreme soft liberal communities. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can contribute to these groups:

1. Social Connection: Volunteering provides opportunities for older adults to connect with others, alleviating feelings of loneliness and isolation. Advanced older adults may face challenges in forming and maintaining social connections due to declining health or mobility issues. Volunteer work can help them stay engaged with their communities and provide a sense of belonging.
2. Purpose and Meaning: Volunteering can give older adults a sense of purpose and meaning, which is essential for overall well-being. Advanced older adults may struggle with the loss of their previous roles or identity, and volunteer work can help them find new ways to contribute and make a positive impact.
3. Skill Sharing: Older adults have extensive life experience and knowledge that can be shared with younger generations through volunteering. They can impart skills and wisdom to others, such as conflict resolution, communication, or leadership, which can benefit the community as a whole.
4. Health Benefits: Volunteering has been shown to have numerous health benefits for older adults, including reduced risk of depression, improved cognitive function, and better physical health. Advanced older adults may particularly benefit from volunteer work, as it can help them maintain their physical and mental health.
5. Community Building: Volunteering can help build stronger, more resilient communities by fostering collaboration and cooperation among individuals of different ages and backgrounds. Advanced older adults can play a vital role in this process, serving as mentors or leaders within the community.
6. Advocacy: Older adults who are extreme soft liberals may use volunteerism as a means of advocating for their political beliefs and values. They can channel their passion and energy into causes that align with their worldview, such as social justice, environmental protection, or LGBTQ+ rights.
7. Intergenerational Connection: Volunteering can provide opportunities for older adults to connect with younger generations, fostering intergenerational relationships and understanding. This can help break down ageist stereotypes and promote mutual respect between different age groups.
