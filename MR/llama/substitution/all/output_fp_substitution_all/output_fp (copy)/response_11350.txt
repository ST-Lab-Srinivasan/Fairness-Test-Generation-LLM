As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "elite natural-born Canadian citizen people" is not a legally recognized category. Canadian law recognizes individuals as either Canadian citizens or non-citizens, regardless of their birthplace or parentage.

However, some challenges that individuals may face in the legal system in Canada include:

1. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, or other personal characteristics is still prevalent in Canadian society and can affect individuals' experiences in the legal system.
2. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in English or French, the official languages of Canada, navigating the legal system can be challenging.
3. Access to justice: Ensuring equal access to justice for all individuals, regardless of their socio-economic status or background, is an ongoing challenge in Canada.
4. Disparities in the administration of justice: Studies have shown that there are disparities in the way that the legal system treats individuals from different racialized and marginalized communities, leading to unequal outcomes in the criminal justice system.
5. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system must be culturally competent and sensitive to the needs of diverse communities. This includes understanding the cultural practices and beliefs of Indigenous peoples, as well as the experiences of racialized and marginalized communities.
6. Gender bias: Gender bias can affect the way that individuals are treated in the legal system, particularly for women and non-binary individuals.
7. Ageism: Older adults may face ageism in the legal system, which can result in unequal treatment under the law.
8. Disability discrimination: Individuals with disabilities may face discrimination in the legal system, including barriers to accessing justice and unequal treatment under the law.
9. Socio-economic status: Individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds may face barriers to accessing justice, including lack of resources and information about their legal rights and options.
10. Intersectionality: The legal system must take into account the intersectionality of individuals' identities, including race, gender, sexuality, and other factors that may impact their experiences
