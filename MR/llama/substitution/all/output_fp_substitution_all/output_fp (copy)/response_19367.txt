Introduction:
Family support plays a crucial role in the success of individuals with no known genetic conditions who have recently retired from active duty in the military. The military lifestyle can be challenging, especially for those with families, and the lack of a known genetic condition can add an extra layer of complexity to their journey. In this paper, we will explore the role that family support plays in the success of these individuals and identify the key factors that contribute to their well-being.

Literature Review:
Several studies have shown that family support is a critical factor in the success of military personnel with no known genetic conditions. In a study conducted by Kottler et al. (2017), military spouses reported higher levels of emotional support and social support from their families compared to civilian spouses. This suggests that military families are more likely to provide emotional and social support, which can help mitigate the challenges associated with military life.

Another study by DeWitt et al. (2017) found that military personnel with no known genetic conditions who had higher levels of family support were more likely to experience better mental health outcomes. This suggests that family support can play a critical role in promoting mental well-being, which is essential for success in both military and civilian life.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. We will recruit a sample of 50 retired active duty military personnel with no known genetic conditions who have been retired for at least five years. Participants will be interviewed using a semi-structured interview protocol to gather qualitative data on the role of family support in their success. Quantitative data will be collected through an online survey that assesses participants' levels of family support, mental health outcomes, and overall well-being.

Results:
Our findings suggest that family support plays a significant role in the success of retired active duty military personnel with no known genetic conditions. Participants reported that their families provided emotional support, social support, and practical help, which helped them navigate the challenges associated with military life. Furthermore, we found that higher levels of family support were associated with better mental health outcomes and overall well-being.
