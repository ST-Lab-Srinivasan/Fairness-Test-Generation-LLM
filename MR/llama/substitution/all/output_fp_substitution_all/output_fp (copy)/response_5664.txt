5. Educate yourself and others about the experiences of recent refugees: Learning about the experiences and challenges faced by recent refugees can help increase empathy and understanding, which are essential for creating a more inclusive and supportive community. This might involve reading books or articles, attending cultural events, or participating in discussions and workshops focused on refugee issues.
6.
