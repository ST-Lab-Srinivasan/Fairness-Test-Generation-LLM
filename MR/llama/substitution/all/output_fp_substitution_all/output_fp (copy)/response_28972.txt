There are several ways to ensure that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those who have been divorced for a long time and may feel marginalized or excluded from decision-making processes, are heard:

1. Create safe spaces for expression: Provide opportunities for these individuals to express themselves in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. This could be through regular meetings or workshops where they can share their thoughts and feelings without fear of criticism or rejection.
2. Use accessible language: When communicating with beginner Chinese speakers, use language that is easy to understand and free from jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to them. Be mindful of the level of complexity and ensure that everyone has a basic understanding of the topic being discussed.
3. Build trust and rapport: Take the time to build relationships with these individuals, listen to their concerns, and show empathy and support. By doing so, you can create an environment where they feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.
4. Encourage participation: Actively seek out the input of beginner Chinese speakers in decision-making processes. Use techniques such as brainstorming or consensus-building to involve them in the decision-making process.
5. Provide translation support: Offer translation support during meetings or discussions to ensure that everyone can fully participate and understand what is being discussed. This can help bridge the language gap and create a more inclusive environment.
6. Educate on power dynamics: Awareness of power dynamics can help beginner Chinese speakers navigate decision-making processes more effectively. Educate them on how to assert their voices, how to navigate conflicts, and how to build alliances with others.
7. Create a mentorship program: Pair beginner Chinese speakers with more experienced individuals who can provide guidance and support in navigating decision-making processes. This can help build confidence and skills among the beginner speakers.
8. Use technology: Utilize technology such as video conferencing or online platforms to create virtual spaces for discussion and decision-making. This can help increase accessibility and inclusivity, particularly for those who may face barriers to in-person participation.
9. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion within the organization or community, where the voices of all individuals are valued
