2. Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development: Encourage entrepreneurship and small business development in these communities by providing access to capital, mentorship, and resources. This can help create job opportunities and generate income for the community.
3. Job Training and Placement: Offer job training programs that focus on in-demand skills such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy. Provide placement services to connect individuals with job opportunities and help them advance in their careers.
