Introduction:
Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of young adults (20s) who are not in a romantic relationship. These individuals may face unique challenges and opportunities that can shape their personal, social, and professional lives. This paper will examine the impacts of military status on the lives of non-romantically involved young adults and identify potential strategies for promoting well-being and resilience.

Personal Impacts:

1. Identity Formation: Military status can influence an individual's sense of self and identity, particularly during a time of transition or change. Non-romantically involved young adults may struggle with feelings of isolation or disconnection from their peers, leading to identity issues (Kelly et al., 2017).
2. Emotional Regulation: Military training can emphasize discipline and control over emotions, which can sometimes lead to difficulties in expressing emotions or forming close relationships (Hackney & Barker, 2016). Non-romantically involved young adults may need to navigate these challenges while managing their emotions in everyday life.
3. Social Isolation: Military culture can prioritize loyalty and duty over personal relationships, which can lead to social isolation for non-romantically involved individuals (Hackney & Barker, 2016). They may find it challenging to form meaningful connections with peers or establish a sense of belonging outside of their military community.
4. Stigma and Discrimination: Non-romantically involved young adults in the military may face stigma or discrimination based on their relationship status (Kelly et al., 2017). This can lead to feelings of shame, inadequacy, or low self-esteem, which can impact mental health and well-being.

Professional Impacts:

1. Career Advancement: Military service can provide opportunities for career advancement and professional growth (Liu et al., 2018). Non-romantically involved young adults may face challenges in balancing their military commitments with professional aspirations, particularly if they are not sure how their relationship status will affect their career prospects.
