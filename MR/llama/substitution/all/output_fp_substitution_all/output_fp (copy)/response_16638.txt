Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Spanish speakers, especially those in their 50s, requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some ideas to make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Use visual aids: Provide visual aids such as posters, flyers, and presentations in both English and Spanish to help beginners understand the material. This can also help them feel more comfortable during the event.
