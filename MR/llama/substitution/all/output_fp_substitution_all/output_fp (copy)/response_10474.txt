5. Clear communication: Use clear and simple language in event promotions and programming, and provide detailed information about the event layout, schedule, and accommodations.
6. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by minimizing loud noises, bright lights, or strong smells that may overwhelm individuals with sensory processing challenges.
7. Inclusive programming: Offer programming that is inclusive and engaging for all attendees, such as interactive workshops, performances, or lectures that cater to diverse interests and abilities.
8. Collaborate with disability organizations: Partner with local disability organizations to consult on accessibility needs and to promote the event to their networks.
