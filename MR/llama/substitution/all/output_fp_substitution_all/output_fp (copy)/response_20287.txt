4. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure the monastic space is welcoming and inclusive for all participants, regardless of their language proficiency. This can be achieved by providing clear instructions, using visual aids, and creating a friendly and supportive atmosphere.
5. Offer beginner-friendly classes: Develop classes or workshops specifically designed for beginner Spanish speakers. These classes can cover basic Buddhist teachings, meditation practices, and other cultural aspects of the monastic community.
6. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as videos, images, and diagrams to help explain complex concepts and practices. This can be especially helpful for beginner Spanish speakers who may struggle with written or spoken language.

8. Provide interpretation services: Offer interpretation services during meditation sessions, lectures, or other cultural programs for those who may not speak Spanish fluently. This can help ensure that all participants can fully engage with the program.
9. Offer online resources: Create an online platform or website with resources specifically tailored to beginner Spanish speakers. This can include audio recordings, video tutorials, and written materials in Spanish.
