Here are some ways that cultural heritage impacts the lives of these individuals:

4. Community building: Cultural heritage can be a powerful tool for building community among mixed Asian heritage individuals. Sharing cultural practices and traditions can help create a sense of belonging and connection among peers.

Preserving cultural traditions and practices can help bridge intergenerational divides, fostering understanding and respect between older and younger family members.

Cultural heritage can provide a sense of pride and resilience in the face of such discrimination, helping individuals navigate difficult social situations.
