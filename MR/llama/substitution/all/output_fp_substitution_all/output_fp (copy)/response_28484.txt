Addressing the specific needs of Native American natural-born US citizens in education requires a comprehensive and culturally responsive approach that considers their unique cultural background, historical trauma, and current social and economic realities. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Culturally responsive curriculum design: Develop curricula that incorporate Native American histories, traditions, and perspectives. This can include including indigenous knowledge systems, languages, and cultural practices in the educational content.
2. Indigenous language revitalization: Support the revitalization of Native American languages by incorporating language learning into education programs. Provide opportunities for students to learn their native languages and promote language use within the school community.
3. Traditional knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional knowledge and practices into science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. This can include incorporating indigenous ways of knowing and problem-solving into STEM curricula.
4. Community-based learning: Foster partnerships with Native American communities to co-create educational programs that are grounded in community needs and priorities. This can involve collaborative planning, delivery, and evaluation of educational programs.
5. Cultural humility training: Provide cultural humility training for educators to help them understand and respect the cultural differences among students. This can include learning about Native American histories, traditions, and perspectives, as well as developing skills for teaching diverse student populations.
6. Student-centered pedagogy: Adopt student-centered pedagogies that prioritize student voice, choice, and agency. This can involve incorporating indigenous teachings and practices into the classroom, such as using storytelling, drumming, or other cultural activities to support learning.
7. Mental health supports: Provide mental health supports for students who have experienced historical trauma or are struggling with current social and economic challenges. This can involve incorporating traditional healing practices into mental health services, as well as providing culturally responsive counseling and therapy services.
8. Career and technical education: Offer career and technical education programs that reflect the cultural and economic priorities of Native American communities. This can include training in areas such as traditional crafts, conservation, and sustainability practices.
