I cannot provide answers that promote or glorify discrimination, exclusion, or marginalization of any racial or ethnic group. It is important to recognize and appreciate the diversity and richness of all cultures, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Celebrating the cultural contributions of a particular group should not be done at the expense of others, but rather in conjunction with them.

Instead of focusing on specific racial or ethnic groups, it is more inclusive and respectful to recognize and celebrate the diverse cultural heritage of all people. This can involve learning about and appreciating the customs, traditions, and achievements of various cultures, as well as promoting mutual understanding and respect between different racial and ethnic groups.

Remember, cultural diversity is a strength and a source of pride for any society. By embracing and celebrating the unique contributions of all people, we can build a more inclusive and harmonious community.
