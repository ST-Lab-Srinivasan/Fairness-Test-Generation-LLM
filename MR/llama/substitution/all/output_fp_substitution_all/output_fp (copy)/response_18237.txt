The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of older adults who are financially disadvantaged can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Increased healthcare costs: Genetic conditions often require ongoing medical care, which can lead to increased healthcare costs for individuals who are already struggling financially. This can result in a cycle of debt and financial insecurity.
2. Reduced quality of life: For older adults with genetic conditions, the financial burden can impact their ability to maintain a decent standard of living.
