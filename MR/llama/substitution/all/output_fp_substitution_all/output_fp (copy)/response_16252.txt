Introduction:
Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who identify as traditionalists. In many societies, military service is seen as a rite of passage and a way to prove one's masculinity. However, for individuals who are just starting to learn Arabic, the challenges of military service can be even more daunting. This paper will explore the impacts of military status on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker traditionalists and how it affects their language learning journey.

Impact on Language Learning:
One of the most significant challenges faced by beginner Arabic speaker traditionalists is the lack of time and resources to devote to language learning. Military service often requires long hours of training, deployment, and other activities that can make it difficult to find time to study and practice Arabic. Many traditionalists may also feel pressure to prioritize their military duties over their language learning, which can slow down their progress.

Another challenge is the limited availability of resources for language learners in a military context. Military bases often have limited access to qualified Arabic teachers, language learning materials, and practice opportunities. This can make it difficult for traditionalists to find the support they need to improve their language skills.

Impact on Cultural Adaptation:
Military service can also impact the cultural adaptation of beginner Arabic speaker traditionalists. Military training often involves intense physical and mental preparation, which can be challenging for individuals who are not familiar with the culture and customs of the countries where they are deployed. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disorientation, which can make it more difficult to learn and adapt to a new language.

Furthermore, traditionalists may face discrimination or prejudice based on their military status, which can impact their ability to communicate effectively in Arabic. They may feel embarrassed or uncomfortable about their military background, leading them to avoid speaking Arabic altogether.

Impact on Identity:
Military service can also affect the identity of beginner Arabic speaker traditionalists. Military training often emphasizes discipline and obedience, which can clash with the individualistic values of many language learners. This can lead to feelings of confusion or discomfort, which can impact their ability to learn and retain Arabic.
