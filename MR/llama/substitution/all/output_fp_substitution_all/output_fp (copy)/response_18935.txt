Addressing the needs of non-independently living individuals, including those who are not newly widowed, in disaster response requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Needs Assessment: Conduct a needs assessment that takes into account the specific requirements of non-independently living individuals, including those who may have mobility or accessibility challenges. This can involve engaging with local organizations and communities to gather information on their needs.
2. Accessibility and Inclusivity: Ensure that disaster response efforts are accessible and inclusive for all individuals, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Age-Friendly Approach: Design disaster response efforts that cater to the unique needs of older adults, including those who may be socially isolated or have limited mobility. This can involve providing age-appropriate information and support, as well as leveraging intergenerational connections to build resilience.
4. Capacity Building: Develop training programs that equip non-independently living individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to respond to disasters. This can include emergency preparedness, first aid, and communication skills.
5. Networking and Collaboration: Foster partnerships between disaster response organizations and local groups that support non-independently living individuals. This can help ensure that these individuals receive the support they need during a disaster.
6. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity in disaster response efforts. This can involve pushing for changes to building codes, emergency preparedness plans, and response protocols to better accommodate non-independently living individuals.
7. Technology and Innovation: Leverage technology and innovation to improve accessibility and inclusivity in disaster response efforts. For example, using virtual reality to provide accessible emergency training or developing mobile apps that cater to the unique needs of non-independently living individuals.
8. Volunteer Management: Ensure that volunteers are trained to support non-independently living individuals during disaster response efforts. This can involve providing specialized training
