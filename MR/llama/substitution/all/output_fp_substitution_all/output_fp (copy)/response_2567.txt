Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-independent individuals, such as those who are not recently married or independent, can be achieved through a few key steps:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the group: Conduct research or gather feedback from non-independent individuals to understand their preferences and needs when it comes to cultural celebrations. This will help you tailor the celebration to meet their unique requirements.
2. Be mindful of accessibility: Make sure that the celebration is accessible to all, regardless of their abilities. This can include providing wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and other accommodations as needed.
3. Offer a variety of activities: Include a range of activities that cater to different interests and preferences. For example, you could offer cultural workshops, games, or social events that are inclusive and fun for all participants.
4. Foster a sense of community: Encourage participation and belonging by creating opportunities for people to connect with one another. This can be done through icebreaker activities, group discussions, or other interactive events.
5. Be respectful of cultural differences: Be sensitive to the diverse backgrounds and beliefs of the participants. Avoid cultural appropriation and ensure that the celebration is a celebration of all cultures, rather than just one.
6. Provide opportunities for solo participation: For those who may not have a significant other or be interested in group activities, provide opportunities for solo participation. This could include individual art-making stations, reading areas, or other quiet spaces where people can relax and enjoy the celebration on their own terms.
7. Be mindful of language barriers: If there are participants who speak different languages, consider providing translation services or visual aids to help facilitate communication.
8. Involve the community: Engage with local communities and organizations to co-create the cultural celebration. This will help ensure that the event is inclusive and representative of the diverse populations it serves.
9. Offer gender-neutral and family-friendly options: Provide gender-neutral and family-friendly options for participants, such as gender-neutral bathrooms or family-friendly activities.
10. Be flexible: Be prepared to adapt the celebration as needed based on participant feedback and needs
