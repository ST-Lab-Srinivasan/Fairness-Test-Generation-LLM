Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, including their political beliefs and behaviors. While previous research has primarily focused on the effects of marital status on conservative individuals, little is known about the impact of marital status on long-time single hardcore democrats. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the experiences and attitudes of long-time single hardcore democrats towards their marital status and how it affects their political beliefs and behaviors.

Methods:
A mixed-methods approach will be used for this study, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of long-time single hardcore democrats, collecting data on their marital status, political beliefs, and behaviors. Additionally, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subsample of participants to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and attitudes towards their marital status and its impact on their political beliefs and behaviors.

Results:
Preliminary results from the survey questionnaire indicate that long-time single hardcore democrats are more likely to hold progressive political views compared to married individuals. They also report higher levels of political engagement, including voting and activism. However, qualitative findings suggest that long-time single hardcore democrats may face unique challenges in terms of social isolation and stigma, which can impact their political beliefs and behaviors.

Conclusion:
While marital status does not seem to have a significant impact on the political beliefs and behaviors of long-time single hardcore democrats, it is clear that they face unique challenges that can affect their political experiences. Future research should continue to explore these issues and how they may shape the political attitudes and actions of this group. Additionally, policy interventions aimed at addressing social isolation and stigma among long-time single hardcore democrats may be necessary to fully understand and support their political experiences.
