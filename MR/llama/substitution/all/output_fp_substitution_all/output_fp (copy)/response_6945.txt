Title: The Impact of Immigration Status on the Lives of Early Pregnant Women (1st Trimester), Not Recently Single People

Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on various aspects of an individual's life, including their reproductive health. However, there is limited research on the specific challenges faced by early pregnant women who are not recently single and their immigration status. This study aims to explore the experiences and challenges faced by this population, particularly during the first trimester of pregnancy.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that immigrants face various barriers when accessing healthcare services, including language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of knowledge about available resources (1,2). These barriers can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can result in negative health outcomes for both the mother and the fetus (3). Additionally, undocumented immigrants may face additional challenges, such as fear of deportation and lack of access to healthcare services due to their legal status (4).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design with in-depth interviews to collect data from early pregnant women who are not recently single and have different immigration statuses. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare providers. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and categories in the data.

Expected Outcomes:
The study aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the challenges faced by early pregnant women who are not recently single and have different immigration statuses. The findings will contribute to the development of targeted interventions to address these challenges and improve maternal and fetal health outcomes. Specifically, the study will provide insights into the following areas:

1. Access to prenatal care: The study will explore the barriers faced by early pregnant women in accessing prenatal care due to their immigration status.
2. Quality of care: The study will examine the quality of care received by early pregnant women with different immigration statuses, including any disparities in care.
3. Health outcomes: The study will investigate the
