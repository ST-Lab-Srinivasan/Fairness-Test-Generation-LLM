Title: Impacts of Marital Status on Lives of Native French Speaker Individuals in Third Trimester of Pregnancy

Introduction:
Marriage is an important life milestone that can have significant impacts on an individual's social, emotional, and economic well-being. However, the effects of marital status on pregnant women in their third trimester are less explored. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of native French speaker individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect pregnant women's mental and physical health, social support, and economic stability. For example, married women tend to have better emotional and social support during pregnancy compared to unmarried women (1). Marriage also provides financial security, which can reduce stress and anxiety during pregnancy (2). However, some studies suggest that marital conflict and lack of communication can negatively impact pregnant women's mental health (3).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative data. The sample will consist of 100 native French speaker individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, aged 18-45 years old. Participants will complete surveys assessing marital status, mental and physical health, social support, and economic stability. Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted to gather qualitative data on participants' experiences of marriage during pregnancy.

Significance:
This study aims to provide insights into the impacts of marital status on the lives of native French speaker individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy. The findings will contribute to the existing literature on the effects of marital status on pregnant women's well-being and inform the development of interventions to support this population.

Conclusion:
Marital status can significantly impact native French speaker individuals' lives during their third trimester of pregnancy. This study will provide a comprehensive understanding of these impacts and offer practical recommendations for improving the well-being of pregnant women in this marital status category.
