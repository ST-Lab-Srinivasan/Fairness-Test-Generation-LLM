Promoting financial stability during the third trimester of pregnancy can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a budget: Develop a budget that accounts for the additional expenses that come with pregnancy, such as prenatal care, maternity clothing, and baby supplies. Make sure to include a line item for savings or emergency funds.
2. Build an emergency fund: Aim to save at least three to six months' worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account. This will provide a cushion in case of unexpected medical bills, job loss, or other financial emergencies.

4. Plan for baby-related expenses: Create a list of all the expenses you'll face after the baby is born, such as diapers, formula, and childcare costs. Start saving for these expenses early on to avoid financial stress.
5. Take advantage of tax breaks: Utilize tax-advantaged savings vehicles like 401(k) or Roth IRAs to save for retirement while reducing your taxable income. You can also consider using a health savings account (HSA) if you have a high-deductible health plan.
6. Stay informed and engaged: Attend prenatal classes and consult with your healthcare provider to stay up-to-date on pregnancy-related expenses. Stay engaged with your partner's financial planning efforts to ensure that you're both on the same page.
