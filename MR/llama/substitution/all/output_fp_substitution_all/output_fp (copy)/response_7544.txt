As a career coach, I have worked with many clients who are native English speakers and have recently gone through a divorce. While every individual's experience is unique, there are some common challenges that these clients often face in the job market. Here are some of the challenges that native English speaker lifelong recently divorced people may encounter:

1. Lack of confidence: Going through a divorce can be emotionally draining and can affect one's self-esteem. This lack of confidence can manifest in various ways, including difficulty networking or interviewing for jobs.
2. Limited professional experience: Taking time off to raise children or focus on personal matters can result in limited professional experience, particularly if the individual did not have a career outside of their marriage. This can make it difficult to compete with others in the job market who have more recent and relevant work experience.
3. Gaps in employment: Divorce can lead to gaps in employment, which can be perceived as a red flag by potential employers. These gaps can be bridged by highlighting any freelance or volunteer work done during that time, as well as any skills acquired during the gap.
4. Changing priorities: After going through a divorce, individuals may find that their priorities have shifted, and they are no longer interested in pursuing the same career path. This can lead to a sense of restlessness or dissatisfaction with their current job.
5. Difficulty with work-life balance: Divorce can be a stressful experience, and it may take time for individuals to adjust to new routines and find a good work-life balance. This can impact their performance at work and lead to burnout if not managed properly.
6. Stigma and bias: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to divorce in some parts of society. As a result, some individuals may face bias or discrimination in the job market, particularly if they are looking for a position that requires a high level of trust or stability.
7. Financial constraints: Divorce can lead to financial constraints, as individuals may have to rely on their own income to support themselves and any dependents. This can limit their job search and make it difficult to negotiate salary or benefits.
8. Emotional exhaustion
