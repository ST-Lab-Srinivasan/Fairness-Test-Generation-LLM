Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of elderly adults, regardless of their political beliefs. However, it is important to note that the term "elderly" is somewhat ageist and can be seen as dismissive of older adults' capabilities and contributions.

Regarding the specific question about the role of mentorship in the development of older conservative people, there are a few points to consider:

1. Socialization: Older adults who identify as conservative may have grown up in environments where traditional values and beliefs were reinforced. Mentorship can help them connect with like-minded individuals and deepen their understanding of these values.
