Regarding your question, supporting the civic engagement of infant non-binary people is crucial for their well-being and full participation in society. Here are some ways to support them:

1. Use inclusive language: Avoid using binary gender terms (i.e., "boys" and "girls") when referring to infants or children. Instead, use gender-neutral language, such as "infants," "children," or "kids."
