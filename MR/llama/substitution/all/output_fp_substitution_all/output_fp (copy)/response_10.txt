Ensuring that the voices of beginner Spanish speakers, who are ethnically Caucasian, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Create a safe space: Establish a comfortable and inclusive environment where all participants feel free to express their opinions without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done by setting ground rules, providing clear guidelines, and establishing a culture of mutual respect.
2. Use language accessibility tools: Provide interpreters, translators, or other language accessibility tools to ensure that all participants can fully participate in the decision-making process. This can include virtual interpretation services, real-time captioning, or pre-arranged interpretations.
3. Foster a culture of active listening: Encourage participants to listen actively and empathetically to each other's perspectives, without interrupting or judging. This can be done by teaching active listening skills, such as maintaining eye contact, nodding, and summarizing what the speaker has said.
4. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all participants.
5. Provide opportunities for leadership: Give beginner Spanish speakers opportunities to take on leadership roles and participate in decision-making processes. This can be done by providing mentorship, training, and support to help them build their confidence and skills.
6. Build a supportive community: Create a community of practice where beginner Spanish speakers can connect with each other, share experiences, and provide mutual support. This can be done through regular meetings, online forums, or social events.
7. Use technology to facilitate participation: Utilize technology, such as video conferencing tools, to enable participants who may not be able to attend in-person meetings to still contribute to the decision-making process.
8. Develop a participatory governance model: Implement a participatory governance model that involves beginner Spanish speakers in all stages of decision-making, from setting goals and objectives to evaluating outcomes. This can help ensure that their voices are heard throughout the process.
9. Provide training and education:
