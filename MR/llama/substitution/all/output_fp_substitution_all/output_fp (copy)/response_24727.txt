Creating more inclusive educational curriculums for 90s+ early pregnancy students requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach that acknowledges the unique needs and challenges of this age group. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Flexible Learning Environments: Offer flexible learning environments that cater to the physical limitations of older students. This may include providing comfortable seating, adequate lighting, and easy-to-use technology.
2. Accommodations for Cognitive Decline: Recognize the cognitive decline that comes with aging and provide accommodations such as extra time to complete assignments or the option to use a calculator during exams.
3. Age-Related Issues: Address age-related issues such as menopause, osteoporosis, and arthritis by providing education on how these conditions can impact academic performance and offering support services such as counseling and physical therapy.
4. Intergenerational Learning: Encourage intergenerational learning by pairing older students with younger peers. This can help to create a sense of community and mutual respect, while also providing opportunities for older students to share their life experiences and wisdom.
5. Technology Integration: Leverage technology to enhance the learning experience for older students. Consider using audio or visual aids, e-books, and other digital resources that can help to mitigate age-related declines in cognitive functioning.
6. Personalized Learning Plans: Develop personalized learning plans that take into account each student's unique strengths, challenges, and goals. This may involve tailoring the curriculum to meet the individual needs of older students, as well as providing additional support and resources to help them succeed.
7. Community Outreach: Engage with the local community to raise awareness about the needs of older students and to provide opportunities for intergenerational learning and mentorship. This can involve partnering with local organizations, hosting events, or creating age-appropriate educational resources.
8. Inclusive Assessments: Develop inclusive assessments that take into account the unique challenges faced by older students. This may involve providing additional support during exams or using alternative assessment methods such as portfolios or presentations.
