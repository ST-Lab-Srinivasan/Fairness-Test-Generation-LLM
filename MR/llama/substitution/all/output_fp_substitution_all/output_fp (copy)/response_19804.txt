Promoting the educational success of Native American students, including those who are extreme and ultra-independent, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some strategies that educators and policymakers can consider:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers to understand and respect the cultural backgrounds of Native American students, including their values, beliefs, and practices. This can involve incorporating traditional teachings and practices into the classroom, as well as creating a safe and inclusive learning environment.
2. Personalized learning plans: Work with each student to develop a personalized learning plan that takes into account their individual strengths, weaknesses, and learning style. This can help ensure that they are engaged and motivated in their academic work.
3. Mentorship and support: Provide students with mentors and supportive adults who can offer guidance and encouragement. This can include traditional elders or cultural leaders, as well as educators who are trained to work with Native American students.
4. Community-based learning: Involve the community in the educational process by incorporating traditional practices and knowledge into the classroom. This can help students see the relevance of their education to their lives and communities.
5. Language and cultural revitalization: Support the revitalization of Native American languages and cultures by providing language classes, cultural immersion programs, and other opportunities for students to learn about and engage with their heritage.
6. Academic and career counseling: Provide students with individualized academic and career counseling to help them identify their strengths and interests, and explore post-secondary education and career options.
7. Summer programs and internships: Offer summer programs and internships that provide students with hands-on learning experiences and expose them to various career paths.
8. Family engagement: Engage families in the educational process by providing opportunities for them to learn alongside their children, participate in school events, and offer support and encouragement.
9. Professional development: Provide educators with ongoing professional development opportunities that help them understand the unique needs of Native American students and how to best support them.
10. Collaboration with tribal communities: Work closely with tribal communities to ensure that educational programs are culturally responsive and aligned with community
