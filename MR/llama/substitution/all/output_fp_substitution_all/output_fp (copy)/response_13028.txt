Mexican agnostic people may face a number of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of recognition: Agnosticism is not recognized as an official religion in Mexico, which means that agnostics may not have the same legal protections and benefits as religious minorities.
2. Limited freedom of religion: While the Mexican Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, it also establishes Catholicism as the "prevailing religion" in the country. This can limit the freedom of agnostics to practice their beliefs without interference from the state.
3. Discrimination: Agnostics may face discrimination and prejudice from religious groups and individuals who view them as non-believers or unorthodox. This can lead to social exclusion and marginalization, which can be particularly challenging in a society with a strong Catholic tradition.

6. Limited employment opportunities: Agnostics may face limited job opportunities in fields that are heavily influenced by religion, such as religious education or religious healthcare.
