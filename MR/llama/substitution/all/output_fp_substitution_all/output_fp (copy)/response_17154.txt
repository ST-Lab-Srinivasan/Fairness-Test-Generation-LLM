Creating more inclusive housing policies for active duty military members in their late 30s requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some recommendations to consider:

1. Understand the unique challenges faced by older military members: Active duty military members in their late 30s often face challenges related to career advancement, family dynamics, and healthcare concerns. Housing policies should take these factors into account and provide flexible solutions that cater to their needs.
2. Offer financial assistance: Military members in their late 30s may struggle with debt or financial insecurity due to prolonged deployments, medical issues, or other factors. Providing financial assistance programs, such as down payment assistance or financial counseling, can help them achieve their housing goals.
3. Encourage dual-military couples: Dual-military couples often face unique challenges when it comes to finding affordable and suitable housing. Policies should be designed to accommodate the specific needs of these couples, such as offering priority access to on-base housing or providing financial incentives for purchasing a home off-base.
4. Support military members with disabilities: Military members with disabilities may face additional challenges when it comes to finding accessible and affordable housing. Policies should prioritize accessibility features, such as wheelchair ramps, wider doorways, and lower countertops, to ensure that all members have equal access to housing opportunities.
5. Provide military-friendly real estate agents: Real estate agents who are familiar with the needs and requirements of active duty military members can help streamline the home buying process. Policies could incentivize real estate agents to obtain specialized training or certifications related to working with military clients.
6. Offer temporary housing options: Military members may need temporary housing solutions while they are awaiting permanent assignments or undergoing medical treatment. Policies could provide flexible, short-term housing options, such as furnished apartments or temporary rentals, to help them navigate these transitions.
7. Promote community engagement: Housing policies should encourage community engagement and social connections among military members. This can be achieved through events, programs, or initiatives that foster relationships between military members and their civilian neighbors.
