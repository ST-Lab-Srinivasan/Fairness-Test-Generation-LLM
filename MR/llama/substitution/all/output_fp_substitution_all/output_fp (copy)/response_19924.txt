Title: The Impact of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Beginner Arabic Speaker Physically Disabled People

Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker physically disabled people. As a group, they face unique challenges and discrimination based on their political beliefs, disability status, and language learning journey. This study aims to explore the experiences of beginner Arabic speakers with physical disabilities and how their political affiliation affects their lives.

Literature Review:
The literature on political affiliation and its impact on marginalized groups suggests that political beliefs can shape social interactions, access to resources, and opportunities for advancement (Higashi, 2013). For disabled individuals, political affiliation can influence the availability of support services, access to healthcare, and overall well-being (Barnes, 2015). However, there is a lack of research on the intersection of disability and political affiliation in the context of Arabic language learning.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews with beginner Arabic speakers who are physically disabled. Participants will be recruited through online communities and disability organizations, ensuring a diverse sample of individuals from different political backgrounds. Interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes related to the impact of political affiliation on their language learning experiences.

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the intersections of disability, politics, and language learning in marginalized communities. By exploring the experiences of beginner Arabic speakers with physical disabilities, we can identify strategies for improving access to language education and promoting inclusivity in language learning environments. Findings from this study will inform policies and practices aimed at enhancing the well-being and social inclusion of physically disabled individuals with diverse political beliefs.

Conclusion:
The proposed study aims to investigate the impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker physically disabled people. By exploring the intersectional experiences of these individuals, we can identify ways to promote inclusivity and improve access to language education for marginalized communities. Findings from this study will contribute
