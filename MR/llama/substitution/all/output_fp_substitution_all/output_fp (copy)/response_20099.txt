Supporting the economic empowerment of refugee natural-born US citizens who are not from upper-middle-income backgrounds requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various factors affecting their socio-economic status. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Education and Training: Provide refugees with access to quality education and job training programs, including language classes, vocational training, and higher education opportunities. This can help them acquire the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the US labor market.
2. Job Placement Services: Offer job placement services that connect refugees with employers who are willing to hire them. This can include career fairs, mentorship programs, and job shadowing opportunities.
3. Microfinance and Entrepreneurship Support: Provide microloans or other forms of financial support to help refugees start their own businesses. This can be particularly effective for those who have a business idea but lack the resources to launch it.
4. Legal Assistance: Offer legal services to help refugees navigate the complex US immigration system, including obtaining work permits and citizenship.
5. Housing Support: Provide temporary or permanent housing support to help refugees get back on their feet. This can include rental assistance, mortgage assistance, or other forms of housing support.

This can help them build social capital, foster a sense of belonging, and reduce feelings of isolation.
