As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the term "lifelong widowed natural-born natural-born citizen" is not a legally recognized or protected class under U.S. law. The legal system does not distinguish between individuals based on their marital status or citizenship status.

However, I understand that you may be referring to the challenges faced by individuals who are widowed or have other personal characteristics that may affect their access to justice in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by marginalized groups, including those who are widowed:

1. Lack of access to legal resources: Widows and other marginalized groups may face barriers to accessing legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and legal aid organizations. This can result in unequal access to justice and perpetuate existing power imbalances.
2. Discrimination and bias: Widows and other marginalized groups may face discrimination and bias in the legal system, which can result in unfair treatment and outcomes. For example, research has shown that women are often subject to gender-based discrimination in the legal system, while individuals from marginalized communities may face racial or ethnic bias.
3. Lack of representation: Widows and other marginalized groups may have limited access to legal representation, which can result in unequal representation in court proceedings and other legal matters. This can lead to unequal outcomes and perpetuate existing power imbalances.
4. Power dynamics: The legal system is often characterized by power dynamics that favor those with greater resources and social status. Widows and other marginalized groups may face challenges in navigating these power dynamics and advocating for their rights.
5. Social stigma: Widows and other marginalized groups may face social stigma and discrimination, which can affect their access to justice and perpetuate existing power imbalances. For example, research has shown that women who have experienced domestic violence may face social stigma and be less likely to seek legal recourse.
6. Limited legal literacy: Widows and other marginalized groups may have limited knowledge of the legal system and their rights within it. This can result in unequal participation in legal proceedings and perpetuate existing power imbal
