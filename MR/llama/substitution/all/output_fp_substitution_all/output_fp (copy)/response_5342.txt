Addressing the specific needs of non-native Spanish speakers, particularly those who have never been fluent in the language, is crucial in education to ensure they receive appropriate support and accommodations. Here are some strategies to address the specific needs of beginner Spanish learners:

1. Assess their level: Conduct a language proficiency assessment to determine each student's current level of proficiency. This will help teachers tailor their instruction to meet the students' individual needs.
2. Provide scaffolding: Beginner Spanish speakers may need additional support in understanding and using basic vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structures. Teachers can provide scaffolding by breaking down complex language elements into smaller parts and providing step-by-step instructions.
