Creating more inclusive community events for recently expecting gender-nonconforming people requires thoughtful planning, consideration, and sensitivity. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more welcoming:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "mother" or "father") and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of families, such as "parent," "caregiver," or "guardian."
2. Accessibility: Ensure that your event is accessible to people of all abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Gender-Neutral Facilities: Make sure that the facilities at your event are gender-neutral and inclusive of all participants. Provide gender-neutral restrooms or consider using gender-free language when referring to restroom facilities.
4. Education and Training: Offer education and training to your staff, volunteers, and participants on how to create a welcoming environment for gender-nonconforming individuals. This can include information on the importance of inclusive language, cultural sensitivity, and respect for people's privacy and personal space.
5. Involve Gender-Nonconforming Communities: Engage with local gender-nonconforming communities and organizations to get feedback on how to make your event more inclusive. This can help ensure that your event is tailored to the specific needs and preferences of this community.
6. Promote Inclusivity: Promote your event's inclusivity through social media, flyers, and other marketing materials. Use language that emphasizes the welcoming nature of your event and encourages participation from all genders.
7. Flexibility: Be flexible and accommodating when it comes to participants' needs. Offer options for participant identification (e.g., gender-neutral pronouns, non-binary identification) and ensure that your event is inclusive of all genders.
8. Community Building: Create opportunities for gender-nonconforming individuals to connect with one another and build a sense of community. This can include hosting social events or creating online spaces for people to share their experiences and
