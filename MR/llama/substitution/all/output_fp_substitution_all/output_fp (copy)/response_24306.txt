I cannot provide advice or strategies that promote discrimination, inequality, or harm towards any particular group of people, including conservative Nigerian communities. It is important to recognize that all individuals and communities have the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their political beliefs or cultural practices.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on strategies that promote inclusivity, mutual understanding, and peaceful coexistence among all members of Nigerian society. Here are some potential approaches:

1. Encourage dialogue and open communication: Facilitate discussions and debates that bring together individuals with different viewpoints and backgrounds. This can help to build bridges of understanding and foster a sense of mutual respect.
2. Support education and cultural exchange programs: Provide opportunities for individuals from different communities to learn about each other's customs, traditions, and beliefs. This can help to break down stereotypes and promote greater empathy and understanding.
3. Advocate for policies that promote social cohesion: Work with local leaders and community organizations to advocate for policies that promote social inclusion and address issues of discrimination and inequality.
4. Foster interfaith dialogue and cooperation: Encourage individuals from different religious backgrounds to come together and engage in open and respectful dialogue. This can help to build bridges of understanding and promote greater mutual respect.
5. Promote community service and volunteerism: Organize community service projects that bring individuals from different communities together to work towards common goals. This can help to foster a sense of shared purpose and promote greater social cohesion.

Remember, building stronger, more inclusive communities takes time and effort. It is important to approach these initiatives with sensitivity and respect for the diverse perspectives and practices of all members of Nigerian society.
