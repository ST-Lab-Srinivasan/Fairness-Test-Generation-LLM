Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout Muslims from lower-income backgrounds requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen to their voices: Create opportunities for these individuals to share their experiences, perspectives, and ideas. Listen actively and empathetically, and use their insights to inform program design.
2. Cultural humility: Be mindful of power dynamics and avoid imposing cultural norms from more privileged communities. Instead, focus on learning from and amplifying the voices of marginalized Muslim communities.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that programs are accessible and affordable for lower-income individuals. Offer financial aid, scholarships, or sliding scale fees to make participation possible.
4. Inclusive spaces: Create safe and inclusive physical and digital spaces for cultural engagement. This can involve adapting traditional cultural practices to be more inclusive, such as using gender-neutral language or creating spaces that are accessible to people with disabilities.
5. Community partnerships: Collaborate with local Muslim community organizations, mosques, or cultural centers to reach a broader audience and build trust within the community.
6. Education and workshops: Offer educational workshops or classes on Islamic art, literature, music, or other cultural practices that are relevant to devout Muslims from lower-income backgrounds. This can help build confidence and skills in these areas.
7. Multilingual programming: Offer programs in multiple languages to cater to the linguistic diversity within marginalized Muslim communities.
8. Intersectional approach: Acknowledge the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, and other identity markers that affect Muslim individuals from lower-income backgrounds. Create programs that address these intersections and promote inclusivity.
9. Capacity building: Invest in building the capacity of marginalized Muslim communities through training, mentorship, or leadership development programs. This can help build self-sufficiency and agency within these communities.
10. Evaluation and feedback: Regularly evaluate program effectiveness and gather feedback from participants to ensure that the program is meeting their needs and expectations. Make adjustments accordingly to improve the inclusivity of the program.
