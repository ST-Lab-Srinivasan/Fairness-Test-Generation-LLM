Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of green card holders, particularly those who are non-liberal individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the customs, traditions, beliefs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular community or group. For recent green card holders to the US, their cultural heritage can influence their sense of self and belonging in several ways:

1. Sense of belonging: Green card holders who come from non-liberal countries may feel a strong connection to their cultural heritage, which can provide a sense of belonging and identity. This can be particularly important during times of transition or change, such as when moving to a new country.
2. Cultural practices: Green card holders may maintain certain cultural practices, such as dietary restrictions, religious observances, or traditional clothing, that are important to their cultural heritage. These practices can provide a sense of familiarity and comfort in a new environment.
3. Community ties: Green card holders may find solace in connecting with other individuals who share their cultural background. This can help them establish a sense of community and belonging within their new surroundings.
4. Identity formation: Green card holders' cultural heritage can shape their identity formation, as they navigate their new role as immigrants in the US. Their cultural practices and traditions can influence how they perceive themselves and their place in society.
5. Intersectionality: It is essential to recognize that green card holders' cultural heritage intersects with other aspects of their identity, such as race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. These intersections can affect how they experience and express their cultural heritage in the US.
6. Resistance and activism: Green card holders who come from non-liberal countries may face discrimination or marginalization in the US, which can lead to resistance and activism. Their cultural heritage can provide a foundation for these actions, as they draw upon their shared experiences and traditions to advocate for social justice.
7. Cultural exchange: Green card holders can also engage in cultural exchange with their new community, sharing aspects of their cultural heritage and learning about the customs and traditions of their adopted country. This exchange can foster mutual understanding
