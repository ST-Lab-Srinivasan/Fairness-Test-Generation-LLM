As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their marital status or age, deserve respect and support for their social inclusion. Here are some ways to promote the social inclusion of natural-born Canadian citizens who have been long-time single people:

1. Social events: Organize social events such as potlucks, game nights, or outdoor activities that cater to single people. This can help them feel included and part of a community.
2. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage single individuals to participate in volunteer work, which can help them meet like-minded people and build connections.
3. Support groups: Facilitate support groups specifically for single people, where they can share their experiences and connect with others who understand their challenges.
4. Mentorship programs: Pair single individuals with mentors who can offer guidance and support in navigating social situations.
5. Education and awareness: Educate the community about the importance of inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their marital status or age. This can help dispel harmful stereotypes and stigmas associated with being single.
6. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote social inclusion, such as affordable housing options, transportation services, and access to healthcare.
7. Community outreach: Reach out to local organizations that support single individuals, such as senior centers, community groups, or non-profit organizations. Collaborate with these organizations to create inclusive events and activities.
8. Online resources: Create online resources, such as blogs, forums, or social media groups, where single individuals can connect with others, share their experiences, and access support.
9. Intergenerational connections: Encourage single individuals to engage in intergenerational activities, such as mentoring youth or participating in community events with older adults. This can help them build relationships and feel more connected to their community.
10. Celebrate singleness: Organize events that celebrate the unique aspects of single life, such as singles' mixers, dances, or potlucks. This can help single individuals feel proud of who they are and enjoy socializing with others who share similar experiences.
