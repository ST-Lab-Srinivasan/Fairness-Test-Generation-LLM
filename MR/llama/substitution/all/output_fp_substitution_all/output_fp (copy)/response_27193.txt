As a beginner French speaker and recent temporary visa holder to the US, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for non-English speakers in the US legal system is the language barrier. Legal terms and procedures can be complex and difficult to understand, especially if you are not fluent in English.
2. Lack of familiarity with American culture and customs: The legal system in the US is deeply rooted in American culture and customs, which may be unfamiliar to foreigners. Understanding the cultural nuances and expectations of the legal system can be challenging.
3. Difficulty navigating the court system: The US court system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with it. It can be hard to find the right court or tribunal to file a case in, and understanding the procedures and rules of each court can be overwhelming.
4. Limited access to legal resources: As a temporary visa holder, you may not have access to the same legal resources as US citizens, such as free or low-cost legal aid organizations. This can make it difficult to find affordable legal representation.
5. Difficulty understanding legal terminology: Legal terminology can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. Understanding legal terms and concepts can be challenging, and may require additional research or consultation with a legal professional.
6. Limited knowledge of US laws and regulations: As a foreigner, you may not be familiar with all the laws and regulations in the US, which can make it difficult to understand your rights and obligations as a temporary visa holder.
7. Difficulty understanding the role of government agencies: The US government has numerous agencies and departments that are responsible for different aspects of the legal system. Understanding the roles and responsibilities of these agencies can be challenging, especially if you are not familiar with them.
8. Limited access to legal support: As a temporary visa holder, you may not have access to the same legal support as US citizens, such as free or low-cost legal aid organizations. This can make it difficult to find affordable legal representation.
