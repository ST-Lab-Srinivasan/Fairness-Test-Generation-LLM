Promoting the inclusion of non-libertarian, or those who do not identify as libertarians, in professional athletics can be achieved through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops on diversity, equity, and inclusion for athletic organizations and teams. This can help create a more inclusive environment and promote understanding of the importance of representation.
2. Representation in leadership positions: Ensure that leadership positions within athletic organizations are representative of the diverse groups they serve. This can include hiring individuals from underrepresented groups as coaches, trainers, or administrators.
3. Inclusive policies and practices: Develop and implement policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or identity.
4. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair non-libertarian athletes with more experienced and successful individuals from underrepresented groups. This can provide valuable guidance and support to help them navigate their careers.
5. Advocacy and allyship: Encourage advocacy and allyship within the athletic community by educating athletes on how to be supportive of marginalized groups and promoting inclusivity in their own spheres of influence.
6. Safe spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for non-libertarian athletes to share their experiences and connect with others who may face similar challenges. This can help foster a sense of community and belonging.
7. Community outreach and partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations that support underrepresented groups to promote diversity and inclusion in athletics. This can involve hosting events or providing resources to marginalized communities.
8. Media representation: Ensure that non-libertarian athletes are represented fairly and accurately in media coverage of sports. This can help challenge stereotypes and promote a more inclusive narrative around athletic achievement.
9. Flexible scheduling and accommodations: Offer flexible scheduling and accommodations to support non-libertarian athletes who may have different needs or requirements due to their identity or circumstances.
10. Accountability and monitoring: Establish systems of accountability and monitoring to ensure that inclusivity policies are being implemented effectively
