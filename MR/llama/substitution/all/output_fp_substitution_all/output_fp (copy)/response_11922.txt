Addressing the specific needs of native Chinese speakers and native English speakers in healthcare is crucial to ensure effective communication and quality care. Here are some strategies that healthcare providers can adopt:

1. Language Support: Provide language support services, such as interpreters or translated materials, for patients who do not speak the dominant language of the healthcare system. This can help bridge the language gap and ensure that patients receive accurate information and appropriate care.
