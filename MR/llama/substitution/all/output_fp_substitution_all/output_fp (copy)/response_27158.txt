I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including based on a person's immigration status or wealth. Every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances.

It is important to recognize that each person brings their unique perspective and experiences to the table, regardless of their immigration status or socioeconomic status. A recently naturalized citizen wealthy multimillionaire person may have a distinct perspective on issues related to their country of origin, as well as their new country of residence. They may also have valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities facing diverse communities and economies.

Rather than focusing on superficial characteristics such as wealth or immigration status, it is more productive to engage with individuals based on their ideas, values, and contributions to society. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and equitable environment that encourages diverse perspectives and promotes meaningful dialogue and collaboration.
