Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically full African-American non-independent individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the customs, traditions, beliefs, values, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular cultural or ethnic group. For African Americans, their cultural heritage is shaped by their history, experiences, and social context, which have been influenced by slavery, segregation, and systemic racism.

Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities of ethnically full African-American non-independent individuals:

1. Shared Experiences and Traditions: African Americans have a shared history of oppression, resistance, and resilience that has created a common culture and identity. This shared experience is reflected in their traditions, customs, and beliefs, which are passed down from generation to generation.
2. Cultural Expression: African American cultural expression is diverse and rich, encompassing music (e.g., blues, jazz, hip-hop), dance (e.g., jazz, stepping), art (e.g., quilting, painting), literature (e.g., poetry, fiction), and cuisine (e.g., soul food). These forms of cultural expression are an important part of African American identity and contribute to the group's distinctiveness.
3. Cultural Practices: Many African American cultural practices, such as Afro-centric spirituality, Kwanzaa, and Black History Month, provide opportunities for individuals to connect with their heritage and express their identity. These practices also serve as a means of preserving and transmitting cultural knowledge and values from one generation to the next.
4. Family and Community Ties: For many African Americans, family and community ties are an essential aspect of their identity. The close-knit nature of African American communities provides a sense of belonging and support, which is critical in the face of systemic racism and discrimination.
5. Intersectionality: African American identity is shaped by intersectional factors such as gender, class, sexuality, and disability. These intersections influence how individuals express their identities within larger cultural and social structures.
6. Resistance and Activism: African Americans have a long history of resistance
