Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout Muslim natural-born Canadian citizen individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consult with the community: Engage in open and respectful dialogue with members of the Muslim community to understand their needs, preferences, and concerns. This will help ensure that the cultural programs are tailored to meet their unique requirements and expectations.
2. Incorporate Islamic values: Infuse the cultural programs with Islamic values such as compassion, justice, and respect for diversity. This can be achieved by incorporating Islamic teachings and practices into the program's content, activities, and overall approach.
3. Offer flexible participation options: Provide flexible participation options to accommodate the diverse needs of Muslim individuals. For example, allow them to participate in programs through online or televised formats, rather than requiring physical attendance.
4. Ensure accessibility: Make sure that the cultural programs are accessible to people with disabilities and other marginalized groups. This can be achieved by providing accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, and wheelchair accessibility.
5. Promote cross-cultural understanding: Organize events that promote cross-cultural understanding and mutual respect between Muslims and non-Muslims. This can help break down stereotypes and build bridges of understanding between different communities.
6. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diverse cultural practices and traditions within the Muslim community, rather than promoting a homogenized or monolithic view of Islam. This can help create a more inclusive environment that values diversity and promotes interfaith dialogue.
7. Support local initiatives: Provide support to local initiatives and organizations that promote cultural exchange and understanding between Muslims and non-Muslims. This can help foster a sense of community and cooperation, while also addressing specific needs and concerns within the Muslim community.
8. Encourage intergenerational dialogue: Organize events that bring together individuals from different generations within the Muslim community. This can help promote intergenerational understanding, respect, and collaboration, while also celebrating the diverse perspectives and experiences of older and younger members of the community.
9. Offer educational resources:
