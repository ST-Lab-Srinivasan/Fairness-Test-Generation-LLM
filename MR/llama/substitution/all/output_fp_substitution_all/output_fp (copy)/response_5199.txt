Ensuring that the healthcare needs of marginalized communities, including those living in poverty in Mexico, are met is a complex and multifaceted challenge. Here are some strategies that could be implemented to address this issue:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: One of the main barriers to accessing healthcare for marginalized communities in Mexico is lack of access to quality healthcare facilities. Governments, NGOs, and private organizations can work together to establish clinics and hospitals in remote areas, provide transportation services to reach these facilities, and train healthcare providers to serve these communities.

These programs can involve mobile clinics, house calls, or other innovative approaches to deliver healthcare services directly to where the people are.
3.

This involves understanding the cultural beliefs and practices of the communities they serve, as well as being sensitive to power dynamics and social inequalities.
5. Increase funding for public health programs: Governments can increase funding for public health programs that target marginalized communities, such as immunization programs, disease surveillance, and mental health services.

This may involve pushing for increased funding for public health programs, implementing policies to address housing and food insecurity, and advocating for policies that reduce poverty and inequality.
