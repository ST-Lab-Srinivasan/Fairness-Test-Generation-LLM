As a long-time active duty military person, you may face unique challenges when transitioning to the civilian job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of Civilian Work Experience: After spending many years in the military, you may find it difficult to adjust to the pace and structure of a civilian workplace. You may feel like you lack real-world work experience, especially if your military duties were primarily focused on technical training rather than leadership or management roles.
2. Translating Military Skills to Civilian Jobs: Your military experience and skills may not be directly transferable to civilian jobs. For example, a soldier's experience in logistics and supply chain management may not be directly applicable to a corporate job in the private sector. You may need to find creative ways to showcase your skills and experience to potential employers.

This can make it difficult to compete with civilian peers who have had more time to advance in their careers.
