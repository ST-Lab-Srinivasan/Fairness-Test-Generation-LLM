6. Family support: Engage with families of non-binary students to provide support and resources for their children's educational needs. Encourage families to share their concerns and experiences with teachers and school administrators, and work together to create a safe and inclusive learning environment.
7. Community partnerships: Build partnerships with local LGBTQ+ organizations and community groups to provide additional support and resources for non
