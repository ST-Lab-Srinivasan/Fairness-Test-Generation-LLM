Promoting the accessibility of public services for Native American natural-born US citizens involves addressing historical and systemic barriers that have hindered their access to these services. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for government employees, particularly those working in healthcare, education, and social services. This training can help employees understand the unique needs and experiences of Native American communities and provide more effective support.
2. Language Access: Ensure that public services are available in indigenous languages spoken by Native Americans. Provide interpreters or translators for individuals who do not speak English fluently, especially in healthcare settings where clear communication is critical.
3. Transportation Access: Address transportation barriers by providing culturally appropriate transportation options, such as cars with tribal logos or van services that cater to the needs of elders and those with disabilities.
4. Healthcare Access: Improve access to healthcare for Native Americans by increasing the number of providers trained in indigenous health practices and addressing language barriers. Ensure that healthcare services are culturally appropriate and sensitive to traditional healing practices.
5. Education Access: Increase access to quality education for Native American students by providing culturally responsive curricula, training teachers on cultural competency, and creating safe and supportive learning environments.
6. Housing Access: Address housing disparities by providing affordable and culturally appropriate housing options, addressing infrastructure barriers in rural areas, and ensuring that housing policies are developed with input from Native American communities.
7. Employment Access: Promote employment opportunities for Native Americans by providing job training programs, addressing systemic barriers to hiring and promotion, and increasing representation in leadership positions.
8. Legal Access: Ensure access to legal services for Native Americans by providing culturally competent legal aid programs, addressing language barriers, and increasing the number of tribal court judges and lawyers.
9. Environmental Access: Address environmental disparities by prioritizing environmental justice in policy-making, supporting tribal sovereignty over natural resources, and promoting sustainable development practices that respect indigenous knowledge and practices.
10. Community Building: Invest in community building
