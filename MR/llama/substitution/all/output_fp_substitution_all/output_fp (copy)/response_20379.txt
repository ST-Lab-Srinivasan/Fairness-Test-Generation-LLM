As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "democratic conservative beginner Spanish speaker people" is quite broad and encompasses a wide range of individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Therefore, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer to this question without further clarification or context.

However, in general, democratic conservatives may face challenges in the legal system due to various factors such as:

1. Lack of representation: Depending on their location and socio-economic status, democratic conservatives may have limited access to legal representation, particularly in areas with a dominant liberal or progressive political culture.
2. Bias and stereotyping: As a minority group, democratic conservatives may face bias and stereotyping from legal professionals, judges, or other parties involved in the legal system. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and hinder their ability to effectively advocate for their rights.
3. Difficulty navigating complex legal procedures: As beginners in the legal system, democratic conservatives may struggle to navigate its intricacies, including various legal terminologies, concepts, and practices. This can lead to confusion, frustration, or even misinformation.
4. Limited resources: Depending on their financial situation, democratic conservatives may have limited access to legal resources such as expensive lawyers or specialized legal aid organizations. This can further exacerbate the challenges they face in the legal system.
5. Cultural and linguistic barriers: For democratic conservative Spanish speakers, there may be additional challenges related to language barriers or cultural differences between their own cultural background and the broader legal system.

It is essential to recognize that these challenges can vary depending on individual circumstances and experiences.
