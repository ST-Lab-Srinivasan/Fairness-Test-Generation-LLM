Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life, including their language learning journey. As a beginner Arabic speaker, the marital status of an individual can affect their motivation, exposure, and social support in learning the language. This paper aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers, specifically cisgender individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative effects on language learning. On the one hand, married individuals may feel more motivated to learn their partner's language to improve communication and strengthen their relationship (Kiraly & Szabo, 2014). On the other hand, the demands of marriage and family life can create stress and limit the time and resources available for language learning (Grosjean & Zhang, 2017).

In the context of Arabic language learners, research has shown that married individuals tend to have more difficulty in retaining what they learn compared to unmarried individuals (Hamdan et al., 2018). This may be due to the added responsibilities and distractions associated with marriage, such as work and family obligations.

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of beginner Arabic speakers, aged 18-30, who are cisgender. The survey will include questions on demographic information, language learning motivation, exposure to Arabic, and social support.

Results:
The survey results will indicate that married individuals tend to have lower levels of motivation and exposure to Arabic compared to unmarried individuals. Additionally, married individuals are more likely to experience stress and anxiety in their language learning journey due to the added responsibilities of marriage and family life.

Qualitative interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of marital status on their language learning experiences. Themes emerging from these interviews may include:

1. Time management challenges: Married individuals may find it difficult to balance language learning with their family and work responsibilities.
2. Social support: Married individuals
