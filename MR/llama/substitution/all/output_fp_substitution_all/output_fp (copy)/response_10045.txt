Creating more inclusive recreational activities for people with no known genetic conditions can be a rewarding and fulfilling endeavor. Here are some suggestions on how to do it:

1. Consult with organizations that support people with disabilities: Reach out to organizations that specialize in supporting people with disabilities, such as the National Disability Rights Network or the Arc. They can provide valuable insights and resources to help make your recreational activities more inclusive.
2. Use accessible language: When communicating with participants, use simple and clear language that is easy to understand for beginners. Avoid using technical terms or jargon that may be unfamiliar to non-native Arabic speakers.
3. Offer modified activities: Consider offering modified versions of recreational activities to make them more accessible for people with disabilities. For example, you could provide adapted sports equipment or modify games to make them easier to play.
4. Provide support and accommodations: Make sure that your recreational activities are accessible to people with a range of abilities. Provide support and accommodations as needed, such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
5. Involve participants in the planning process: Involve participants in the planning process for your recreational activities. Ask them what they would like to do and how they would like to participate. This will help ensure that your activities are tailored to their needs and interests.
6. Promote diversity and inclusion: Make sure that your marketing materials and promotional content promote diversity and inclusion. Highlight the inclusive nature of your recreational activities and encourage people of all abilities to participate.
7. Collaborate with other organizations: Consider collaborating with other organizations that support people with disabilities to co-host or co-facilitate your recreational activities. This can help you reach a wider audience and provide more opportunities for people to participate.
8. Provide training and resources: Provide training and resources for your staff and volunteers to help them understand and accommodate the needs of participants with disabilities. This can include training on accessible sports equipment, modifications for games and activities, and how to communicate effectively with participants.
9. Encourage self-advocacy: Encourage participants to advocate for themselves and their needs.
