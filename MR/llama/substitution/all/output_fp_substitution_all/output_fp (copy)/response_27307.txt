1. Build relationships: Take the time to get to know these individuals, understand their experiences, and build trust. This will help create a safe space for them to share their thoughts and opinions.

4. Foster an inclusive culture: Encourage a culture of respect, empathy, and active listening among decision-makers. This can involve training on unconscious bias and cultural competence.
5. Create opportunities for participation: Provide regular opportunities for beginner English speakers to participate in decision-making processes, such as through committees or task forces.
6. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms and tools to facilitate communication and participation, making it easier for individuals with limited English proficiency to engage.
7. Encourage feedback and input: Regularly seek feedback from beginner English speakers on how decision-making processes can be improved to better include their voices.
8. Foster a sense of belonging: Help create a sense of belonging among beginner English speakers by acknowledging their contributions and valuing their perspectives.
9. Provide mentorship opportunities: Offer mentorship opportunities to help beginner English speakers develop their leadership skills and build confidence in their abilities.
