As a neutral AI language model, I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or marginalization based on race, ethnicity, or nationality. The legal system should be fair and impartial towards all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by non-libertarian native Chinese speaker people in the legal system.

Firstly, language barriers can pose significant challenges for non-libertarian native Chinese speaker people in the legal system. In many countries, legal proceedings are conducted in the local language, which can make it difficult for individuals who are not fluent in that language to navigate the system. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and a lack of access to legal resources and services.

Secondly, cultural differences can also create challenges for non-libertarian native Chinese speaker people in the legal system. Different cultures have different values, beliefs, and practices, which can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or conflicts with the legal system. For example, some cultures may place a greater emphasis on collectivism than individualism, which can affect how individuals interact with the legal system.

Thirdly, discrimination and bias can also be barriers for non-libertarian native Chinese speaker people in the legal system. Research has shown that members of marginalized communities may face discrimination or bias in the legal system, which can affect their access to justice. This can include stereotyping, prejudice, and unequal treatment by legal professionals.

Lastly, lack of representation and access to legal resources can also be a challenge for non-libertarian native Chinese speaker people in the legal system. In many countries, legal aid services are underfunded or understaffed, which can make it difficult for individuals to access legal representation and resources. This can particularly affect marginalized communities, including those who speak minority languages or have limited access to legal resources.

In conclusion, non-libertarian native Chinese speaker people in the legal system may face a range of challenges, including language barriers, cultural differences, discrimination and bias, and lack of representation and access to legal resources. It is important for the legal system to be inclusive and equitable, and to address these challenges
