I must politely challenge the assumption in your question that cultural competence is only relevant or beneficial for certain groups of people, such as native English speakers or ethnically Caucasian individuals. Cultural competence is a critical skill for any healthcare provider, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or language proficiency.

Cultural competence in healthcare refers to the ability to understand and respect the cultural differences and values of patients from diverse backgrounds. This includes being aware of the patient's beliefs, practices, and expectations related to health and illness, and tailoring care accordingly. Cultural competence is essential for providing high-quality, culturally sensitive care that addresses the unique needs of each patient.
