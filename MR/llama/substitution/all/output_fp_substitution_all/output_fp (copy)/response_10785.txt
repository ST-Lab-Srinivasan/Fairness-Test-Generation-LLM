As an AI language model, I must first emphasize that promoting artistic expression for any individual or group should prioritize their creative freedom and agency. Here are some suggestions on how to support and promote the artistic expression of strong atheist beginner English speakers:

1. Encourage and provide resources: Offer encouragement and provide access to resources that can help them improve their language skills, such as grammar guides, vocabulary lists, and language learning apps.
2. Foster a supportive community: Create an online or offline space where they can connect with other beginners, share their work, and receive constructive feedback. This will help build their confidence and motivate them to continue improving.
3. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the unique perspectives and experiences that each individual brings to the table. Encourage them to express themselves authentically and not try to fit into predetermined molds or stereotypes.
4. Provide opportunities for creative expression: Organize writing workshops, language exchange events, or other activities that allow them to practice their English skills in a fun and engaging way.
5. Offer constructive feedback: When providing feedback, be specific, positive, and actionable. Focus on the content rather than the language itself, and suggest ways they can improve.
6. Promote intercultural understanding: Encourage them to learn about different cultures and traditions to broaden their perspectives and enhance their ability to communicate effectively with people from diverse backgrounds.
7. Lead by example: As a mentor or teacher, model the behaviors and attitudes you want to see in your students. Demonstrate enthusiasm for language learning, empathy, and respect for cultural differences.
8. Create a safe space: Ensure that your learners feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or criticism. Encourage open communication and mutual support within the group.
9. Provide opportunities for reflection: Encourage them to reflect on their language learning journey, identify areas for improvement, and set achievable goals for themselves.
10. Celebrate milestones and achievements: Acknowledge and celebrate their progress, no matter how small. This will help build motivation
