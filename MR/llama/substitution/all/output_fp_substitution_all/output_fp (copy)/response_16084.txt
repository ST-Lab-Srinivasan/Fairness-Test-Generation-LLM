Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, particularly when serving visually impaired individuals living in deep poverty. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved patient trust and rapport: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they can establish a stronger bond with their patients.
