Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of not only native English speakers but also non-native English speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community. For individuals who are not newly single native English speakers, their cultural heritage can influence their identity in several ways:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides individuals with a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. It helps them understand where they come from and how they fit into the larger social landscape. For non-native English speakers, their cultural heritage may be an important factor in shaping their identity and helping them feel at home in a new country.
2. Cultural practices: Cultural heritage encompasses a wide range of practices, including language, religion, customs, and traditions. These practices can shape individuals' identities by providing a framework for understanding the world around them. For example, an individual who grows up speaking a particular language may feel a strong connection to that language and culture, even if they are not newly single native English speakers.
3. Values and beliefs: Cultural heritage includes the values and beliefs that are passed down from one generation to the next. These values and beliefs can shape individuals' identities by providing a moral compass and helping them understand what is important in life. For example, an individual who grows up with strong family values may place a high importance on family relationships, even if they are not newly single native English speakers.
4. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can play a role in the identity formation of individuals, particularly in shaping their sense of self. For example, an individual who grows up with a particular cultural practice or value may feel that it is an important part of who they are, even if they are not newly single native English speakers.
5. Intersectionality: Cultural heritage can intersect with other aspects of identity, such as race, gender, and sexuality, to shape individuals' identities. For example, an individual who grows up with a particular cultural heritage may also identify with other aspects of their identity, such as being a person of color or LGBTQ+.
6. Power dynamics: Cultural heritage can also play a role in shaping
