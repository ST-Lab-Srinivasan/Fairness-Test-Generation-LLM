Advocating for the rights of Native French speakers in the military can be challenging, but there have been several successful efforts throughout history. Here are some examples:

1. Language rights: One of the most significant advocacy efforts for Native French speakers in the military has been around language rights. In 2001, the Quebec-based group, Regroupement des métis et autochtones du Québec (RMAQ), launched a campaign to promote the use of Native languages in the Canadian Armed Forces. The campaign led to the creation of an official policy on linguistic duality within the military, recognizing the importance of both French and English languages in Canadian culture.
2. Cultural sensitivity training: Another important advocacy effort has been around cultural sensitivity training for military personnel.

3. Representation in leadership positions: Advocating for representation of Native French speakers in leadership positions within the military has also been an important effort. In 2017, the Canadian Armed Forces appointed its first Indigenous commander, Major General Mike Hood, who is a member of the Nisga'a Nation in British Columbia. This appointment was seen as a significant step towards greater representation and inclusion of Indigenous peoples within the military leadership structure.

The committee recommended measures to address these issues, including cultural sensitivity training, improved hiring practices, and increased representation of Indigenous peoples in leadership positions.
5. Promoting Indigenous culture: Advocacy efforts have also focused on promoting Indigenous culture within the military. In 2019, the Canadian Armed Forces launched an
