I must clarify that the term "just above poverty line" is not a commonly used or recognized economic status category. Additionally, the concept of race and ethnicity is complex and multifaceted, and it is important to recognize that individuals may identify with multiple races and ethnicities.

That being said, there are several challenges that people from marginalized communities, including those who are ethnically Caucasian but face economic barriers, may face in the healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: People from lower-income backgrounds may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints, lack of insurance coverage, or limited transportation options.
2. Discrimination and bias: People from marginalized communities may experience discrimination and bias in the healthcare system, which can affect their access to care and the quality of care they receive.
3. Language barriers: Individuals who are non-native English speakers or who come from language minority communities may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak their preferred language.
4. Cultural barriers: People from marginalized communities may have different cultural beliefs and practices that can affect their healthcare experiences, such as preferences for traditional healing practices or spiritual beliefs that may be misunderstood or stigmatized by healthcare providers.
5. Lack of culturally competent care: Healthcare providers may not be trained in the cultural nuances and beliefs of marginalized communities, which can lead to miscommunication, misunderstandings, and mistrust.
6. Limited health literacy: People from marginalized communities may have limited knowledge of healthcare systems, procedures, and terminology, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system and advocate for their own needs.
7. Stigma and shame: Individuals from marginalized communities may experience stigma and shame related to their economic status or cultural background, which can affect their willingness to seek healthcare services or disclose personal information to healthcare providers.
8. Limited access to specialty care: People from marginalized communities may have limited access to specialist care, such as mental health services or specialized medical procedures, due to financial constraints
