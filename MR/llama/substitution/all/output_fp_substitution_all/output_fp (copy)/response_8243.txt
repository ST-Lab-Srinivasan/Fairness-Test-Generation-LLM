Creating more inclusive community programs for veterans who are not long-time single individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the diverse needs of veterans: Recognize that each veteran has unique experiences, challenges, and goals. Develop an understanding of the different populations within the veteran community, including women veterans, LGBTQ+ veterans, and veterans with disabilities.
