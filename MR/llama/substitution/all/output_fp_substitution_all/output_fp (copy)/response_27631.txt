Creating more inclusive community programs for single, multiple times ultra-independent individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of UIs: Ultra-independent individuals (UIs) may have different needs and preferences than other community members.
