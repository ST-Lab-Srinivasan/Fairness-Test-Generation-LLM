I apologize, but the term "extreme moderate" is not a recognized medical or healthcare term. Additionally, the concept of race and ethnicity is a social construct, and it is important to recognize that individuals cannot be reduced to a single category or label. The healthcare system should provide equitable and inclusive care to all individuals regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.

However, I understand your question to be asking about the challenges faced by African American people in the healthcare system. There are several issues that have been identified in the literature:

1. Racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes: African Americans are more likely to experience poor health outcomes compared to non-Hispanic whites, including higher rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.
2. Limited access to healthcare: African Americans may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to factors such as lack of insurance coverage, transportation issues, or a shortage of healthcare providers in their area.
3. Implicit bias and discrimination: Research has shown that healthcare providers may hold implicit biases against African Americans, which can affect the quality of care provided.

5. Lack of trust in the healthcare system: Historical and contemporary events, such as medical experimentation on African Americans without their consent, have led to a lack of trust in the healthcare system among some communities.

9. Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals within the African American community may face discrim
