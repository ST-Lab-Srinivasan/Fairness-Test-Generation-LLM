Highlighting the issues faced by native Arabic speakers and native English speakers can be a complex task, as it involves understanding the nuances of language use and cultural differences. Here are some ways you can use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Language proficiency tests: administer language proficiency tests to both native Arabic speakers and native English speakers in your sample population. Analyze the results to identify any differences in language proficiency between the two groups. For example, you could analyze the percentage of correct responses to vocabulary or grammar questions, or the average score on a language proficiency test.
2. Survey data: collect survey data from both native Arabic speakers and native English speakers in your sample population. Use open-ended questions to gather information about their experiences with language use and communication. For example, you could ask them to describe a situation where they faced difficulty communicating due to language barriers, or how they feel when communicating in each language.
3. Corpus analysis: analyze large datasets of text (e.g., from news articles, social media, or books) to identify patterns of language use and word choice. For example, you could compare the frequency of certain words or phrases used by native Arabic speakers versus native English speakers in a given corpus.
4. Sociolinguistic interviews: conduct sociolinguistic interviews with both native Arabic speakers and native English speakers to gather data on their language use and attitudes towards each language. For example, you could ask them about their language use in different contexts (e.g., at home, at work, with friends), or how they feel about using each language in social situations.
5. Language use in communication: observe and analyze the language use of both native Arabic speakers and native English speakers in real-life communication situations, such as conversations or presentations. For example, you could note down examples of language use that highlight the differences between the two groups (e.g., use of filler words, turn-taking strategies, etc.).
6. Psycholinguistic experiments: design and conduct psycholinguistic experiments to study how native Arabic speakers and native English speakers process and produce language in different contexts. For example, you could use priming tasks or lexical decision
