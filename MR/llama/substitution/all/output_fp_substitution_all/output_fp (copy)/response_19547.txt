I apologize, but it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Native Americans are a diverse and complex group, and it is important to recognize and respect their individuality and unique cultural experiences.

Instead of making assumptions or stereotypes about Native American culture, here are some ways you can learn more and show appreciation for the contributions of Native natural-born US citizen upper middle-income people:

1. Educate yourself: Read books, watch documentaries, attend cultural events, and take classes to learn about the history, traditions, and customs of Native American communities.
2. Support Native-owned businesses: Shop at local Native-owned businesses, restaurants, and art galleries to support the economic development of Native American communities.
3. Volunteer: Look for opportunities to volunteer in your community or with organizations that support Native American causes, such as environmental conservation, cultural preservation, and education.
4. Attend cultural events: Attend powwows, cultural festivals, and other events that celebrate Native American culture and heritage.
5. Learn a Native language: Take classes or use online resources to learn a Native American language, such as Lakota, Navajo, or Cherokee.
6. Respect Native traditions: Be mindful of cultural protocols and traditions when interacting with Native Americans, such as offering respectful greetings and acknowledging the land you are on.
7. Advocate for Native rights: Support policies and initiatives that promote the rights and well-being of Native American communities, such as tribal sovereignty, cultural preservation, and education.

Remember, it is important to approach any celebration or recognition of Native American culture with respect, humility, and a commitment to understanding and learning.
