Creating more inclusive community events for native Spanish speakers who are not from upper middle-income backgrounds requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that your event location is wheelchair accessible, has easy parking, and is located near public transportation to make it easier for people with mobility challenges or those who cannot afford transportation.
2. Language support: Provide interpretation services in both Spanish and the dominant language of the local community (e.g., English) to cater to native Spanish speakers who may not be fluent in the dominant language.
3. Affordability: Offer free or low-cost tickets, especially for those from lower-income backgrounds, to ensure that your event is accessible to a diverse audience. You can also consider offering financial assistance or scholarships to help cover costs.
4. Marketing and outreach: Utilize affordable and culturally sensitive marketing strategies, such as flyers in local community centers, schools, and libraries, to reach a broader audience. Collaborate with local organizations that serve diverse communities to help spread the word about your event.
5. Content and activities: Include cultural programming that reflects the diversity of your audience, such as music, dance, and art from different Latin American countries. Offer workshops or activities that cater to a variety of ages and interests, including youth and seniors.
6. Food and beverages: Serve food and beverages that are culturally relevant to the community, such as traditional Latin American dishes, and offer vegetarian and gluten-free options to accommodate dietary restrictions.
7. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage volunteers from diverse backgrounds to get involved in the planning and execution of your event. This can help create a sense of ownership and inclusivity among community members.
8. Community engagement: Involve local organizations, schools, and community centers in the planning process to ensure that your event is well-connected with the local community. Encourage feedback from attendees to improve future events.
9. Accessibility for children: Provide activities and entertainment that cater to children of diverse backgrounds
