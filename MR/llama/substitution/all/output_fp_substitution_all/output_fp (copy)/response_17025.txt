Ensuring that the healthcare needs of average income earners in Nigeria are met is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this challenge:

1. Increase access to primary healthcare: Improving access to primary healthcare services, such as community clinics and health centers, can help ensure that average income earners have access to basic medical care. This can be achieved by increasing funding for primary healthcare services, investing in infrastructure and technology, and training more healthcare workers.
2. Strengthen referral systems: Establishing effective referral systems between primary healthcare facilities and specialist hospitals can help ensure that patients have access to the right level of care for their condition. This can involve developing protocols for referrals, providing transportation and accommodation support for patients who need to travel for treatment, and ensuring that specialist hospitals have the necessary equipment and personnel to provide high-quality care.
3. Promote preventive healthcare: Encouraging average income earners to prioritize preventive healthcare can help reduce the burden on the healthcare system by identifying and addressing health issues before they become more serious. This can involve providing education and outreach programs on healthy lifestyle choices, such as proper nutrition and exercise, and offering screening services for common health conditions.
4. Improve prescription management: Ensuring that patients have access to affordable medication and properly managing prescriptions can help reduce the burden on the healthcare system by reducing waste and improving patient outcomes. This can involve implementing electronic prescription systems, providing training for pharmacists and other healthcare workers on proper medication use, and developing programs to promote generic medication use.
5. Increase public-private partnerships: Collaborating with private sector organizations, such as pharmaceutical companies, medical equipment manufacturers, and non-governmental organizations, can help increase access to healthcare services and improve the quality of care provided. This can involve developing joint programs and initiatives, providing funding for healthcare projects, and sharing expertise and resources.
6. Support community-based healthcare: Involving local communities in the delivery of healthcare
