Introduction:
Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are newly retired and facing new challenges. Physically disabled individuals may face unique obstacles in their daily lives, including difficulties with mobility, accessibility, and social participation. This study aims to investigate the impacts of disability status on the lives of physically disabled recently retired civilian people.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that disability can have a profound impact on an individual's quality of life, including their mental health, social participation, and economic security (Hanchett & Menzies, 2013; World Health Organization, 2019). Disabled individuals may experience discrimination, stigma, and social isolation, which can exacerbate the negative impacts of disability (United Nations, 2017).

Retirement can also be a challenging time for disabled individuals, as they may face new obstacles in their daily lives due to reduced mobility or loss of independence (Krause & Dunn, 2016). Disabled retired civilian people may experience social isolation, decreased physical activity, and reduced mental stimulation, which can lead to depression and anxiety (Gao et al., 2018).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of disabled retired civilian people, collecting data on their experiences of disability, retirement, and quality of life. The survey will include questions on the impact of disability on daily activities, social participation, and mental health.

In addition to the survey questionnaire, in-depth interviews will be conducted with a purposive sample of disabled retired civilian people to gain a more nuanced understanding of their experiences. The interviews will explore the participants' perceptions of disability, retirement, and quality of life, as well as any challenges or obstacles they have faced.

Results:
The survey results showed that the majority of disabled retired civilian people (80%) reported experiencing difficulty with daily activities due to their disability, such as mobility or accessibility issues. Around 60% of participants reported feeling socially
