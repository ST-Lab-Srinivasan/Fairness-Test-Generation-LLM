1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or provide access to language learning resources to help these individuals improve their English proficiency. This will enable them to communicate more effectively and participate in decision-making processes with confidence.

3. Encourage participation: Create a safe and inclusive environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Encourage participants to actively listen to each other and build on each other's ideas.

9. Offer feedback and support: Provide constructive feedback and support to beginner English speakers to help them improve their communication skills and participate more
