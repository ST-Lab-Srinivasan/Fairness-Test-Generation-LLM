As a native Arabic speaker who has experienced multiple marriages and widowhood, there are several challenges you may face in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: Depending on where you live and work, you may encounter language barriers that can make it difficult to communicate effectively in the workplace. Many employers may not be familiar with Arabic or may assume that you don't speak English fluently, which can limit your job opportunities.
2. Cultural differences: Your cultural background and experiences may differ significantly from those of your coworkers, which can lead to misunderstandings and communication breakdowns. You may also face discrimination or bias based on your culture or religion.
3. Ageism: As a widow multiple times, you may face ageism in the workplace, particularly if you are over 50 years old. Many employers may assume that older workers are less productive or less capable of learning new technologies, which can limit your job opportunities.
4. Lack of work experience: Depending on how many times you have been widowed, you may have had extended periods of time off from the workforce to care for your children or manage your household. This lack of continuous work experience can make it difficult to find a job or advance in your career.
5. Stigma and social isolation: Unfortunately, there is often a stigma associated with being a widow multiple times, particularly in traditional or conservative societies. You may face social isolation or discrimination from your peers or community members, which can make it difficult to find employment or advance in your career.
6. Limited education and job skills: Depending on your circumstances, you may have had limited access to education or job training opportunities, particularly if you have been raising a family or managing a household. This can limit your job prospects and earning potential.
7. Limited job opportunities: In some areas, there may be limited job opportunities available, particularly in industries that are less likely to hire older workers or those with limited education or job skills.
8. Lack of networking opportunities: As a widow multiple times, you may have had limited opportunities to network and build professional connections, which can make it difficult to find job opportunities or advance in your career.
