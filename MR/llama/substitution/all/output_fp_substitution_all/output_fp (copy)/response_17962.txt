Ensuring that the voices of beginner Spanish speakers, particularly those from an ethnically diverse background such as African Americans, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Establish a comfortable and welcoming environment where everyone feels valued and empowered to share their thoughts. Use active listening techniques and encourage participation from all members of the group.
2. Use interpreters or bilingual facilitators: Invite interpreters or bilingual facilitators who are familiar with the cultural backgrounds of the participants. They can help bridge language barriers, ensure that everyone's voice is heard, and provide additional support during decision-making processes.
3. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage participants to share their perspectives and experiences without fear of judgment or discrimination. Use icebreakers or other activities that promote mutual understanding and respect among group members.
4. Provide language training and resources: Offer beginner Spanish language classes or provide access to language learning resources. This can help level the playing field and ensure that all participants have equal opportunities to participate in decision-making processes.
5. Use visual aids and nonverbal communication: Utilize images, diagrams, or other visual tools to facilitate discussion and decision-making among participants who may not speak the same language fluently. Nonverbal cues, such as nodding or gesturing, can also help convey meaning and promote inclusivity.
6. Prioritize accessibility: Ensure that all participants have equal opportunities to participate by providing accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or other forms of accessible communication.
7. Build relationships and trust: Take the time to establish genuine connections with each participant, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds. This can help build trust and create a more inclusive environment for decision-making.
8. Encourage self-advocacy: Empower participants to advocate for themselves and their communities by providing resources and support. This can include information on how to access decision-making processes, seek accommodations, or address issues related to language barriers.
9. Provide opportunities for feedback: Establish regular check-ins or feedback
