Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Recently Married Multiple Times Beginner Arabic Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially when it comes to newly married couples who are learning a new language and culture. In this study, we aim to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of recently married multiple times beginner Arabic speakers. We will explore how their cultural backgrounds affect their language learning experience, identity formation, and relationship dynamics.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can significantly impact an individual's language learning process and identity formation (Kim &amp; Yang, 2016; Liu &amp; Chang, 2015). Cultural heritage includes the customs, beliefs, values, and practices of a particular group or community. When individuals from different cultural backgrounds interact with each other, they bring their unique cultural identities to the table, which can lead to conflicts or misunderstandings if not managed properly.

In the context of newly married couples, cultural heritage can play a crucial role in shaping their identities and relationship dynamics. For example, in some cultures, communication styles may differ significantly, leading to misunderstandings or conflict. In other cultures, gender roles and expectations may be more defined, affecting the power dynamics within the relationship.

Methodology:
Our study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with 20 newly married couples who have previously been married multiple times and are currently learning Arabic as a second language. Participants will be recruited through local community centers, mosques, and online forums catering to Arabic learners.

Data collection and analysis:
We will conduct in-depth interviews with each couple, focusing on their cultural backgrounds, language learning experiences, and relationship dynamics. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. We will analyze the data using thematic analysis, identifying patterns and themes that emerge from the participants' responses.

Expected Findings:
Our study expects to uncover several ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of newly married multiple times beginner Arab
