I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to celebrate the cultural contributions of specific racial or ethnic groups in a way that reinforces or perpetuates social hierarchy or discrimination. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity and individuality within any given group, and to avoid making generalizations or assumptions based on race or class.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to celebrate and appreciate the cultural contributions of all individuals, regardless of their race or socioeconomic background. Here are some suggestions:

1. Learn about and appreciate the cultural heritage of different ethnic groups: Research the history, traditions, and customs of various racial and ethnic groups, and learn how they have contributed to society.
2. Support inclusive events and initiatives: Attend events that celebrate diversity and promote cross-cultural understanding, such as cultural festivals, art exhibits, or community service projects.
3. Engage in dialogue and listen actively: Listen to the experiences and perspectives of people from different backgrounds, and engage in open and respectful dialogue about your own assumptions and biases.
4. Speak up against discrimination and inequality: When you witness discriminatory behavior or language, speak up and challenge it. Use your voice to advocate for the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their race or socioeconomic status.
5. Educate yourself on systemic inequality: Learn about the structural barriers and systems of oppression that have historically marginalized certain groups, such as racism, sexism, and classism.
6. Support organizations that promote diversity and inclusion: Donate to or volunteer with organizations that work towards promoting diversity and inclusion in your community.
7. Be mindful of language and representation: Avoid using language or representing marginalized groups in a way that is offensive or stereotypical. Be aware of the impact of your words and actions on others, and strive to be respectful and inclusive.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of ethnically full Asian non-lower-class people (or any other group) should not be done at the expense of perpetuating social hierarchy or discrimination. Instead,
