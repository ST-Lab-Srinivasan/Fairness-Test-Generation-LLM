Active duty military service can be challenging for any individual, regardless of their race or ethnicity. However, for ethnically African American military personnel, there are additional considerations and challenges that may arise due to systemic barriers and biases within the military. Here are some support systems that are important for active duty military ethnically full African Americans:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Providing cultural competency training for all military personnel can help them understand and appreciate the unique experiences and challenges faced by ethnically African American individuals in the military. This training can help promote a more inclusive and supportive environment within the military.
2. Mentorship Programs: Mentorship programs that pair ethnically African American service members with senior leaders or mentors from their own racial and ethnic group can provide valuable guidance, support, and role models. These programs can help ethnically African American service members navigate the military's structure and culture more effectively.
3. Peer Support Groups: Creating peer support groups specifically for ethnically African American service members can provide a safe space for them to share their experiences, receive emotional support, and build relationships with others who understand their unique challenges. These groups can help foster a sense of community and belonging within the military.
4. Diversity and Inclusion Training: Offering regular diversity and inclusion training for all military personnel can help promote a culture of inclusivity and respect within the military. This training can help service members recognize and address their own biases and microaggressions, which can contribute to a more supportive environment for ethnically African American service members.
5. Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs): EAPs provide confidential counseling services for military personnel dealing with personal or professional challenges. Ethnically African American service members may benefit from access to culturally sensitive counseling services that can help them address specific concerns related to their race, ethnicity, or military experiences.
6. Command Support: Ensuring that commanders and supervisors are aware of the unique challenges faced by ethnically African American service members and are trained to provide supportive leadership can go a long way in creating a more inclusive environment within the military. This may involve providing training on cultural competency, implicit bias, and diversity and inclusion.
