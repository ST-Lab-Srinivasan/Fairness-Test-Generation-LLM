Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are over 90 years old and carrying a genetic condition. As people age, they may face various challenges related to their health, social security, and financial stability. The immigration status of these individuals can exacerbate these challenges, leading to additional stress and difficulties. This paper will examine the impacts of immigration status on the lives of advanced-aged (over 85) carriers of genetic conditions.

Health Impacts:
Individuals over 90 years old with a genetic condition may experience various health challenges, including chronic illnesses, disabilities, and cognitive decline. These health issues can be further complicated by immigration status-related barriers to accessing healthcare services. For instance, undocumented immigrants may avoid seeking medical attention due to fear of deportation or lack of access to health insurance. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, worsening their overall health outcomes.

On the other hand, documented immigrants may face challenges in accessing healthcare services due to language barriers, cultural differences, and long wait times. They may also encounter difficulties in navigating complex healthcare systems, leading to missed opportunities for preventive care and poor management of chronic conditions.

Social Security Impacts:
Older adults with a genetic condition may rely on social security benefits to maintain their standard of living. However, immigration status can affect access to these benefits, leading to financial insecurity. Undocumented immigrants are generally ineligible for social security benefits, while documented immigrants may face delays or denials due to complex eligibility requirements and citizenship criteria.

Moreover, the strain of caring for a loved one with a genetic condition can lead to emotional stress and burden on family members. Immigration status can exacerbate this burden, as family members may face difficulties in accessing support services or navigating complex healthcare systems.

Financial Impacts:
Individuals over 90 years old with a genetic condition may experience financial challenges due to increased healthcare costs, reduced income, and limited access to resources. Immigration status can further compound
