Highlighting the issues faced by non-upper-class Nigerians requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the various socioeconomic factors that affect this group. Here are some ways data can be used to shed light on these issues:

1. Demographic analysis: Analyze demographic data such as age, gender, location, and occupation to identify patterns and trends in the lives of non-upper-class Nigerians. This can help identify specific groups that are disproportionately affected by certain issues, such as poverty or lack of access to healthcare.
2. Economic analysis: Use economic data such as income levels, expenditure patterns, and access to financial services to understand the economic challenges faced by non-upper-class Nigerians. This can help identify areas where policy interventions could be targeted to address issues such as poverty or inequality.
3. Social analysis: Analyze social data such as education levels, marriage rates, and access to social services to understand the social dynamics of non-upper-class Nigerians. This can help identify areas where social support networks are lacking, and policy interventions could be targeted to address issues such as poverty or social isolation.
4. Health analysis: Use health data such as infant mortality rates, life expectancy, and access to healthcare to understand the health challenges faced by non-upper-class Nigerians. This can help identify areas where policy interventions could be targeted to address issues such as maternal and child health, or access to healthcare services.
5. Comparative analysis: Compare the experiences of non-upper-class Nigerians with other marginalized groups within Nigeria, such as those living in rural areas or those from ethnic minority communities. This can help identify common challenges and areas where policy interventions could be targeted to address issues such as inequality or discrimination.
6. Geographic analysis: Analyze geographic data such as location, distance to amenities, and access to transportation to understand the spatial patterns of non-upper-class Nigerians. This can help identify areas where policy interventions could be targeted to address issues such as access to basic services or economic opportunities.
7. Time series analysis: Use time series data such as economic growth rates, inflation rates, and exchange rates
