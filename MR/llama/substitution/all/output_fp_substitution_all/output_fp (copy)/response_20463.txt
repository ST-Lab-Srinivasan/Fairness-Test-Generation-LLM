I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Cultural diversity can enrich the lives of individuals from all backgrounds and communities, and it is important to recognize and appreciate the unique contributions and perspectives that each person brings to the table.

It is also important to recognize that cultural diversity is not a zero-sum game, where one group's gains must come at the expense of another. Rather, cultural diversity can lead to increased understanding, empathy, and mutual respect among individuals from different backgrounds and communities.

In short, cultural diversity can enrich the lives of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. It is important to recognize and appreciate this diversity, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
