It is important to recognize that the experiences of Mandarin-speaking individuals within the legal system can vary greatly depending on a range of factors, including their individual circumstances, the specific legal context they are navigating, and broader societal attitudes towards race and ethnicity. However, there are some potential challenges that Mandarin-speaking individuals may face in the legal system:
