I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote discrimination or exclusion of any individual or group based on their citizenship status. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their citizenship status, have the right to participate in recreational activities and sports, as long as they are not engaging in any illegal or unethical behavior.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity and diversity in casual athletics by creating a welcoming and respectful environment for all participants. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Encourage diversity: Actively seek out and encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds to participate in casual athletics. This can be done by reaching out to local communities, schools, and organizations that cater to underrepresented groups.
2. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to help individuals overcome any barriers they may face in participating in casual athletics, such as financial constraints or lack of access to facilities.
3. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusivity and respect among all participants by promoting positive communication, empathy, and mutual understanding.
4. Address discrimination: Take prompt action to address any instances of discrimination or exclusion that may occur during casual athletic activities. This can include providing education and training on inclusivity and diversity, as well as implementing policies and procedures for reporting and addressing incidents of discrimination.

By following these strategies, you can help promote a more inclusive and diverse environment in casual athletics, where all individuals can participate and enjoy the benefits of physical activity without fear of discrimination or exclusion.
