As a long-term temporary visa holder who is also a low-income person, I bring a unique perspective to the table. Here are some of the things that I have observed and experienced:

1. Invisible marginalization: As a temporary visa holder, I often feel invisible in society. I am not considered a permanent resident or citizen, so my voice is often marginalized in conversations about immigration policy and social welfare programs. However, as a low-income person, I am also marginalized in discussions about poverty and economic inequality. This dual marginalization can make it difficult to advocate for myself and my community.
2. Economic instability: As a low-income person, I experience economic instability on a daily basis. I struggle to pay rent, afford food, and access basic necessities like healthcare. This instability can make it difficult to plan for the future or invest in my education or career. However, as a temporary visa holder, I also face uncertainty about my immigration status and the possibility of deportation. This creates additional stress and anxiety that can impact my mental and physical health.
3. Lack of access to resources: As a low-income person, I often lack access to resources like education, healthcare, and legal services. This can make it difficult to navigate the immigration system or advocate for myself in situations where I need support. However, as a temporary visa holder, I may also face barriers to accessing these resources due to my immigration status.
4. Cultural exchange: As a long-term temporary visa holder, I have had the opportunity to experience different cultures and ways of life. This has given me a unique perspective on the world and allowed me to connect with people from diverse backgrounds. However, as a low-income person, I may also face discrimination or marginalization based on my race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
5. Resilience and adaptability: As a long-term temporary visa holder who is also a low-income person, I have developed a strong sense of resilience and adaptability. I have learned to navigate complex systems and advocate for myself in difficult situations. This has helped me to overcome challenges and find creative solutions to problems.
