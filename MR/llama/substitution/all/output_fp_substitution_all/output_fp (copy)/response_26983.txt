The impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly very young people in their 90s or older, can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to education: In some countries with authoritarian regimes, access to education may be restricted based on political affiliation. Beginner Arabic speakers from marginalized groups, such as minorities or opposition supporters, may face barriers in accessing quality education due to their political beliefs.
2. Employment opportunities: Political affiliation can affect employment opportunities, particularly in countries with limited job prospects. Beginner Arabic speakers who are members of marginalized groups may find it challenging to secure gainful employment due to their political beliefs or affiliations.
3. Social exclusion: In some societies, political affiliation can lead to social exclusion, particularly for those who hold unpopular views. Beginner Arabic speakers who are members of marginalized groups may experience social isolation or discrimination due to their political beliefs.
4. Safety and security: Political affiliation can impact safety and security, particularly in countries with limited rule of law or high levels of political violence. Beginner Arabic speakers who are members of marginalized groups may face harassment, intimidation, or violence due to their political beliefs.
5. Psychological impact: Living in a politically charged environment can have a significant psychological impact on beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those in their 90s or older. Chronic stress, anxiety, and feelings of hopelessness can result from living in a society with limited political freedoms and high levels of political polarization.
6. Cultural expression: Political affiliation can influence cultural expression, as some groups may be discouraged from expressing their cultural heritage or identity due to political considerations. Beginner Arabic speakers who are members of marginalized groups may face restrictions on their ability to practice and express their cultural traditions.
7. Community engagement: Political affiliation can affect community engagement, particularly in societies with limited civil society participation. Beginner Arabic speakers who are members of marginalized groups may find it challenging to participate in community activities or organizations due to their political belief
