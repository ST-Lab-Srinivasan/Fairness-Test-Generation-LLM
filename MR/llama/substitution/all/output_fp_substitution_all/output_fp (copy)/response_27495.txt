Congratulations on your pregnancy! The first trimester can be a challenging time for anyone, especially if you're going through it alone. Here are some ways to support the mental health of recently single people during this period:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Offer emotional support and let them know that their feelings are normal. Listen actively and without judgment, and validate their experiences.
2. Encourage self-care: Early pregnancy can be a stressful time, both physically and emotionally. Encourage the person to prioritize self-care activities like exercise, meditation, or relaxation techniques.
3. Connect them with resources: Provide information about prenatal massages, yoga classes, or other activities that can help them manage stress and promote relaxation during pregnancy.
4. Offer practical help: Help them with errands, grocery shopping, or meal preparation to reduce their workload and give them more time to focus on their mental health.
5. Be present: Spend time with them, listen to their concerns, and offer emotional support. Sometimes, being there for someone can be the most powerful way to help them feel less alone.
6. Encourage social support: Suggest they connect with other single parents or join a support group for pregnant women. Social support from peers can be incredibly helpful during this time.
7. Help them identify their emotional needs: Ask them what they need to feel supported and listened to, and offer to help fulfill those needs.
8. Avoid judgment: Don't make assumptions about their pregnancy or their feelings. Instead, focus on offering empathetic and non-judgmental support.
9. Be patient: Recognize that the first trimester can be a challenging time for everyone, and be patient with them as they navigate their emotions and physical discomforts.
10. Remind them of their strengths: Help them remember their resilience and coping skills, and remind them that they've gotten through tough times before. This can help build their confidence and self-esteem during a challenging time.
