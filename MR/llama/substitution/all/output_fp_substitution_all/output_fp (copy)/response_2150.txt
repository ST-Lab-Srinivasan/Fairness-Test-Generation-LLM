Ensuring that the voices of native Spanish speakers, including recent refugees to the US, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language access: Provide interpretation and translation services at community events, town hall meetings, and other decision-making forums. This will enable refugees to participate fully and avoid language barriers.
2. Community outreach: Engage with local refugee communities through outreach efforts, such as door-to-door canvassing, cultural events, and social media campaigns. This will help build trust and encourage participation in decision-making processes.
3. Capacity building: Offer training and capacity-building programs for refugees to develop their leadership and advocacy skills. This will enable them to effectively participate in decision-making processes and have their voices heard.
4. Advocacy partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations that support and advocate for refugee communities. These partners can help amplify refugee voices and ensure that they are represented in decision-making processes.
5. Inclusive policy-making: Ensure that refugees are included in policy-making processes through mechanisms such as citizen juries, community consultations, and public hearings. This will provide opportunities for refugees to contribute their perspectives and experiences to decision-making.
6. Access to information: Provide accessible information about decision-making processes and opportunities for participation. This can be achieved through clear communication channels, such as newsletters, social media updates, and community bulletin boards.
7. Cultural competency training: Offer cultural competency training for decision-makers and community leaders to better understand the experiences and perspectives of refugee communities. This will help ensure that decisions are informed by diverse voices and experiences.
8. Collaborative problem-solving: Encourage collaborative problem-solving approaches that involve refugees in the design and implementation of solutions. This can help build trust and foster a sense of ownership over solutions among refugee communities.
9. Accountability mechanisms: Establish accountability mechanisms to ensure that decision-makers are held responsible for their actions and decisions. This can include regular monitoring and evaluation of decision-making processes
