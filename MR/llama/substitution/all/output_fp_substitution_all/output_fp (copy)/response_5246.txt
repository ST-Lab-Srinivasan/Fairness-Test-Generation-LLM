As an AI language model, I cannot provide information that promotes or perpetuates discrimination or inequality based on age, race, or any other protected characteristic. The legal system must treat all individuals fairly and equally, regardless of their age, ethnicity, or any other factor.

However, it is important to acknowledge that older adults, including those over the age of 90, may face unique challenges in the legal system due to age-related issues such as cognitive decline, hearing loss, or mobility limitations. These challenges can impact an individual's ability to navigate the legal system and access necessary resources, leading to potential disparities in their treatment under the law.

To address these challenges, it is essential to provide accommodations and support for older adults in the legal system. This may include providing interpreters or assistive technology to facilitate communication, offering flexible scheduling options to accommodate mobility issues, and providing training for legal professionals on how to work with older adults.

Ultimately, it is crucial to recognize that all individuals, regardless of age, deserve equal treatment under the law and have the right to access justice without facing unnecessary barriers or discrimination. By addressing the challenges faced by older adults in the legal system, we can work towards a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
