To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish speaker Nigerian individuals, you could consider the following steps:

1. Identify the population: Determine the specific group of individuals you want to study, such as Nigerians living in Nigeria or those living abroad. You may also want to consider their level of proficiency in Spanish, whether they are complete beginners or have some prior knowledge.
2. Gather data: Collect data on the challenges and issues faced by these individuals through surveys, interviews, or observations. You could ask questions such as:
	* What are the main obstacles to learning Spanish for you?
	* How do you find the most difficult aspects of learning a new language?
	* Have you encountered any discrimination or bias due to your language proficiency?
	* How do you think your language skills could improve your daily life or career opportunities?
3. Analyze the data: Use statistical analysis or thematic coding to identify patterns and trends in the data. You may find that certain issues are more common among beginner Spanish speakers, such as difficulties with grammar or pronunciation, lack of exposure to the language, or limited access to resources for learning.
4. Visualize the data: Use charts, graphs, or other visualizations to present your findings in a clear and accessible way. This could include heat maps, bar charts, or scatter plots that illustrate the most common issues faced by beginner Spanish speakers.
5. Create recommendations: Based on your analysis, provide suggestions for how to address the identified issues. For example, you could recommend additional language learning resources, suggest ways to improve access to language learning opportunities, or offer strategies for overcoming common challenges faced by beginner Spanish speakers.
6. Share the findings: Present your research and recommendations to relevant stakeholders, such as language learning institutions, government agencies, or community organizations. This could help raise awareness of the issues faced by beginner Spanish speakers and inform efforts to address them.

Some potential data sources for this project include:

* Surveys or questionnaires distributed to beginner Spanish speakers in Nigeria or other countries
* Interviews with beginner Spanish speakers, either in person or through online platforms
* Observations of language learning environments or communities
* Existing research
