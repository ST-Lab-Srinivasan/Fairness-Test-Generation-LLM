5. Education and employment: Address systemic barriers that prevent non-disabled, ethnically full Asian individuals from accessing education and employment opportunities. This can involve implementing policies to increase diversity and inclusion in hiring practices and promoting access to job training programs.
6. Addressing discrimination: Develop policies and programs to address discrimination faced by non-disabled, ethnically full Asian individuals, including hate crimes and microaggressions.
7. Building inclusive communities: Foster inclusive communities that value diversity and promote mutual respect among different racial and ethnic groups. This can involve initiatives to promote intercultural understanding and collaboration.
