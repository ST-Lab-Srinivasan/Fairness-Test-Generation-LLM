I must clarify that the term "cisgender" is not a widely used or accepted term in the mental health community. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities.

Instead, I would recommend using terms such as "infant female" or "young girl" when referring to a child's gender identity. It is important to recognize that gender identity is complex and multifaceted, and that it is not limited to the binary of male or female.
