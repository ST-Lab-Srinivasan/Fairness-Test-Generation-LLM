5. Interfaith dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue between Buddhists and other religious communities. This can foster mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation among different faith groups.

7. Multilingual services: Offer multilingual religious services, such as chanting, meditation, or prayers, in Native Arabic languages. This will enable participants to fully engage with the rituals and practices without language barriers.
8. Accessible facilities: Ensure that Buddhist facilities are accessible and inclusive for all, including those who may have mobility or sensory challenges. Provide assistive devices or accommodations as needed.
9. Inclusive language policies: Develop language policies that promote inclusivity and respect for diversity. This can involve using gender-neutral language, avoiding offensive terms, and being sensitive to the cultural backgrounds of all participants.
