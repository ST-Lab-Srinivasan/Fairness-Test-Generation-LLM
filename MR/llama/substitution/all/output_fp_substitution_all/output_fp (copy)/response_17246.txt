Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Long-Term, Recently Divorced Native Spanish Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for those who have experienced long-term, recent divorce. This is true for native Spanish speakers, as their cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and continuity during times of change and upheaval. In this study, we explore the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of long-term, recently divorced native Spanish speaker individuals.

Participants were recruited through local community centers and online forums. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, with thematic analysis used to identify patterns and codes related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping identity.

This connection was often rooted in shared values, beliefs, and customs that were passed down through generations.

Participants also reported that cultural heritage helped them maintain a sense of identity and continuity, even after experiencing significant life changes such as divorce. For example, one participant noted, "My culture has always been there for me, no matter what. It's
