Title: The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Happily Newly Widowed Native Spanish Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of happily newly widowed native Spanish speakers. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and their experiences of grief and mourning.

Theoretical Framework:
This study draws on the theoretical framework of symbolic interactionism, which posits that individuals create and negotiate meaning through their interactions with others and their environments. Cultural heritage is seen as a crucial aspect of this negotiation, as it provides individuals with a shared set of values, beliefs, and practices that shape their understanding of themselves and their place in the world.

Methods:
This study employs a qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from 20 happily newly widowed native Spanish speakers. Participants were selected through purposive sampling, based on their recent loss of a spouse and their self-identification as native Spanish speakers. Interviews were conducted in person or via video conferencing, depending on the participants' preferences.

Results:
The analysis of the interviews revealed several key themes related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of happily newly widowed native Spanish speakers. These include:

1. Cultural heritage as a source of comfort and support: Many participants reported turning to their cultural heritage for comfort and support during the grieving process. This included engaging in traditional practices, such as attending cultural events or participating in religious rituals, as well as drawing on cultural values and beliefs to make sense of their loss.
2. Cultural identity as a source of strength: Participants described how their cultural heritage provided them with a sense of strength and resilience during the grieving process. This included drawing on cultural practices and values to find meaning and purpose in life after loss.
3. The importance of cultural continuity: Many participants emphasized the importance of preserving their cultural heritage for future generations. This included passing on cultural traditions and practices to their children and grandchildren, as well as ensuring that their cultural identity remained intact despite their loss.
