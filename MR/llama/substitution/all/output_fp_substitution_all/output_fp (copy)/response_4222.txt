As a senior AI language model, I'm happy to help with your question! Here are some ways to support the educational aspirations of recent green card holders to Canada who are newly single:

1. Explore financial assistance programs: There are several financial assistance programs available in Canada that can help recent immigrants fund their education. These programs include the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP), the Canada Student Grants, and the Quebec Education Savings Incentive. Encourage your friend to research and explore these options.
2. Look into scholarships: There are numerous scholarships available for international students in Canada, especially for those who are newly single. Encourage your friend to research and apply for these scholarships to help fund their education.
3. Provide emotional support: Moving to a new country and going through a breakup can be emotionally challenging. Offer emotional support by listening to your friend's concerns, being present for them, and encouraging them to take breaks when needed.
4. Help with language barriers: If your friend is not fluent in English or French (the official languages of Canada), help them find resources to improve their language skills. This can include language classes, language exchange programs, or tutoring services.
5. Introduce them to local communities: Encourage your friend to get involved in local communities, such as volunteering, joining clubs or organizations, or attending events. This can help them meet new people and build connections in their new home.
6. Assist with job search: Help your friend research and find job opportunities that match their skills and experience. You can also offer to review their resume or cover letter, or provide feedback on their interviewing skills.
7. Offer to help with everyday tasks: Newly single immigrants may have a lot on their plate, so offer to help with everyday tasks such as grocery shopping, cooking, or cleaning. This can help them manage their time and energy more effectively.
8. Encourage them to take care of themselves: Moving to a new country and going through a breakup can be stressful. Encourage your friend to prioritize self-care by getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, and practicing mindfulness or meditation.
