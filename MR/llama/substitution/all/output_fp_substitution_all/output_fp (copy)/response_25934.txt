The impact of immigration status on the lives of physically able-bodied late pregnancy (3rd trimester) people can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care, leading to delays or omissions in necessary medical tests and treatments. This can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Legally present immigrants may also experience difficulties in accessing healthcare due to language barriers, cultural differences, or lack of knowledge about the healthcare system.
2. Fear of deportation: The fear of being deported can lead to anxiety, stress, and depression among pregnant immigrants, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being. This fear can also make it more challenging for them to seek medical attention, especially in emergency situations.
3. Limited social support: Immigrants may face difficulties in building social connections and networks due to language barriers, cultural differences, or discrimination. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can negatively impact their mental health during pregnancy.
4. Financial stress: Pregnant immigrants may experience financial stress due to lack of access to affordable healthcare, limited job opportunities, or unstable living conditions. This can lead to anxiety and stress, which can negatively impact the mother's mental and physical health during pregnancy.
5. Lack of access to resources: Immigrants may face barriers in accessing resources such as parenting classes, breastfeeding support, or postpartum care. This can lead to a lack of knowledge about caring for a newborn, which can negatively impact the baby's health and well-being.
6. Discrimination and stigma: Pregnant immigrants may face discrimination and stigma due to their immigration status, which can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, or inadequacy. This can negatively impact their mental health during pregnancy and parenting.
7. Limited legal rights: Undocumented immigrants may have limited legal rights and protections during pregnancy, such as access to prenatal care or protection from workplace
