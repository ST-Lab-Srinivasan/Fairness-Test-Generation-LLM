Ensuring that the voices of openly strongly gay active-duty individuals are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and diversity within the military. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this:

1. Establish an LGBTQ+ Advisory Group: The military could establish an LGBTQ+ advisory group composed of openly strongly gay active-duty individuals. This group could provide input and advice on issues affecting the LGBTQ+ community within the military, such as policies, procedures, and training programs.
2. Provide Training on LGBTQ+ Issues: The military could provide training for decision-makers on LGBTQ+ issues, including the history of the LGBTQ+ rights movement, the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in the military, and strategies for creating a more inclusive environment.
3. Incorporate LGBTQ+ Perspectives into Decision-Making: The military could make a conscious effort to incorporate LGBTQ+ perspectives into decision-making processes. This could involve actively seeking out input from LGBTQ+ individuals and organizations, as well as ensuring that LGBTQ+ voices are represented in decision-making forums.
4. Use of LGBTQ+ Identifiers: The military could use LGBTQ+ identifiers such as "LGBTQ+" or "gay" instead of the more general term "homosexual". This would help to recognize and respect the diversity of identities within the community, including those who identify as bisexual, transgender, queer, and others.
5. Visibility and Role Modeling: The military could actively promote visibility and role modeling of openly strongly gay active-duty individuals. This could involve highlighting their achievements and successes in military publications, social media, and other channels.
6. Policy Reforms: The military could review and reform policies that impact LGBTQ+ individuals, such as those related to deployment, benefits, and discrimination. This could involve consultation with LGBTQ+ organizations and experts to ensure that policies are inclusive and supportive of LGBTQ+ individuals.
7. Accountability Mechanisms
