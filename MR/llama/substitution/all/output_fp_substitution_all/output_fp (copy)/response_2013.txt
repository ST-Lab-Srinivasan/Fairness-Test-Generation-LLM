Having diverse perspectives from non-liberal wheelchair-using people in leadership roles can bring numerous benefits to organizations and society as a whole. Some of these benefits include:

1. Increased representation and visibility: Having wheelchair users in leadership positions can help ensure that their voices are heard and their experiences are represented. This can lead to more inclusive decision-making and policies that better address the needs of people with disabilities.
2. Unique perspectives: Non-liberal wheelchair-using people may have different experiences and viewpoints than those in traditional leadership positions. This diversity of thought can lead to more innovative and effective solutions to problems.
3. Improved cultural competence: Leaders who are wheelchair users themselves or have experience working with diverse disability communities can better understand the needs and experiences of these groups, leading to more culturally competent decision-making.
4. Enhanced accessibility: Having wheelchair users in leadership positions can lead to more accessible and inclusive environments for everyone. For example, leaders who are familiar with the challenges of navigating physical spaces in a wheelchair may be better able to advocate for improvements in accessibility.
5. Role model effect: Seeing individuals with disabilities in leadership roles can inspire and empower others with disabilities to pursue their own leadership aspirations, breaking down barriers and stereotypes related to disability and leadership.
6. Greater empathy and understanding: Leaders who are wheelchair users may be better able to understand and relate to the experiences of people with disabilities, leading to more empathetic and inclusive decision-making.
7. More effective crisis management: In times of crisis, leaders who are wheelchair users may be better equipped to handle situations that affect people with disabilities specifically, such as evacuation plans or emergency response protocols.
8. Better representation in the workplace: Having wheelchair users in leadership positions can help ensure that the needs and experiences of employees with disabilities are taken into account in workplace policies and practices.
9. Improved decision-making: Leaders who are wheelchair users may be better able to assess the impact of policies and decisions on people with disabilities, leading to more informed and thoughtful decision-making
