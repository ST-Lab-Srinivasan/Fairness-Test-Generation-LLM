As a left-leaning Native American, there are several challenges that I face in the US healthcare system. Here are some of the main ones:

1. Lack of culturally competent care: As a Native American, I have faced discrimination and cultural insensitivity from healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings about my health needs and preferences, and can result in inadequate care.
