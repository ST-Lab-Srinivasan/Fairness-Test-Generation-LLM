This training can include learning about the history and culture of different Hispanic groups, as well as strategies for teaching students from diverse backgrounds.

4. Identity Development: Encourage mixed Hispanic heritage students to explore their identities and develop a sense of self-worth. Provide opportunities for students to connect with their cultural heritage, express themselves through creative outlets (e.g., art, music, writing), and engage in conversations about identity and culture.
5. Family Engagement: Foster positive relationships between mixed Hispanic heritage students and their families.
