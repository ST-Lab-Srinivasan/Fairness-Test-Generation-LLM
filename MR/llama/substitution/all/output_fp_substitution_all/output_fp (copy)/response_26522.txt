Ensuring that the voices of native English speakers who are not long-time single individuals are heard in decision-making processes is essential for promoting diversity and inclusivity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create opportunities for participation: Organizations should create opportunities for native English speakers from diverse backgrounds to participate in decision-making processes. This can be done by providing a platform for them to share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences.
2. Foster an inclusive culture: Organizations should strive to create an inclusive culture that values diversity and promotes equality. This can be achieved by promoting diversity and inclusion initiatives, providing training on unconscious bias, and creating a safe and respectful workplace.
3. Use diverse decision-making groups: Organizations should use diverse decision-making groups that include native English speakers from different backgrounds. This can help ensure that a wide range of perspectives are considered in the decision-making process.
4. Encourage mentorship and sponsorship: Organizations should encourage mentorship and sponsorship programs that pair native English speakers with more experienced professionals. This can help provide guidance and support to individuals who may be underrepresented in decision-making processes.
5. Collect data on underrepresented groups: Organizations should collect data on the representation of underrepresented groups, including native English speakers, in decision-making processes. This can help identify areas where improvement is needed and track progress over time.
6. Provide opportunities for professional development: Organizations should provide opportunities for professional development that are tailored to the needs of native English speakers from diverse backgrounds. This can help them build skills and confidence in their roles and contribute more effectively in decision-making processes.
7. Foster a culture of collaboration: Organizations should foster a culture of collaboration that encourages individuals from different backgrounds to work together and share their perspectives. This can help ensure that a wide range of voices are heard in decision-making processes.
8. Use technology to facilitate participation: Organizations can use technology, such as video conferencing tools, to facilitate participation from remote locations. This can help ensure that individuals who may face barriers to participation due to location or mobility can still contribute to decision-making processes
