4. Adaptability: Be adaptable and willing to adjust the cultural program based on feedback from hearing-impaired individuals. This can include changing the volume level, lighting, or seating arrangements to make the experience more comfortable for them.
5. Collaboration: Collaborate with organizations that support hearing-impaired individuals to co-create and deliver cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are tailored to their needs and preferences.
6. Outreach: Reach out to hearing-impaired communities and organizations to raise awareness about the cultural program and encourage participation.
7. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all communication materials, including brochures, posters, and website content.

9. Training: Provide training for staff and volunteers on how to use assistive technologies to support hearing-impaired individuals.
