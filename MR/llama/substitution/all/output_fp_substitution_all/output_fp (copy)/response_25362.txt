As a happily newly widowed, long-term green card holder, you may face several challenges in the US legal system. Here are some potential issues to be aware of:

1. Lack of inheritance rights: As a non-citizen, you may not have the same inheritance rights as US citizens or permanent residents. This can make it difficult for you to inherit property or assets from your deceased spouse.
2. Limited access to social security benefits: As a non-citizen, you may not be eligible for certain social security benefits, such as survivor benefits.
3. Difficulty navigating the court system: Depending on the state and locality where you reside, you may face challenges in navigating the legal system, particularly if you are not familiar with US laws and regulations.
4. Limited access to healthcare: As a non-citizen, you may not have the same access to healthcare as US citizens or permanent residents. This can be particularly challenging if you have ongoing medical needs or require expensive treatments.
5. Discrimination or bias: Unfortunately, there are still instances of discrimination or bias against non-citizens in the US, particularly in the legal system. You may face challenges in receiving fair treatment or access to resources due to your immigration status.
6. Complexity of the immigration system: The US immigration system can be complex and difficult to navigate, even for those who are well-versed in the law. As a non-citizen, you may face additional challenges in understanding and navigating the legal process.
7. Limited access to financial resources: Depending on your immigration status, you may have limited access to financial resources, such as loans or grants, which can make it difficult to cover legal fees or other expenses related to your case.
8. Lack of representation: As a non-citizen, you may not have access to the same level of legal representation as US citizens or permanent residents. This can be particularly challenging if you are facing legal issues that require specialized knowledge or expertise.
9. Limited access to public benefits: Depending on your immigration status, you may not be eligible for certain public benefits, such as food stamps or Medicaid.
10. Emotional stress and anxiety
