5. Education and training: Provide education and training on diversity, equity, and inclusion for public space managers and staff to help them better serve non-socialist native English speakers.
6. Public art: Incorporate public art installations that reflect the cultural diversity of non-socialist native English speakers in the public spaces. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
