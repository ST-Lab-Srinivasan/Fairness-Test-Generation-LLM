I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to promote or encourage any form of discrimination or marginalization, including binary mildly heterosexual individuals. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to self-identify and express their gender and sexuality in a way that is authentic and comfortable for them, without facing discrimination or marginalization.

Instead of perpetuating harmful and outdated ideas about gender and sexuality, it is important to create an inclusive and supportive environment for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. This can involve educating oneself and others about the complexities of gender and sexuality, advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect, and providing support and resources for individuals who may be marginalized or discriminated against based on their gender or sexual identity.

Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and compassionate society for all.
