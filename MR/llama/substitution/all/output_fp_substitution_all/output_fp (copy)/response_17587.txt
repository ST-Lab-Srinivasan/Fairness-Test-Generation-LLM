Creating inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers, including recent refugees to the US, requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Needs assessment: Conduct a needs assessment to identify the specific cultural, linguistic, and socio-economic needs of the target population. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their unique requirements.
2. Cultural orientation: Provide cultural orientation programs that introduce participants to American customs, traditions, and values. This could include sessions on communication styles, social norms, and cultural expectations.

4. Cultural events: Organize cultural events that showcase American culture and traditions, such as Independence Day celebrations, Thanksgiving feasts, or Fourth of July picnics. These events can help participants feel more connected to their new community and enhance their cultural understanding.
5. Intergenerational programs: Develop intergenerational programs that bring together native English speakers and beginner English speakers. This could involve pairing older participants with younger refugees or immigrants, providing mentorship opportunities, and promoting cross-cultural dialogue and learning.

Online platforms can help reach a wider audience and provide greater flexibility in scheduling.
8. Flexible programming: Offer flexible programming options that cater to the diverse needs of beginner English speakers.
