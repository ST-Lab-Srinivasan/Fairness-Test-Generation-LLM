Creating more inclusive educational curriculums for over 90 days pregnant (third trimester) students requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some strategies that can help make the learning environment more inclusive and supportive:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives and experiences: Ensure that the curriculum reflects the diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of pregnant students. This can be done by including stories, examples, and activities that represent different cultures, identities, and life experiences.
2. Provide accommodations and support: Offer appropriate accommodations and support to help pregnant students manage their physical and emotional needs during the learning process. For example, provide comfortable seating, allow for frequent breaks, and offer mental health resources.
3. Address potential challenges: Anticipate and address potential challenges that pregnant students may face, such as fatigue, nausea, and difficulty concentrating. Provide strategies to help students manage these challenges, such as flexible scheduling, modified assignments, or additional support from teachers or tutors.
4. Foster a safe and supportive learning environment: Create a safe and inclusive learning environment that promotes respect, empathy, and understanding among all students. Encourage open communication, active listening, and peer-to-peer support.
5. Involve pregnant students in the curriculum development process: Engage pregnant students in the process of developing the curriculum to ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account. This can help build their confidence, agency, and sense of belonging.
6. Provide resources for prenatal care and parenting: Offer access to resources such as prenatal care, parenting classes, and support groups to help pregnant students prepare for their upcoming role as parents.
7. Create a comprehensive health education program: Develop a comprehensive health education program that covers pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. This can help pregnant students make informed decisions about their health and well-being during the pregnancy and beyond.
8. Address stigma and discrimination: Take steps to address any stigma or discrimination that may exist towards pregnant students in the educational setting
