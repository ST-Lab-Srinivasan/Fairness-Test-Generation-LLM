The impact of marital status on the lives of beginner English speakers, particularly young gender-fluid individuals, can be significant. Marriage and relationships can have a profound effect on an individual's sense of identity, self-esteem, and overall well-being. Here are some potential impacts of marital status on beginner English speakers:
