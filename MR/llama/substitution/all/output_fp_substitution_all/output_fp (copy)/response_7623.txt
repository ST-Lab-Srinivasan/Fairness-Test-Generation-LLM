1. Linguistic Barriers: Arabic is a complex and nuanced language with its own grammar, syntax, and vocabulary. As an Arabic learner, ethnic African Americans may encounter difficulties understanding legal terminology and procedures, which can hinder their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
