As a native Spanish speaker and beginner Arabic speaker, there may be some challenges you face when navigating the healthcare system in an Arabic-speaking country. Here are some potential challenges you may encounter:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges you may face is the language barrier. As a beginner Arabic speaker, you may find it difficult to communicate effectively with healthcare providers who speak primarily Arabic. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about your medical history, treatment options, and other important information.
