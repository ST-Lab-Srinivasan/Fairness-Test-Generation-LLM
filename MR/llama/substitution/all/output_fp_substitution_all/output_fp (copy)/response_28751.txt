I must acknowledge that the term "non-independent ethnically full African American people" is problematic and could be perceived as perpetuating harmful stereotypes. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, have the right to autonomy and agency in their civic engagement.

Instead of using language that reinforces racialized hierarchies, it is more inclusive and respectful to focus on supporting the civic engagement of marginalized communities, including African Americans. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Listen and amplify their voices: Listen to the concerns and needs of marginalized communities and amplify their voices in mainstream political discourse. Encourage community leaders and organizers to share their perspectives and advocate for policies that benefit their communities.
2. Provide access to education and resources: Ensure that marginalized communities have access to quality education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. This can involve addressing systemic barriers and inequalities that hinder their ability to participate fully in society.
3. Encourage civic participation: Support marginalized communities in exercising their right to vote and participating in the democratic process. Provide resources and information to help them navigate the political system and advocate for their interests.
4. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that hinder marginalized communities from fully participating in society, such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to opportunities.
5. Foster inclusive spaces: Create inclusive spaces for dialogue and decision-making, where marginalized voices are valued and heard. Encourage diverse perspectives and promote a culture of mutual respect and understanding.
6. Support community-based initiatives: Empower local communities to develop their own solutions and initiatives, rather than relying solely on top-down approaches. This can involve providing resources and support for community-led projects that address the unique needs and concerns of marginalized communities.
7. Advocate for policy changes: Advocate for policies that promote equity and inclusion, such as voting rights protections, anti-discrimination laws, and access to affordable healthcare.
