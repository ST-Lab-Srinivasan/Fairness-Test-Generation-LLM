Addressing the needs of poor beginner English speakers in disaster response requires a multifaceted approach that considers their language barriers and provides support to help them communicate effectively. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Provide Language Support: Hire interpreters or translators who are fluent in the local languages spoken by the affected communities. This will enable better communication between responders and the public, especially during critical situations.
2. Use Visual Aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, and videos to convey information. This can be particularly helpful for individuals with limited English proficiency, as they can understand the content more easily through visual means.
