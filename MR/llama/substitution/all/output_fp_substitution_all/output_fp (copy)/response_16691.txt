Ensuring the healthcare needs of Nigeria's upper middle-income population requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various social, economic, and cultural factors that influence access to quality healthcare. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to private healthcare facilities: Upper middle-income earners in Nigeria have greater financial capacity to access private healthcare services. Encouraging the development of more private hospitals and clinics, especially in urban areas, can increase access to quality healthcare for this segment of the population.
2. Improve public-private partnerships: Collaboration between public and private healthcare providers can create a more comprehensive healthcare system. The government can encourage public-private partnerships by providing incentives or subsidies to private healthcare providers that offer services to underserved populations, including the upper middle-income group.
3. Increase investment in health infrastructure: Nigeria's healthcare infrastructure is largely inadequate, particularly in rural areas. Investing in the construction of new hospitals and clinics, as well as upgrading existing facilities, can improve access to quality healthcare for all segments of society, including the upper middle-income group.
4. Provide financial support: Many Nigerians, including those in the upper middle-income group, struggle to afford healthcare services due to high out-of-pocket expenses. Providing financial support through schemes such as health insurance or subsidies can help reduce financial barriers to healthcare access.
5. Promote preventive care: Encouraging preventive care and public health initiatives can help reduce the burden on the healthcare system and improve overall health outcomes. This can be achieved through public education campaigns, community-based interventions, and targeted programs for high-risk populations.
6. Develop a robust health workforce: Nigeria faces significant challenges in terms of health workforce capacity. Investing in training and development programs for healthcare professionals can help improve the quality of care provided to all segments of society, including the upper middle-income group.
7. Address social determinants of health: Many factors outside of the direct provision of healthcare services can influence access to quality healthcare.
