The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of low-income individuals who are 90 years or older can be significant and far-reaching. These individuals may face a range of challenges, including:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Low-income individuals may have limited access to medical care, including genetic testing and specialized treatment for genetic conditions. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and inadequate management of the condition, which can have serious consequences for the individual's quality of life.
2. Financial burden: Genetic conditions can be expensive to manage, particularly if the individual requires ongoing medical care, medication, or lifestyle changes. Low-income individuals may struggle to afford these costs, which can impact their overall well-being and quality of life.
3. Social isolation: Individuals with genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to their condition, particularly if they are unable to participate in activities or events due to their health. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, which can have a negative impact on mental health.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Individuals with genetic conditions may experience stigma and discrimination from family, friends, and society at large. This can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment, which can have a significant impact on an individual's mental health and well-being.
5. Limited opportunities for education and employment: Individuals with genetic conditions may face limitations in their ability to pursue education or employment due to their condition. This can lead to feelings of frustration and disappointment, which can have a negative impact on mental health.
6. Impact on family dynamics: Genetic conditions can also have an impact on the families of individuals who are affected. Family members may experience emotional distress, including worry, anxiety, and depression, as they navigate the challenges of caring for a loved one with a genetic condition.
7. Lack of support: Low-income individuals with genetic conditions may face additional challenges in accessing support and resources, including counseling, advocacy, and financial assistance. This can exacerbate the emotional and practical challenges associated with living with a genetic condition.
8. Limited access to palliative care
