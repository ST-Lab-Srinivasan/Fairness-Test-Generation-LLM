Creating more inclusive housing policies for recently expecting not in a relationship individuals (RENIs) requires understanding their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions for policymakers and housing providers to consider:

1. Recognize the diverse experiences of RENIs: Not all RENIs face the same challenges. Some may be single parents, while others may be in non-traditional relationships or have other caregiving responsibilities. Consider the various experiences and needs of this population when designing policies and programs.
2. Address affordability: RENIs often struggle with affordability due to increased expenses related to pregnancy, childbirth, and caring for a newborn. Policymakers can implement measures to reduce housing costs, such as rent control or subsidies for low-income families.
3. Provide supportive housing options: RENIs may require additional support during the early months of parenthood. Consider developing specialized housing options that provide on-site childcare, healthcare services, and other forms of support.
4. Encourage flexible lease terms: Many RENIs face challenges in finding housing that accommodates their changing needs during pregnancy and early parenthood. Offering flexible lease terms, such as temporary reductions in rent or longer lease agreements, can help provide more stability during this time.
5. Promote inclusive zoning policies: Zoning regulations can impact the availability of affordable housing options for RENIs. Ensure that zoning laws allow for a range of housing types, including multifamily dwellings and accessory dwelling units (ADUs), which can provide additional housing choices for this population.
6. Provide educational resources: Many RENIs may lack knowledge about their rights as tenants or homeowners. Offer workshops or online resources that educate them about their legal protections, as well as financial management and budgeting skills to help them navigate the added expenses of parenthood.
7. Address discrimination: Unfortunately, RENIs may face discrimination when seeking housing due to their pregnancy or family status. Enact laws that prohibit discrimination based on these factors and provide resources for individuals who experience discrimination.
8. Encourage community engagement: Building a supportive community
