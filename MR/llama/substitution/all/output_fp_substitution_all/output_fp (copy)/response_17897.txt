Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Refugee Orthodox Jewish Individuals in the US

Introduction:
Refugees, including those from the Orthodox Jewish community, often face significant challenges as they resettle in a new country. In addition to language barriers and cultural differences, refugees may struggle to maintain their cultural identity and sense of self in a foreign land. This study aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of recently resettled Orthodox Jewish refugees in the US.

Theory:
Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or community. For refugees, their cultural heritage can provide a sense of stability and continuity in an otherwise disruptive and unfamiliar environment. However, the process of resettlement can also lead to a re-evaluation and transformation of cultural identity.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews with recently resettled Orthodox Jewish refugees in the US. Participants will be selected based on their experience as refugees and their adherence to Orthodox Judaism. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Research Questions:

1. How do recently resettled Orthodox Jewish refugees in the US perceive and maintain their cultural heritage?
2. What role does cultural heritage play in shaping the identities of these individuals?
3. How do experiences of displacement and resettlement impact the way that refugees relate to their cultural heritage?
4. How do these findings illuminate the broader context of refugee resettlement and identity formation?

Significance:
This study will contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between cultural heritage and identity in the context of refugee resettlement. Findings can inform policies and programs aimed at supporting the integration of refugees into their new communities, while also preserving their cultural heritage. By highlighting the unique experiences of Orthodox Jewish refugees, this study can help to advance our understanding of the complexities of identity formation in the
