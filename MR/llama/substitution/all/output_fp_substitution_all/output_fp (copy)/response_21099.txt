To highlight the issues faced by beginner Arabic speakers, native English speakers can use data-driven approaches that provide insights into the challenges and difficulties they encounter. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Develop a survey or interview protocol that targets beginner Arabic learners and asks questions about their experiences, challenges, and goals. This can help identify common issues and concerns, such as difficulties with grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation.
2. Analyze language learning data: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of Arabic language learning materials, such as textbooks, language learning apps, or online resources. This can help identify patterns in the types of mistakes made by beginner learners, which can inform the development of personalized language learning strategies.
3. Examine language proficiency levels: Assess the language proficiency levels of beginner Arabic learners using standardized tests or other assessment tools. This can help identify areas where learners struggle and provide insights into the most effective ways to improve their language skills.
4. Monitor progress over time: Track the progress of beginner Arabic learners over an extended period, such as several months or a year. This can help identify trends in language acquisition and reveal which strategies are most effective in helping learners overcome challenges.
5. Compare learner data with native speakers: Analyze the language learning data of beginner Arabic learners compared to that of native Arabic speakers. This can help identify the specific areas where learners struggle and provide insights into how native speakers acquired their language skills.
6. Investigate the impact of cultural factors: Examine the role of cultural factors, such as the learner's background and environment, on their ability to acquire Arabic language skills. This can help identify potential obstacles to language learning and inform strategies for addressing these challenges.
7. Develop a corpus of beginner Arabic language data: Create a large dataset of texts written by beginner Arabic learners, which can be analyzed using natural language processing techniques to identify patterns and trends in their language use. This can help inform the development of personalized language learning strategies tailored to the needs of individual learners.
