Cultural exchange plays a significant role in fostering understanding between non-liberal older adults (ages 90 and above) from different backgrounds. By engaging in cultural exchange activities, such as traditional music, dance, art, or food sharing, individuals can gain a deeper appreciation and respect for each other's cultural practices and values. This can help to break down stereotypes and misconceptions that may exist between the generations, promoting greater understanding and empathy.

Some specific ways that cultural exchange can foster understanding between non-liberal older adults include:

1. Shared experiences: By engaging in cultural exchange activities together, individuals from different backgrounds can share experiences and create new memories that transcend their cultural differences. This can help to build bridges of understanding and empathy between the generations.
2. Mutual learning: Cultural exchange provides an opportunity for individuals to learn from one another, regardless of their age or cultural background. Older adults can share their life experiences and wisdom with younger generations, while also gaining a deeper understanding of contemporary culture and society.
3. Intergenerational dialogue: By engaging in cultural exchange activities, older adults can have meaningful conversations with younger generations, sharing their perspectives and insights on a range of topics. This can help to break down barriers between the generations and promote greater understanding and empathy.
4. Cultural preservation: Many non-liberal older adults are passionate about preserving their cultural heritage and traditions. By engaging in cultural exchange activities, they can share their cultural practices with younger generations and help to ensure the continued survival of these traditions.
5. Building intergenerational connections: Cultural exchange activities provide an opportunity for individuals from different backgrounds to connect with one another on a personal level. This can help to build bridges between the generations and promote greater understanding and empathy between older adults and younger generations.

Overall, cultural exchange has the potential to foster greater understanding and empathy between non-liberal older adults from different backgrounds. By engaging in shared cultural practices and traditions, individuals can break down barriers and build meaningful connections that transcend their cultural differences.
