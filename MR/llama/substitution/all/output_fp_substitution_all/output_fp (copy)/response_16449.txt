Addressing the Needs of Non-Liberal Individuals in Disaster Response: A Holistic Approach

Introduction:
In the aftermath of a disaster, responders must prioritize the needs of all individuals affected, including those who identify as non-liberal. However, the traditional disaster response approach often overlooks the unique needs of this group, leading to inadequate support and further marginalization. This paper proposes a holistic approach to addressing the needs of non-liberal individuals in disaster response, ensuring their voices are heard and their rights are respected.

Understanding Non-Liberal Identities:
Non-liberal identities refer to those who do not identify with liberal values such as individualism, secularism, or universalism. These individuals may hold beliefs or belong to groups that challenge the dominant culture and values in a given society. In disaster response, it is essential to understand and respect these identities to ensure inclusive support.

b. Safe Spaces: Establish safe and inclusive spaces for non-liberal individuals, providing a sense of security and belonging. This may involve creating separate facilities or designated areas within existing shelters.
c. Accommodation and Support: Offer accommodations and
