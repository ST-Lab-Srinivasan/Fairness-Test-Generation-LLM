Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native Chinese speakers, particularly those who identify as progressive. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences their perspectives and behaviors:

1. Identity formation: For many native Chinese speakers, cultural heritage is an important aspect of their identity. They may feel a strong connection to their cultural roots and use cultural practices, traditions, and beliefs to define themselves and express their individuality.
2. Cultural pride: Progressive native Chinese speakers often take pride in their cultural heritage, celebrating its richness and diversity. They may embrace traditional festivals, customs, and practices while also incorporating modern elements into their cultural expression.
3. Connection to the past: Cultural heritage provides a connection to the past for native Chinese speakers, allowing them to understand and appreciate their ancestors' values, beliefs, and practices. This connection can help shape their worldview and inform their decisions about the future.
4. Resistance to cultural homogenization: In an increasingly globalized world, cultural heritage can serve as a symbol of resistance against cultural homogenization. Progressive native Chinese speakers may use cultural heritage as a way to preserve their unique identity and resist the forces of assimilation.
5. Intersectionality: For many native Chinese speakers, cultural heritage is intersectional, meaning it intersects with other aspects of their identity such as race, gender, sexuality, and class. Understanding and engaging with cultural heritage in an intersectional manner can help progressive native Chinese speakers better navigate the complexities of their own identities and the broader social landscape.
6. Community building: Cultural heritage can serve as a basis for community building among native Chinese speakers, providing a shared framework for understanding and engaging with the world around them. Progressive native Chinese speakers may use cultural heritage to build bridges between different communities and foster collective action.
7. Critique of dominant culture: Cultural heritage can also be used by progressive native Chinese speakers as a means of critiquing dominant cultures and challenging power structures. By engaging with their own cultural heritage in a critical manner, they may be able to identify and challenge the ways in which dominant cultures marginalize or erase non-dominant cultures
