As an AI language model, I cannot generalize or stereotype any particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or nationality. However, I can provide some information on the challenges faced by extreme moderate independent native Chinese speakers in the legal system:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system (e.g., English in many countries), navigating legal procedures and documents can be particularly difficult. They may struggle to understand legal terminology, read court opinions, or communicate with legal professionals.
