Cultural competence is an essential skill for healthcare providers to effectively care for patients from diverse backgrounds. For beginner French speakers who are ethnically African American, cultural competence in healthcare can provide several benefits. Here are some of the key advantages:

1. Improved patient rapport and trust: When healthcare providers demonstrate an understanding of a patient's cultural beliefs and practices, it can help build rapport and trust between the provider and patient. This is particularly important for African American patients who may have had negative experiences with the medical system in the past.
2. More accurate diagnosis and treatment: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers identify and address cultural factors that may impact a patient's health. For example, some African American patients may be more likely to seek care from traditional healers or spiritual leaders before seeking medical attention.
