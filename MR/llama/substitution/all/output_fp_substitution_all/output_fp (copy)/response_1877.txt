Creating more inclusive public spaces for moderate native Spanish speakers involves understanding their needs and preferences, as well as addressing the systemic barriers that may exist. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive public spaces:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. This includes providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
2. Language Access: Provide interpreters or translated materials for individuals who may not speak the dominant language in the area. This can include translating signs, brochures, and other informational materials into the languages spoken by the local community.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural sensitivities and customs when designing public spaces. For example, consider the dress code requirements for a public park or library, and make sure they are inclusive of all cultures.
4. Inclusive Design: Incorporate design elements that are inclusive of all individuals, such as tactile features for individuals who are visually impaired, or seating areas with extra space for individuals who may need more room to move around.
5. Community Engagement: Engage with the local community to understand their needs and preferences when designing public spaces. This can involve conducting surveys, holding focus groups, or hosting community meetings to gather input from a diverse range of stakeholders.
6. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that is inclusive of all individuals, such as cultural events, art classes, or sports programs. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusion for all members of the community.
7. Collaboration: Collaborate with local organizations that serve moderate native Spanish speakers to ensure that public spaces are accessible and inclusive. This can involve working with community centers, schools, or other organizations to gather feedback and develop programming that meets the needs of this population.
8. Education and Awareness: Educate the broader community about the needs and preferences of moderate native Spanish speakers. This can involve hosting workshops, developing educational materials, or participating in outreach efforts to raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity in public spaces.
9. Technology: Utilize technology to improve accessibility and inclusivity in public spaces
