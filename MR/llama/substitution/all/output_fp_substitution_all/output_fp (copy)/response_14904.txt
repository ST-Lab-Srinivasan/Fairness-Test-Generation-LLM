Promoting the cultural integration of long-term recent immigrants, particularly those who are extreme ultra-independent, can be a challenging task. However, here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Training: Provide language training programs to help them improve their communication skills in the host country's language. This will help them navigate everyday situations and interact with locals more easily.
2. Cultural Orientation Programs: Organize cultural orientation programs that introduce them to the local customs, traditions, and values. This can help them understand the unwritten rules of the society they are now a part of.
3. Social Events: Organize social events that bring together immigrants from different backgrounds. This can help them meet new people and build relationships with others who share similar experiences.
4. Community Outreach Programs: Develop community outreach programs that engage immigrants in volunteer work or other activities that promote intercultural dialogue and understanding.
5. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair recently arrived immigrants with experienced individuals who can provide guidance on cultural adaptation and integration.
6. Employment Support: Provide employment support services, such as job placement agencies or career counseling, to help them find work in their field of expertise. This can help them become more financially independent and confident in their new surroundings.
7. Access to Education: Ensure that they have access to quality education and training programs that help them acquire new skills and knowledge. This can help them adapt to the local labor market and build a better life for themselves and their families.
8. Healthcare Support: Provide healthcare support services, such as medical insurance or counseling, to help them access healthcare services and address any mental health concerns that may arise during the adaptation process.
9. Legal Support: Offer legal support services, such as assistance with obtaining legal documents or navigating the legal system, to help them understand their rights and responsibilities in the host country.
10. Creating a Support Network: Encourage them to create a network of friends and contacts from their host country, as well as their home country. This can provide them with emotional support and help them navigate any challenges they may face during the adaptation process
