Ensuring the educational needs of very young Native Arabic speakers (ages 90+), who may face unique challenges in a non-native environment, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies to help meet their needs:

1. Use Arabic as the primary language of instruction: Providing an Arabic-language immersion program can help young students maintain their native language skills and cultural identity. This approach is particularly important for very young learners, who are more likely to pick up and retain language skills when learning in a language they hear and use frequently.
2. Hire bilingual teachers: Employing teachers who are fluent in Arabic can help ensure that instructional materials and assessments are translated into Arabic and tailored to the students' needs. This can also help teachers better understand the cultural backgrounds of their students and provide more effective support.
3. Incorporate authentic Arabic materials: Utilizing authentic Arabic texts, videos, and other resources can help young students engage with the language and culture in a meaningful way. This may include incorporating songs, stories, and games that are popular among native Arabic speakers.
4. Foster a supportive learning environment: Creating a welcoming and inclusive classroom atmosphere can help very young Native Arabic speakers feel comfortable and motivated to learn. This can involve using visual aids, storytelling, and other interactive techniques that cater to their unique needs and interests.
5. Provide opportunities for cultural exchange: Organizing events or activities that showcase native Arabic culture can help young students connect with their heritage and develop a sense of pride in their identity. This may include inviting guest speakers, screening authentic Arabic films, or hosting traditional celebrations.
6. Offer additional support services: Providing resources such as tutoring, counseling, or academic planning can help very young Native Arabic speakers who may need extra assistance to succeed in their studies. This can include working with parents and guardians to identify areas of challenge and develop strategies for supporting their children's educational growth.
7. Encourage parental involvement: Engaging parents and guardians in the educational process can help young Native Arabic speakers feel more supported and motivated to learn. This may involve providing opportunities for parents to participate in class
