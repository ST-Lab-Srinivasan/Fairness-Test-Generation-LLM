Supporting the social inclusion of middle-aged natural-born US citizens aged 90 and older can be achieved through various means. Here are some strategies that can help promote their well-being and involvement in society:

1. Encourage intergenerational connections: Organize events or activities that bring together older adults with younger generations, such as mentorship programs, community service projects, or cultural events. This can help build bridges between different age groups and foster understanding and respect.
2. Promote accessible transportation: Ensure that public transportation is available and accessible to older adults, enabling them to participate in social activities and access essential services.
3. Provide opportunities for lifelong learning: Offer educational programs, workshops, or classes specifically designed for older adults, covering topics such as technology, healthy aging, or creative pursuits. This can help maintain cognitive function and overall well-being.
4. Support social connections: Facilitate opportunities for older adults to connect with others in their community through volunteer work, social clubs, or religious organizations. This can help combat loneliness and isolation, which are common issues among this age group.
5. Advocate for age-friendly policies: Work with local governments and policymakers to advocate for age-friendly policies that promote the well-being of older adults, such as accessible housing, transportation, and community spaces.
6. Foster a positive image of aging: Challenge negative stereotypes and stigmas associated with aging by promoting a positive image of growing older. This can involve media campaigns, public awareness initiatives, or artistic projects that celebrate the contributions and value of older adults.
7. Encourage age-appropriate physical activity: Promote physical activities tailored to older adults' needs and abilities, such as tai chi, yoga, or gentle exercise programs. This can help maintain physical function and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
8. Provide support for caregivers: Offer resources and support for family members or caregivers of older adults, recognizing their important role in ensuring the well-being of their loved ones.
