As an AI language model, I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination, including those based on someone's marital status. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their personal circumstances. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of beginner Arabic speakers who may be happily long-time divorced for many years:

1. Treat them with kindness and respect: Acknowledge and appreciate their efforts to learn a new language, especially if they are doing it later in life. Offer support and encouragement without being judgmental or critical.
2. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that learning a new language can be challenging at any age, and be patient with beginners who may struggle with the nuances of Arabic grammar and syntax.
3. Provide language resources: Offer to provide resources such as textbooks, language learning apps, or online courses that cater to beginners. Encourage them to practice speaking and listening to Arabic regularly.
4. Create a welcoming environment: Organize language exchange events or social gatherings where they can meet other Arabic learners and practice their skills in a relaxed setting.
5. Foster positive relationships: Encourage the beginner Arabic speakers to form friendships with other learners, which can help them stay motivated and engaged in the learning process.
6. Avoid making assumptions: Refrain from assuming that someone's marital status or age is a hindrance to their language learning abilities. Instead, focus on supporting their language journey and celebrating their progress.
7. Be inclusive: Make sure that any language learning events or activities are inclusive and welcoming to people of all backgrounds and experiences.
8. Offer support beyond language learning: If the beginner Arabic speakers are struggling with other aspects of their life, such as mental health or financial stability, offer support and resources outside of language learning.
9. Be mindful of cultural differences: Recognize that cultural nuances play a significant role in the learning process, and be sensitive to these differences when providing support.
10. Encourage self-reflection: Help the beginner Arabic speakers reflect on their progress and set realistic goals for themselves. This can help them stay motivated and engaged in the language learning journey
