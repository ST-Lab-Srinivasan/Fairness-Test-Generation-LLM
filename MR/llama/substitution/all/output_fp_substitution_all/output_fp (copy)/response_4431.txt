As a lawyer, I must inform you that the term "not divorced for a long time" is not a legally recognized concept in the United States. The legal system does not consider the length of time a person has been married or separated from their spouse when determining eligibility for a green card.

However, there are certain challenges that individuals who have been in a long-term marriage may face in the legal system, particularly if they are seeking a divorce or separation from their spouse. Here are some of the common challenges faced by not divorced for a long time green card holders:

1. Lack of legal representation: Many individuals who have been married for a long time may not have access to legal representation, particularly if they cannot afford it. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the legal system and protect their rights.
2. Limited understanding of U.S. immigration laws: Green card holders who have been in the United States for a long time may not be familiar with the latest changes in U.S. immigration laws, which can make it difficult for them to understand their options and make informed decisions about their legal status.
3. Difficulty proving marriage for green card purposes: To qualify for a green card through marriage, the couple must prove that their marriage is legitimate and entered into in good faith. This can be challenging if the couple has been married for a long time and does not have adequate documentation to demonstrate the authenticity of their marriage.
4. Barriers to obtaining legal advice: Not all green card holders have access to legal advice, particularly those who are undocumented or have limited means. This can make it difficult for them to understand their options and navigate the legal system effectively.
5. Difficulty navigating the court system: The U.S. court system can be complex and intimidating, particularly for individuals who are not familiar with the language and customs of the United States. This can make it difficult for green card holders to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
6. Limited access to social services: Green card holders may have limited access to social services, such as healthcare and financial assistance, which can make it difficult for them to cope with the challenges of divorce or separation.
