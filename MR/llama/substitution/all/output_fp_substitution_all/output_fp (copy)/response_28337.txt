To highlight the issues faced by non-upper-class beginner Chinese speaker individuals, you can use data in the following ways:

1. Analyze language learning resources: Conduct a content analysis of language learning resources such as textbooks, apps, and online courses to identify any biases or lack of representation of diverse learners. For example, how many resources are specifically tailored for non-native speakers from low socio-economic backgrounds? How many resources are available in different formats (e.g., audio, visual, written) to accommodate various learning styles?
2. Survey beginner learners: Conduct a survey of beginner Chinese language learners to gather data on their demographics, learning goals, and challenges. This can help identify the specific issues faced by non-upper-class individuals, such as lack of access to resources, limited exposure to spoken Chinese, or difficulties with tones and pronunciation.
3. Analyze language proficiency tests: Examine the results of language proficiency tests for beginner learners, including their scores and performance in different areas (e.g., listening, speaking, reading, writing). This can help identify any disparities in language proficiency levels between non-upper-class and upper-class individuals.

For example, do teachers provide sufficient support and feedback to struggling learners? Are resources available for learners with different learning styles or needs?
5. Compare language learning outcomes: Analyze the language learning outcomes of non-upper-class and upper-class learners to identify any gaps in achievement. This could involve comparing their proficiency levels, pass rates, or other measures of language proficiency.
6. Map the learning journey: Create a visual representation of the language learning journey for non-upper-class beginner learners, highlighting the challenges and obstacles they face at each stage. This can help identify potential areas for intervention and support.
7. Investigate the role of social and economic factors: Examine the impact of social and economic factors on the language learning process for non-upper-class individuals. For example, how do factors such as income, education level,
