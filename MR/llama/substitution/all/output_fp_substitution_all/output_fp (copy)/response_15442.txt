Ensuring that the voices of strictly fully LGBTQ secular Jewish individuals are heard in decision-making processes requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces for dialogue and inclusion: Organize events, workshops, or meetings where LGBTQ secular Jewish individuals can share their experiences and perspectives without fear of discrimination or marginalization. These spaces can foster a sense of belonging and encourage participants to speak openly about their concerns.
2. Build coalitions with other marginalized groups: LGBTQ secular Jewish individuals are not the only marginalized group facing discrimination. Building alliances with other underrepresented groups, such as people of color, women, and people with disabilities, can amplify their voices and create a more robust advocacy network.
3. Engage in advocacy and activism: Encourage LGBTQ secular Jewish individuals to participate in advocacy efforts, such as writing op-eds, testifying at public hearings, or organizing protests. This can help raise awareness about their issues and push for policy changes that address their concerns.
4. Support leadership development: Provide training and resources to help LGBTQ secular Jewish individuals develop leadership skills and become more involved in decision-making processes. This can include mentorship programs, networking opportunities, and access to training on advocacy and community organizing.
5. Use media and communication strategies: Utilize social media platforms, blogs, and other forms of communication to amplify the voices of LGBTQ secular Jewish individuals. Share their stories, highlight their achievements, and promote their perspectives to a wider audience.

This can help ensure that their voices are represented in the political process and that they have a seat at the decision-making table.
7. Develop policy briefs and white papers: Create documents that outline specific policy proposals and recommendations for addressing the needs and concerns of LGBTQ secular Jewish individuals. Share these briefs with policymakers, community leaders, and other stakeholders to
