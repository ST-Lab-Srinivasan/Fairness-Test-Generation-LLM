The legal system in Nigeria can be challenging for individuals who are not wealthy or millionaires, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or social status. Here are some of the common challenges faced by non-wealthy multimillionaire Nigerians in the legal system:

1. Limited access to legal representation: Many non-wealthy Nigerians may not be able to afford legal representation, which can limit their ability to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
2. Lack of knowledge about the legal system: The legal system in Nigeria can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. Non-wealthy individuals may struggle to understand the laws and procedures that govern the legal system.

4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against non-wealthy individuals is still prevalent in the Nigerian legal system. Wealthier individuals may be given preferential treatment in court, while non-wealthy individuals may face more obstacles and challenges.
5. Lack of political influence: Non-wealthy individuals may not have the same level of political influence as wealthier individuals, which can make it harder for them to effect change in the legal system or to advocate for their rights.
6. Limited access to justice: The legal system in Nigeria is not always accessible to non-wealthy individuals, particularly when it comes to cases that require significant resources, such as intellectual property disputes or complex commercial litigation.
7. Corruption: Unfortunately, corruption is still a significant issue in the Nigerian legal system, and non-wealthy individuals may face more obstacles and challenges due to this problem.
8. Lack of transparency and accountability: The lack of transparency and accountability in the legal system can make it difficult for non-wealthy individuals to hold those in power accountable for any wrongdoing or abuse of power.
9. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Non-wealthy individuals may not have access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as mediation
