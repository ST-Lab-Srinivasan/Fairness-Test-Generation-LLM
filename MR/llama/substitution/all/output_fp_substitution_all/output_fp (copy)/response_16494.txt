Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mixed African American agnostic individuals requires understanding and respecting their identities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge and validate their identity: Mixed race individuals often feel marginalized or erased in cultural celebrations that do not acknowledge their multifaceted identity. Make sure to include them in the celebration by recognizing and valuing their unique perspective.
2. Be mindful of religious and cultural appropriation: Be sensitive to the beliefs and practices of mixed race individuals who may identify as agnostic or have a different spiritual background than the dominant culture. Avoid using religious or cultural symbols that are sacred to them without proper understanding or permission.
3. Incorporate diverse representation: Ensure that the celebration reflects the diversity of the community by including individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, as well as those who identify as LGBTQ+, gender non-conforming, or have disabilities.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where all individuals feel welcome and included. Encourage mixed race individuals to share their experiences and perspectives, and listen to their stories without judgment.
5. Offer inclusive activities: Provide activities that cater to the diverse needs and interests of the community, such as cultural workshops, art exhibitions, or music performances that showcase a range of musical styles.
6. Provide accessible spaces: Ensure that the celebration venue is accessible to individuals with disabilities and offers accommodations for their needs.
7. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the history and experiences of mixed race communities, and share this knowledge with others to promote understanding and empathy.
8. Encourage intergenerational dialogue: Facilitate conversations between older generations and younger ones, to ensure that the celebration is inclusive of different perspectives and experiences.
9. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and respectful environment where individuals can express themselves freely without fear of discrimination or marginalization.
10. Be flexible and adaptable: Be open to adjusting your plans based on the needs and preferences of the community, and be willing to make changes as needed to ensure everyone feels included.
