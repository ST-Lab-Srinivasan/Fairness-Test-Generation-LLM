The role of family support in the success of financially disadvantaged nominal Christian individuals is significant. Financial difficulties can be particularly challenging for those who are already struggling with poverty, and the lack of financial resources can have a profound impact on their overall well-being and quality of life. However, research suggests that family support can play a crucial role in mitigating the negative effects of poverty and improving the well-being of financially disadvantaged individuals.

Firstly, family support can provide emotional and social support to individuals who are experiencing financial difficulties. Studies have shown that individuals who have strong social support networks tend to experience better mental health outcomes and lower levels of stress compared to those without such support (Cohen et al., 2015). Emotional support from family members can help individuals cope with the emotional burden of poverty, which can be particularly challenging in nominal Christian communities where financial struggles may be seen as a personal failing rather than a systemic issue.

Secondly, family support can provide practical assistance to individuals who are struggling financially. For example, family members may offer financial assistance, share resources, or help with household tasks to reduce the individual's workload (Kim et al., 2016). This type of support can be particularly important in communities where there may be limited access to social services or resources.

Thirdly, family support can play a role in promoting resilience and hope among financially disadvantaged individuals. Research has shown that individuals who have a strong sense of hope and resilience tend to experience better mental health outcomes and are more likely to overcome financial challenges (Lambert et al., 2014). Family support can help foster a sense of hope and resilience by providing emotional support, encouraging goal-setting, and promoting a positive outlook on the future.

However, it is important to note that family support alone may not be sufficient to overcome financial difficulties. Financial struggles often have complex underlying causes, such as lack of access to education or job opportunities, discrimination, or systemic inequality (Kirchgaessner et al., 2015). Addressing these underlying issues requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond family support and involves policy
