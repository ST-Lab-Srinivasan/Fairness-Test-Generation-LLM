Introduction:
Marriage and gender identity have long been intertwined in many cultures, with marriage being seen as a central aspect of adult life.

Theories of Marriage and Gender Identity:
Marriage has long been seen as a central aspect of adult life, with many cultures placing great emphasis on the institution. However, in recent years, there has been a shift towards greater gender equality and recognition of non-binary identities. For native French speakers who identify as cisgender or transgender, their marital status can have significant impacts on their lives.

Impact of Marital Status on Cisgender Individuals:
For native French speakers who identify as cisgender, their marital status can have a significant impact on their lives.
