Introduction:
Marriage and romantic relationships can have a significant impact on an individual's life, especially for beginner French speakers. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner French speaker masculine individuals. Specifically, this study will examine how marriage and romantic relationships affect the language learning process, cultural integration, and overall well-being of beginner French speakers.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage and romantic relationships can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On one hand, marriage can provide a sense of stability and security, which can enhance language learning and cultural integration (Garcia & Hood, 2013). On the other hand, romantic relationships can be a source of stress and anxiety, which can hinder language learning and cultural adaptation (Kim et al., 2016).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, with data collected through in-depth interviews with beginner French speakers. Participants will be recruited through online language learning communities and social media platforms. The sample will consist of 20 participants, aged 18-35 years old, who are currently in a romantic relationship or married.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from the interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The themes that emerge from the data will be related to the impact of marital status on language learning and cultural integration. These themes may include factors such as social support, motivation, and emotional well-being.

Expected Findings:
The findings of this study are expected to provide insights into the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner French speaker masculine individuals. Specifically, the study will shed light on how marriage and romantic relationships affect language learning, cultural integration, and overall well-being. The results may also reveal differences in the experiences of married and unmarried participants, as well as the impact of different types of relationships (e.g., long-term vs. short-term) on language learning and cultural adaptation.

Conclusion:
This study aims to contribute to our understanding of the impacts of marital status on the lives of
