Creating more inclusive community programs for active-duty formerly long-time single individuals can be achieved through a combination of understanding their unique needs and preferences, and designing programs that cater to those needs. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the challenges faced by single individuals: Active-duty service members who have been single for an extended period may face different challenges than their peers in heterosexual relationships. They may struggle with social isolation, loneliness, and feelings of disconnection from their peers and community.
2. Offer flexible programming options: Provide programming that can accommodate the unpredictable schedules of service members, such as spouse support groups, childcare services, or activities that can be done independently.
3. Create spaces for socialization: Develop safe and welcoming spaces where single service members can connect with others who share similar experiences. This could include online communities, in-person events, or recreational activities.
4. Address mental health concerns: Provide access to mental health resources and support groups specifically designed for single service members. This may include counseling services, stress management workshops, or peer support groups.
5. Promote self-care: Encourage single service members to prioritize their own well-being through self-care activities such as exercise, mindfulness practices, or creative pursuits.
6. Offer career development opportunities: Provide resources and support for single service members to advance their careers or explore new professional paths.
7. Advocate for policy changes: Work with organizations and policymakers to advocate for policies that support the needs of single service members, such as flexible work arrangements or family-friendly benefits.
8. Engage with influencers and role models: Connect single service members with influential individuals who have overcome similar challenges, such as successful entrepreneurs, artists, or military leaders.
9. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms to connect single service members with one another and with resources, including online support groups, mentorship programs, or social media communities.
10. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for single service members to feel included and valued within their military community, such as through cultural events, volunteer activities, or community service projects.
