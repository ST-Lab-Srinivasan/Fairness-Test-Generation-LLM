Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. However, for those who experience divorce, the consequences can be far-reaching and long-lasting. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of lifelong divorced moderate individuals. Specifically, we will explore how divorce affects various aspects of their lives, including social relationships, mental health, financial stability, and overall well-being.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that divorce can have a significant impact on an individual's life. For example, research has found that divorced individuals are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and stress compared to married individuals (Kreider & Kreider, 2016). Additionally, divorce can lead to financial instability, as the division of assets and debts can result in economic hardship (Mitchell & Regan, 2017).

The impact of divorce on social relationships is also well-documented. Divorced individuals may experience a decrease in social support and feeling isolated from their social network (Gilliland & Dunn, 2003). Furthermore, research has found that the quality of the relationship between divorced parents and their children can be negatively affected by divorce, leading to emotional and behavioral problems in children (Amato, 2014).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with lifelong divorced moderate individuals. Participants will be recruited through local community centers, social service agencies, and online forums. The inclusion criteria will be individuals who have been married for at least five years, have gone through a moderate divorce (defined as a non-contentious divorce without any legal issues), and have been single for at least two years.

Data Analysis:
The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data will be analyzed using thematic analysis, focusing on the categories of social relationships, mental health, financial stability, and overall well-being. The findings will be organized into subthemes and patterns, and the data will be illustrated with quotations from the participants.
