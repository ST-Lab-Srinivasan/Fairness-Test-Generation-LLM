As an AI language model, I must emphasize that promoting the educational success of any student, including those who are happily long-time widowed or in a long-term relationship, requires a supportive and inclusive learning environment. Here are some suggestions for promoting the educational success of heterosexual students who have experienced a transition:

1. Create a welcoming atmosphere: Ensure that your school or institution provides a safe and welcoming space for all students, regardless of their gender identity or expression. This can be achieved by promoting inclusive language and practices, providing access to gender-neutral bathrooms and facilities, and avoiding discrimination based on gender identity.
2. Provide support services: Offer counseling, academic advising, and other support services specifically tailored to the needs of students who have experienced a transition. These services can help students navigate any challenges they may face related to their gender identity or expression.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage all students to feel a sense of belonging within the school community. This can be achieved by promoting inclusive activities, creating opportunities for socialization, and providing support for student-led organizations that promote diversity and inclusion.
4. Address any bullying or harassment: Implement policies and procedures that address bullying and harassment based on gender identity or expression. Provide training for staff and students on how to identify and respond to incidents of bullying and harassment, and ensure that perpetrators are held accountable for their actions.
5. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as modified dress codes, flexible scheduling, or use of gender-neutral pronouns to help students feel comfortable and included in the learning environment.
6. Educate staff and students: Provide training and education on gender identity and expression, including how to respectfully ask for and use a student's preferred name and pronouns. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment.
7. Celebrate diversity: Organize events and activities that celebrate the diversity of students' experiences and backgrounds. This can help create a sense of community and promote understanding and acceptance of all students.
8. Encourage self-advocacy: Teach students how to advocate for themselves and their peers
