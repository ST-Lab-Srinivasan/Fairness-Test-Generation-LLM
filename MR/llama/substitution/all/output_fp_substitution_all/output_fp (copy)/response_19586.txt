Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting very middle-aged (90s+) non-conservative communities. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can help:

1. Social Connection: Volunteering provides an opportunity for older adults to connect with others in their community, which is essential for mental and emotional well-being. Non-conservative communities may face isolation or discrimination, making it even more important for them to have access to social connections.
2. Skill Sharing: Many older adults have extensive experience and knowledge that can be shared with others. Volunteering provides an opportunity for them to pass on their skills and wisdom to younger generations, preserving cultural heritage and tradition.
3. Community Engagement: Volunteering helps to foster a sense of community and belonging among older adults. It provides an opportunity for them to participate in activities that benefit the wider community, such as volunteering at local food banks or organizing community events.
4. Health Benefits: Studies have shown that volunteering has numerous health benefits for older adults, including reduced risk of depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. It can also help to improve physical health by providing opportunities for exercise and social interaction.
5. Personal Fulfillment: Volunteering can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment for older adults, helping them to feel valued and appreciated. It can also give them a sense of identity and belonging, which is essential for mental well-being.
6. Intergenerational Relationships: Volunteering provides an opportunity for older adults to form relationships with younger generations, promoting intergenerational connections and understanding. This can help to break down barriers and stereotypes between different age groups.
7. Cultural Preservation: Non-conservative communities may have unique cultural practices or traditions that are at risk of being lost over time. Volunteering provides an opportunity for older adults to preserve these cultural practices by sharing them with younger generations.
8. Advocacy: Older adults can use their volunteering experiences to advocate for issues that matter to their community. For example, they may work to raise awareness about social justice issues or advocate for policies that benefit their community.
9. Leadership Opportunities
