5. Internalized oppression: Disabled individuals may internalize negative attitudes and messages about their disability, leading to self-doubt, low self-esteem, and feelings of shame or guilt.
6. Isolation and social exclusion: Non-disabled people may avoid interacting with disabled individuals, leading to social isolation and a lack of inclusion in social activities and events.
7. Healthcare disparities: Disabled individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to ableism and discrimination within the medical profession.
8. Education challenges: Non-disabled students may not receive adequate education on disability issues, leading to a lack of understanding and empathy towards disabled peers.
