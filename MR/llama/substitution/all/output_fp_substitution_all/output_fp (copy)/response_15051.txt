Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for Native American recent green card holders to the US and nominal Christian individuals requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve Native American communities in the planning process: Consult with local Native American communities and organizations to ensure that their traditions and beliefs are represented and respected. This can involve incorporating traditional music, dance, and art into the celebrations.
2. Provide educational opportunities: Offer workshops or events that provide information about Native American cultures, histories, and traditions. This can help non-Native individuals better understand and appreciate the cultural significance of these celebrations.
3. Foster cross-cultural exchange: Encourage dialogue and collaboration between Native American and non-Native communities. This can involve organizing joint events or activities that promote mutual understanding and respect.
4. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Avoid using Native American cultural elements in a way that is disrespectful or culturally insensitive. For example, avoid using traditional Native American clothing or imagery as a costume or decoration without proper permission or context.
5. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Encourage the participation of individuals from different cultural backgrounds in the planning and execution of cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that the events are inclusive and representative of the diversity of the community.
6. Be open to feedback and criticism: Be willing to listen to and learn from feedback and criticism from Native American communities and other stakeholders. This can involve being receptive to constructive criticism and making changes to ensure that cultural celebrations are more inclusive and respectful.
7. Support local Native American businesses: Encourage the use of local Native American-owned businesses for supplies, decorations, and other event materials. This can help support the local economy and promote cultural exchange.
8. Create a safe space: Ensure that cultural celebrations are welcoming and inclusive for all participants, regardless of their cultural background. This can involve providing a safe and respectful environment for individuals to share their traditions and beliefs.
9. Provide interpretation and translation services: Offer interpretation and translation services during cultural celebrations to ensure that all participants can fully engage and understand the events.
