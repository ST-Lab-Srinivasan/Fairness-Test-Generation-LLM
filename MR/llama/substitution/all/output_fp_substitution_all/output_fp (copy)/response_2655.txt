3. Foster a safe space for expression: Create a safe and welcoming environment where all students can express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be achieved by promoting open communication, empathy, and mutual respect among students.
4. Provide mental health resources: Ensure that there are adequate mental health resources available to support the well-being of all students, including those who may be struggling with issues related to their gender identity or expression.
