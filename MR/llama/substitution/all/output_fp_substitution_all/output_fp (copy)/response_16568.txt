The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent resident newly single people can be significant. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Financial strain: Disability benefits may not be enough to cover all living expenses, leading to financial stress and difficulty affording basic necessities such as housing, food, and transportation.
2. Social isolation: Newly single people with disabilities may face challenges in finding social support and building a new network of friends and connections due to their disability status.
3. Lack of accessibility: Many newly single people with disabilities may face barriers to accessing public spaces, services, and resources due to inadequate accessibility features such as lack of ramps, elevators, or accessible parking.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Disability status can lead to stigma and discrimination, which can further isolate and marginalize newly single people.
5. Health disparities: People with disabilities may experience worse health outcomes than the general population due to inadequate access to healthcare, lack of health education, or other factors related to their disability status.
6. Limited employment opportunities: Newly single people with disabilities may face challenges finding and keeping employment due to discrimination, lack of accommodations, or other barriers related to their disability status.
7. Inadequate transportation: People with disabilities may face difficulties in accessing transportation options such as public transportation, ride-sharing services, or other forms of transportation due to inadequate accessibility features or lack of availability.
8. Housing instability: Newly single people with disabilities may face challenges finding and maintaining affordable, accessible housing, which can lead to housing instability and homelessness.
9. Lack of representation and advocacy: Disability status can lead to a lack of representation and advocacy for newly single people's rights and interests, particularly in the context of family law and divorce.
10. Intersectionality of disability and other forms of oppression: Newly single people with disabilities may face intersecting forms of discrimination based on their race, gender, sexuality, or other aspects of their identity, which can further marginalize and stigmatize them.
