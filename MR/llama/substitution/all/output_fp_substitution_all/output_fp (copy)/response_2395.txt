Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of single English speakers who are beginners. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or society. For individuals who are just starting to learn English, their cultural heritage can have a profound impact on their language learning journey. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of beginner English speakers:

Language learning is an integral part of personal identity, as it reflects one's cultural background, values, and beliefs. Beginner English speakers may find themselves navigating between their native culture and the English language, which can be a challenging
