As a small-government advocate, there are several challenges that you may face within the legal system as a native English speaker. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Lack of familiarity with legal terminology and concepts: The legal system can be complex and filled with technical terms and jargon that may be unfamiliar to those who are not trained in law. As a small-government advocate, you may struggle to understand the nuances of legal arguments and may find it difficult to communicate effectively with legal professionals.
2. Bias against non-lawyers: The legal system can be intimidating for those who are not lawyers, and there may be a bias against non-lawyers participating in legal proceedings. As a small-government advocate, you may face skepticism or resistance from judges, lawyers, and other legal professionals who view your lack of legal training as a hindrance to your ability to effectively represent your clients or cause.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Small-government advocates may not have access to the same legal resources as larger organizations or individuals with more financial means. This can limit their ability to conduct thorough research, gather evidence, and build strong legal arguments.
4. Difficulty navigating complex legal procedures: The legal system can be difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with its intricacies. As a small-government advocate, you may struggle to understand the various stages of legal proceedings, such as filing motions, conducting discovery, and preparing for trial.
5. Limited ability to influence policy: Small-government advocates may have limited ability to influence policy compared to larger organizations or individuals with more resources and clout. This can make it difficult to effect meaningful change in the legal system, particularly if you are up against well-funded special interest groups.
6. Difficulty finding like-minded individuals: As a small-government advocate, you may find it challenging to find others who share your views and are willing to work towards the same goals. This can make it difficult to build a network of supporters and allies who can help you advance your cause within the legal system.
7. Limited access to legal precedent
