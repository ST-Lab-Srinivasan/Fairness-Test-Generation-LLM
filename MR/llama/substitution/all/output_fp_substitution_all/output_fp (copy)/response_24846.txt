By influencing policy change, volunteers can help create a more equitable society.
4. Education and Awareness: Volunteers can help raise awareness about poverty and its effects through public outreach and education campaigns. This may involve organizing events, creating educational materials, or using social media to amplify the voices of those living in poverty. By increasing understanding and empathy, volunteers can help build a more supportive community.
5. Economic Empowerment: Volunteers can work with local organizations to provide economic opportunities for individuals and families living in poverty.
