Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's emotional, social, and financial well-being. However, when a marriage ends in divorce, it can lead to a range of negative consequences, particularly for conservative individuals who may struggle with the stigma of being single again. This study examines the impacts of marital status on the lives of long-term recently divorced conservative individuals and explores how their experiences differ from those of other groups.

Methods:
This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews to collect data from 20 long-term recently divorced conservative individuals. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
Four main themes emerged from the data: (1) Social Isolation, (2) Financial Stress, (3) Emotional Distress, and (4) Identity Crisis. The findings indicate that long-term recently divorced conservative individuals experience significant challenges in their social lives, including loss of social support networks and difficulties adapting to single life. Financial strain was also a major concern, particularly for those who had relied on their partner's income during the marriage. Emotional distress was a common experience, with participants struggling to come to terms with the end of their marriage and the loss of their partnership. Finally, many participants reported feeling adrift in their identity, struggling to reconcile their previous roles as married individuals with their new single status.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study highlight the unique challenges faced by long-term recently divorced conservative individuals. These challenges are compounded by societal expectations and norms around marriage and gender roles, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation, financial strain, emotional distress, and identity crisis. It is important to recognize the impact of marital status on these individuals and provide appropriate support and resources to help them navigate this difficult life transition.

Recommendations:
1. Provide access to counseling services specifically tailored to the needs of long-term recently divorced conservative individuals.
2. Offer financial planning workshops and resources to
