Title: The Impact of Military Status on Beginner Chinese Speaker Conservative Individuals

Introduction:

The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is a significant institution in China, with a long history and a crucial role in the country's politics and society. As the PLA has become more prominent in recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding its impact on various groups within Chinese society. This paper examines the impact of military status on beginner Chinese speaker conservative individuals, focusing on their language learning experiences, cultural interactions, and personal growth.

Literature Review:

Previous studies have shown that military service can have a profound impact on an individual's life, particularly during the formative years of adulthood (Liu & Li, 2015). For conservative individuals who are beginning to learn Chinese, their military status may affect their motivations, attitudes, and behaviors in various ways.

Motivation:

Research has shown that military service can be a significant motivator for some individuals, particularly those from lower socio-economic backgrounds (Zhang & Liu, 2016). For conservative beginner Chinese speakers, their military status may provide additional motivation to learn the language and culture of China, as they see it as an opportunity to gain a strategic advantage in their career or personal life.

Attitudes:

Military service can also shape an individual's attitudes towards different cultures and societies (Tang & Zhang, 2017). Beginner Chinese speaker conservatives may have preconceived notions about China and its culture, which can affect their language learning experiences. Their military status may influence their perception of the PLA and its role in Chinese society, potentially leading to biased interpretations of cultural practices and values.

Behaviors:

The military environment can have a profound impact on an individual's behavior and interactions with others (Chen & Zhang, 2018). Beginner Chinese speaker conservatives may adopt certain behaviors and habits while in the military, such as discipline, teamwork, and respect for authority. These traits can transfer to their language learning experiences, enabling them to better navigate complex cultural situations and interact with native speakers.
