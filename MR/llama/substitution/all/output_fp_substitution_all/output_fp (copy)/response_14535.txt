Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers who are not disabled people. Here are some possible impacts:

1. Access to resources: In China, the government provides various resources and support for language learners, such as language learning apps, tutors, and study materials. However, these resources may be more accessible to those with a certain political affiliation, such as members of the Communist Party or those who have shown loyalty to the government. This can create an uneven playing field for beginner Chinese speakers who are not affiliated with the government.
2. Job opportunities: In China, having a certain political affiliation can open up job opportunities that may not be available to those without it. For example, government agencies and state-owned enterprises often prioritize hiring candidates with a strong political background. This can limit the job prospects of beginner Chinese speakers who are not affiliated with the government.
3. Social mobility: In China, social mobility is often linked to political affiliation. Those with a strong political background may have greater access to educational and career opportunities, which can make it more difficult for beginner Chinese speakers who are not affiliated with the government to climb the social ladder.

Having a certain political affiliation can provide access to a network of influential people and opportunities that may not be available to those without it. This can give beginner Chinese speakers who are not affiliated with the government a disadvantage in terms of career advancement.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against those without a certain political affiliation is still prevalent in China. Beginner Chinese speakers who are not members of the Communist Party or do not show loyalty to the government may face discrimination in various aspects of life, including employment, education, and social interactions.
