Creating more inclusive community events for Native Arabic speakers who are not from upper-middle-income backgrounds requires careful planning, consideration of their needs, and tailored strategies to ensure their participation. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify the needs of the target audience: Understand the specific challenges and barriers that prevent Native Arabic speakers from participating in community events. This could include language barriers, cultural differences, lack of accessibility, or financial constraints.
2. Provide free or low-cost events: Offering free or low-cost events can make them more accessible to a wider range of people, including those who may not have the financial means to attend more expensive events.
3. Offer childcare and translation services: Providing childcare and translation services can help reduce the burden on families and ensure that everyone can participate fully in the event.
4. Promote the event through multiple channels: Use various communication channels, such as social media, flyers, posters, and word of mouth, to reach a wider audience. This can help ensure that Native Arabic speakers are aware of the event and feel included.
5. Involve the community in the planning process: Involving Native Arabic speakers in the planning and organizing process can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account. This can also help build trust and inclusivity within the community.
6. Offer culturally appropriate food and activities: Providing food and activities that are culturally relevant to Native Arabic speakers can help create a more welcoming environment.
