The impact of military status on the lives of lifelong, recently married, and advanced individuals aged 65 or older (and over 85) can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Health Impacts: Military service can have a lasting impact on physical health, particularly for those who served in combat zones or were exposed to hazardous materials during their military service. Chronic conditions such as PTSD, TBI, and other mental and physical health issues may develop later in life, affecting the individual's quality of life and ability to perform daily tasks.
2. Financial Impacts: Military service can provide financial benefits such as retirement pensions, health insurance, and education assistance. However, these benefits may not be sufficient to cover all living expenses, particularly for those who are over 85 years old and have limited earning potential. Additionally, military spouses may face challenges in accessing their own benefits due to their marital status or the lack of support from veterans' organizations.
3. Social Isolation: Military service can lead to social isolation, particularly for those who served in combat zones or were stationed far away from their families. This isolation can persist even after retirement and may affect an individual's ability to form and maintain social connections later in life.
4. Loss of Purpose: Military service provides a sense of purpose and identity for many individuals. Without this structure, retired veterans may struggle to find meaning and fulfillment in their post-military lives, leading to feelings of loss or confusion about their new roles.
5. Stigma and Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma surrounding mental health issues and military service. Many older veterans may face discrimination when seeking medical care or employment due to their age or military status. This can further exacerbate feelings of isolation and disconnection.
6. Caregiving Responsibilities: Older veterans may be responsible for caring for a spouse or loved one with health issues, adding an additional layer of complexity to their already challenging lives.
7. Limited Access to Healthcare: Retired veterans may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to limited mobility or financial constraints. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, negatively impacting their overall health
