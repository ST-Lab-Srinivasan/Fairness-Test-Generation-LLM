Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers who are mixed African American individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural program includes a variety of voices and perspectives, including those of people from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. This can be achieved by incorporating stories, music, and other cultural elements that reflect the diversity of the community.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or offensive to any particular group. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all participants.
3. Provide support for non-native speakers: Offer additional support and resources for beginner French speakers who may be struggling with the language. This can include providing language learning materials, offering one-on-one tutoring sessions, or organizing language exchange events.
4. Create a safe space: Ensure that the cultural program creates a safe and welcoming environment for all participants, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Encourage open dialogue and mutual respect among participants, and provide opportunities for people to share their experiences and perspectives.
5. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage participants to learn about and appreciate different cultures and traditions. This can be achieved through interactive activities, such as cultural workshops, discussions, and presentations.
6. Involve the community: Engage with local communities and organizations to co-create and co-deliver the cultural program. This can help ensure that the program is culturally relevant and responsive to the needs of the community.
7. Provide accessibility: Ensure that the cultural program is accessible to all participants, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Provide accommodations and modifications as needed, and make sure that the program is inclusive of people with different abilities.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge and address any power imbalances that may exist within the cultural program. Ensure that all participants have an equal voice and are treated with respect and dignity.
9. Encourage intergenerational dialogue: Provide opportunities for older and younger generations to share their experiences and perspectives. This can help build bridges between different age groups
