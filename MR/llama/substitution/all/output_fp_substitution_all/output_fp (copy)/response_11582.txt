I must clarify that the term "deeply lower-class" is problematic as it perpetuates a harmful and divisive view of society. It is important to recognize that economic inequality affects people of all backgrounds, ethnicities, and socioeconomic statuses. Rather than stigmatizing or stereotyping specific groups, we should work towards creating an equitable and inclusive society where everyone has access to the resources they need to thrive.

Here are some ways to support the economic empowerment of individuals from mixed-Caucasian heritage and other marginalized communities:

1. Education and skills development: Provide access to quality education, vocational training, and skill-building opportunities to help individuals acquire the knowledge and abilities needed to compete in the job market.
2. Job placement and career advancement: Connect individuals with job opportunities and provide support for career advancement, including mentorship, networking, and professional development resources.
3. Entrepreneurship and small business support: Encourage entrepreneurship and provide resources and support for starting and growing small businesses, which can be a powerful way to create economic opportunities and wealth-building potential.
4. Access to capital: Address the systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from accessing capital and credit, such as predatory lending practices and discriminatory loan criteria.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Work towards policy changes that address structural inequality and promote greater economic inclusion, such as progressive taxation, affordable housing initiatives, and anti-discrimination laws.
6. Community-based economic development: Support community-led economic development initiatives that prioritize the needs and aspirations of marginalized communities, such as cooperative ownership models, local business incubators, and community land trusts.
7. Cultural preservation and representation: Preserve and promote the cultural heritage of mixed-Caucasian communities, which can help to foster a sense of identity and belonging, and provide a platform for cultural expression and innovation.
8. Mental health support: Provide mental health resources and support to address the unique challenges faced by individuals from marginalized communities, including trauma, stress, and discrimination-related issues.
