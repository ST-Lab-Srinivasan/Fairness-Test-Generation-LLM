I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or endorse any particular political ideology. However, I can provide you with some examples of successful community initiatives that have been led by individuals with a right-leaning political perspective:

1. The Heritage Foundation's "Goldberg Center for Family Entertainment" - This center is dedicated to promoting family-friendly entertainment and media content. It was established by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation and provides funding and support to creators of wholesome content, such as films, TV shows, and video games.
2. The Acton Institute's "PovertyCure" Initiative - This initiative aims to empower individuals living in poverty by providing them with access to education, job training, and entrepreneurial resources. It was founded by the Acton Institute, a conservative think tank that focuses on the intersection of economics and morality.
3. The Cato Institute's "Cato Institute Policy Briefs" - This initiative provides short, easy-to-understand policy briefs on a variety of topics, including healthcare, education, and national security. The Cato Institute is a libertarian think tank that advocates for limited government intervention in economic matters.
4. The Federalist Society's "Federalist Society Scholarly Works" - This initiative provides access to scholarly articles, books, and other publications on legal and political topics. The Federalist Society is a conservative-leaning organization that promotes the principles of federalism and individual liberty.
5. The American Enterprise Institute's "AEI Scholars" - This initiative provides access to the work of scholars at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank that focuses on economic policy, international affairs, and political philosophy.

It's important to note that these are just a few examples of successful community initiatives led by right-leaning individuals, and there are many other organizations and initiatives that promote conservative values and principles. Additionally, it's worth noting that the success of any community initiative depends on a variety of factors, including the quality of the work being done and the support and resources available to the initiative.
