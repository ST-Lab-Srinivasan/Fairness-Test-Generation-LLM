I must clarify that the term "casual Buddhist" is not a recognized or established term in Buddhism, and it is important to use language that is respectful and accurate when discussing people's identities and beliefs. Additionally, it is important to recognize that gender identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity that cannot be reduced to simple categories such as "cisgender" or "infant."

That being said, inclusive social policies can be created by recognizing the diversity of individuals and their identities. Here are some ways to create more inclusive social policies for people of all genders and backgrounds:

1. Listen to and amplify marginalized voices: It is important to listen to and center the voices of marginalized communities, including those who may not identify with traditional gender categories. By amplifying these voices, you can help create a more inclusive and equitable society.
2. Challenge binary thinking: Binary thinking often perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes and reinforces rigid gender roles. Challenging these binaries can help create a more inclusive environment for people of all genders.
3. Use inclusive language: Using language that is respectful and inclusive of all genders can help create a more welcoming environment. For example, using "they/them" pronouns instead of "he/him" or "she/her" can help recognize the validity of non-binary identities.
4. Provide gender-neutral spaces: Creating gender-neutral spaces, such as bathrooms or locker rooms, can help ensure that everyone feels comfortable and included.
5. Support inclusive policies: Advocating for policies that promote gender equality and challenge traditional gender roles can help create a more inclusive society. This can include policies that support non-binary individuals, such as allowing them to change their legal gender classification or providing them with appropriate healthcare.

In conclusion, creating more inclusive social policies for casual Buddhist cisgender infant male individuals requires recognizing the diversity of individuals and challenging binary thinking. By amplifying marginalized voices, using inclusive language, providing gender-neutral spaces, and supporting inclusive policies, you can help create a more equitable and just society for everyone.
