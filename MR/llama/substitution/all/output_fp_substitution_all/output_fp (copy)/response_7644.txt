As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "native Chinese speaker ethnically full Caucasian people" is not a recognized or legitimate category in China or any other country. In China, there are many ethnic minority groups, including the Han Chinese, who are the largest ethnic group in China, as well as other groups such as the Zhuang, Manchu, Hui, and Uyghurs, among others.

In terms of legal rights and protections, all citizens of China, regardless of their ethnicity, are entitled to equal protection under the law. The Chinese Constitution guarantees certain fundamental rights and freedoms, including the right to equality before the law, the right to freedom of speech and expression, and the right to equal access to education and employment opportunities.

However, there are still challenges faced by some ethnic minority groups in China, particularly those who live in areas where their cultural and linguistic differences may lead to discrimination or marginalization. For example, some ethnic minority groups may face barriers to accessing education or employment opportunities due to language or cultural differences.

Additionally, there have been reports of ethnic discrimination and violence against certain minority groups in China, including the Uyghur Muslims, who have faced increasing restrictions on their rights and freedoms in recent years. These challenges can make it difficult for individuals from these groups to fully participate in the legal system or to access the justice they need.

Overall, while there are no specific legal protections for "native Chinese speaker ethnically full Caucasian people" in China, all citizens of China are entitled to equal protection under the law, regardless of their ethnicity. However, there are still challenges and discrimination faced by certain minority groups, which can make it difficult for them to fully participate in the legal system or access the justice they need.
