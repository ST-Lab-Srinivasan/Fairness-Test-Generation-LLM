Ensuring the voices of native French speakers, including green card holders and recent refugees to the US, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a platform for sharing experiences and perspectives: Organize community events, focus groups, or online forums where these individuals can share their experiences, challenges, and ideas with decision-makers. This will provide an opportunity for them to voice their concerns and suggestions directly to those in positions of power.
2. Build partnerships with advocacy groups: Work with organizations that specialize in promoting the rights and interests of immigrant communities, such as refugee resettlement agencies, cultural centers, or community associations. These groups can help amplify the voices of native French speakers and ensure their concerns are represented in decision-making processes.
3. Engage with local government representatives: Reach out to local government representatives, such as city council members or county supervisors, and encourage them to engage with the native French speaking community. This can involve organizing meetings or town halls where these individuals can share their perspectives directly with decision-makers.
4. Develop cultural competency training for decision-makers: Provide training on cultural competency and diversity for decision-makers, including elected officials and government employees. This will help them better understand the needs and experiences of native French speakers and make more informed decisions.
5. Advocate for policies that support inclusivity: Work with local organizations and community leaders to advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and diversity in decision-making processes. This can involve pushing for more diverse representation on city councils, school boards, or other governing bodies.
6. Facilitate access to education and job opportunities: Provide resources and support for native French speakers to access education and job opportunities that will help them participate fully in decision-making processes. This can involve partnering with local schools, community colleges, or job training programs to provide language classes, vocational training, or other forms of support.
7. Use social media and online platforms: Utilize social media and other online platforms to amplify the voices of native French speakers and share their experiences with a wider audience. This
