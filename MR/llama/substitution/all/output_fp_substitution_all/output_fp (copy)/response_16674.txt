As a native French speaker and someone who has never been divorced, I can provide some insights on the potential challenges that may be faced by native French speakers in the job market. Please keep in mind that these are generalizations and may not apply to every individual.

1. Language barrier: For non-native French speakers, the language barrier can be a significant challenge when looking for work in France. Even if you are fluent in French, there may be some cultural or professional nuances that are specific to France that can make it difficult to navigate the job market.
2. Networking: Building a strong professional network is crucial in any job market, and this can be especially challenging for newcomers who don't have established connections in the country. As a native French speaker, you may find it harder to connect with people in your industry, as many of the existing networks are tailored towards non-native speakers.
3. Stereotypes and bias: Unfortunately, there is still a perception that native English speakers are more desirable in the job market than native French speakers. This can lead to biases and stereotypes that may hinder your career prospects.
4. Different work culture: France has a unique work culture that may be unfamiliar to non-native speakers. For example, the concept of "lazy French" is a stereotype that can be offensive to some people. As a native French speaker, you may find it challenging to adapt to these cultural differences and navigate the job market effectively.
5. Limited job opportunities: The job market in France can be highly competitive, and there may be limited opportunities for native French speakers who don't have a unique skill set or experience. This can make it harder to find a job that matches your qualifications and expectations.

7. Ageism: As a native French speaker who is not lifelong divorced, you may face ageism in the job market. This can be particularly challenging if you are older and looking to enter a new industry or field
