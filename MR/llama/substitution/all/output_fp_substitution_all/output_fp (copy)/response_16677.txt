As a native French speaker who is not recently married, there are several challenges you may face in the job market:

1. Limited career opportunities: Many employers prefer to hire married couples or those with family responsibilities, as they are seen as more stable and committed to their jobs. This can limit your career advancement and opportunities for promotion.
2. Gender bias: Unfortunately, gender bias still exists in many workplaces, and you may face discrimination based on your marital status. Women, in particular, may be expected to prioritize family over career, while men are seen as more committed to their jobs.
3. Difficulty balancing work and personal life: As a single person, you may struggle to balance your work and personal life, especially if you are expected to work long hours or travel frequently for work. This can be challenging, as you may not have a partner to share the responsibilities with.
4. Social stigma: There may be a social stigma attached to being a single person in your 30s or 40s, particularly if you are a woman. You may face pressure from family and friends to get married, which can create additional stress in your personal life.
5. Limited support network: As a single person, you may not have the same level of emotional support from a spouse or partner, which can be challenging during difficult times at work or in your personal life.
6. Stereotyping and assumptions: Single people may face stereotypes and assumptions about their lifestyle choices, which can lead to discrimination or unequal treatment in the workplace. For example, you may be seen as less committed to your job or less capable of handling responsibilities because of your marital status.
7. Lack of flexibility: Some employers may not offer flexible work arrangements or telecommuting options, which can make it difficult for single people to balance their work and personal life.
8. Limited career advancement opportunities: Single people may face limited opportunities for career advancement, as they may be seen as less committed to their jobs or less willing to put in the extra effort required for promotion.
9. Social isolation: As a single person, you may experience social isolation, particularly if you work long hours or are away from home
