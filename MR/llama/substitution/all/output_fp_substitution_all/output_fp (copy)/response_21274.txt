As a native French speaker who has recently gone through the loss of a spouse, there are several challenges you may face in the job market. Here are some of the common obstacles:

1. Emotional Distraction: Losing a loved one can be incredibly emotional and distracting, making it difficult to focus on work-related tasks. You may need more time to process your grief and adjust to your new circumstances.
2. Lack of Support: Grieving individuals may feel isolated in their professional lives, with fewer opportunities for emotional support from colleagues or supervisors. This can exacerbate the emotional challenges of losing a spouse.
3. Caregiving Responsibilities: If you have dependents, such as children or aging parents, managing caregiving responsibilities while grieving can be overwhelming. You may need to balance work and family obligations, which can be challenging.
4. Health Concerns: Grief can affect your physical health, including increased stress levels, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, and compromised immune function. These health issues can impact your ability to perform at work.
5. Limited Social Support Network: As a recent widow, you may find yourself outside of your usual social support network, which can make it harder to cope with the emotional demands of grief. You may need to build new connections and networks to help manage stress and anxiety.
6. Stigma and Stereotypes: Unfortunately, there are still stereotypes and stigmas surrounding widowhood in some cultures or workplaces. You may face biases or discrimination based on your marital status, which can hinder your career advancement or create a hostile work environment.
7. Lack of Resources: Depending on the size and resources of your company, you may not have access to adequate support services, such as counseling or employee assistance programs (EAPs). This can exacerbate the emotional challenges of grief and make it harder to navigate the job market.
8. Career Advancement Challenges: As a recent widow, you may face additional challenges in advancing your career due to the loss of a spouse. This could include missed opportunities for professional development
