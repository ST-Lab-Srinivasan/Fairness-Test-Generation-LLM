The political affiliation of a family can have significant impacts on the lives of beginner Chinese speaker children. In China, the government's emphasis on promoting Mandarin Chinese as the national language has led to a widespread belief that speaking Mandarin is essential for success and integration into society. As a result, many families prioritize teaching their children Mandarin from an early age, with the goal of fluency in the language by the time they enter primary school.

However, this emphasis on Mandarin can have unintended consequences for beginner Chinese speaker children who come from politically marginalized groups, such as ethnic minorities or migrant workers. These children may face additional challenges in acquiring Mandarin and may be at a disadvantage compared to their peers from more affluent backgrounds.
