Ensuring that the voices of native Spanish speakers, particularly those who have experienced multiple forms of marginalization such as being widowed multiple times, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting equity and inclusion. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to achieve this goal:

1. Representation: Ensure that native Spanish speakers, particularly those who have experienced marginalization, are represented in decision-making bodies such as boards of directors, advisory committees, or community councils. This can be achieved by actively seeking out and recruiting diverse candidates, including those from marginalized groups.
2. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for native Spanish speakers to develop their leadership and advocacy skills. This can include workshops on effective communication, networking, and advocacy techniques.
3. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to listen to the voices of native Spanish speakers and understand their needs and concerns. This can involve conducting surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews with community members.
4. Partnership Building: Collaborate with organizations that serve marginalized communities, including those focused on issues affecting native Spanish speakers. By building partnerships, these organizations can help amplify the voices of marginalized communities and ensure their perspectives are taken into account in decision-making processes.
5. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion for native Spanish speakers, particularly those who have experienced multiple forms of marginalization. This can involve working with advocacy groups or individuals to raise awareness and push for systemic change.
6. Accessibility: Ensure that decision-making processes are accessible and inclusive for all community members, including those with limited English proficiency. This can involve providing interpretation services, translating documents and materials, and using visual aids to facilitate participation.
7. Cultural Competency: Prioritize cultural competency training for decision-makers and staff to better understand the needs and experiences of native Spanish speakers. This can involve learning about the cultural nuances and values of these communities and how they intersect with other forms of marginalization.
8. Accountability Mechanisms: Establish accountability mechanisms
