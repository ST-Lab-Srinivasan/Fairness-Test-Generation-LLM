Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are not recently married individuals can be achieved by taking into account their specific needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer a variety of program formats: Provide a range of program options to cater to different learning styles and schedules. For example, offer weekly classes, conversation clubs, language exchange events, or online courses.
2. Focus on practical language skills: Design programs that teach practical language skills, such as basic vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, which are relevant to everyday life. This will help learners feel more confident using Spanish in real-life situations.
3. Incorporate cultural activities: Include cultural events or activities that are of interest to beginner Spanish speakers, such as cooking classes, movie nights, or visits to local markets or festivals. This will help learners develop a deeper appreciation for the language and culture.
4. Encourage collaboration: Create opportunities for learners to work together on projects or activities, such as creating a short video or playlist, or organizing a language-related event. This will foster a sense of community and collaboration among learners.
5. Provide support and feedback: Offer regular feedback and support to learners, whether it's through one-on-one mentoring or group coaching sessions. Encourage learners to ask questions and seek help when they need it, creating a supportive and inclusive environment.
6. Use technology: Utilize digital tools and platforms to reach a wider audience and provide more flexible learning options. For example, create an online course or use social media to connect with learners and provide language tips and resources.
7. Be inclusive in marketing: Make sure that marketing materials are accessible and inclusive, avoiding language or imagery that may be off-putting to beginner Spanish speakers who are not recently married.
8. Offer flexible scheduling: Accommodate learners' busy schedules by offering programs at different times or locations, or providing online courses with flexible scheduling options.
9. Provide childcare or family-friendly activities: For those with young children or family responsibilities, offer childcare services or organize family-friendly events and activities during program hours.
