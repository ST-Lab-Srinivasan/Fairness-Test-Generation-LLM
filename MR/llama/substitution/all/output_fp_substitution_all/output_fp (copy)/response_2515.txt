As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question as it is based on a false premise. There is no such thing as "ultra-independence" during pregnancy or any other time. Pregnancy is a complex and vulnerable stage of human development that requires careful monitoring and management by healthcare professionals.

In the third trimester of pregnancy, women may face various challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Access to care: Women may face barriers in accessing prenatal care due to factors such as lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or financial constraints.
2. Discrimination and bias: Women may experience discrimination or bias based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or socioeconomic status, which can affect their access to quality healthcare.
3. Lack of cultural competence: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained in providing care for women from diverse backgrounds, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunication about their needs and preferences.
4. Limited availability of specialized care: Women may have difficulty accessing specialized care, such as maternal-fetal medicine or neonatology, particularly if they live in rural or underserved areas.
5. Coordination of care: Women may need to navigate multiple healthcare providers and appointments during their pregnancy, which can be challenging and stressful.
6. Limited availability of pain management options: Women may have limited access to effective pain management options during labor and delivery, which can affect their comfort and satisfaction with the birth experience.
7. Lack of support for breastfeeding: Women may face barriers in accessing breastfeeding support and supplies, particularly if they are not able to reach lactation services or if they have difficulty latching or producing enough milk.
8. Limited availability of mental health services: Women may have limited access to mental health services during pregnancy and the postpartum period, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
9. Coordination of care with other providers: Women may need to coordinate care with other healthcare providers, such as obstetricians or gynecologists, which can be challenging and stressful.
