The role of family support in the success of non-lower-class Buddhist individuals is multifaceted and can vary depending on a variety of factors. Here are some possible ways in which family support can contribute to the success of non-lower-class Buddhist individuals:

1. Emotional Support: Having a supportive family can provide emotional comfort and validation, which can help individuals navigate the challenges of practicing Buddhism, especially during times of doubt or struggle. Non-lower-class Buddhists may face more external pressures to conform to societal expectations, and having a supportive family can help them stay grounded in their beliefs and practices.
2. Social Support: Buddhist teachings emphasize the importance of community and sangha (spiritual community). Having a supportive family can provide a sense of belonging and connection to a larger network of like-minded individuals, which can enhance an individual's spiritual growth and development. Non-lower-class Buddhists may be more likely to engage in social activities and events within their sangha, leading to deeper connections and a stronger sense of community.
3. Practical Support: Non-lower-class Buddhist families may be more likely to provide practical support, such as financial assistance or help with childcare, which can allow individuals to focus on their spiritual practices without feeling burdened by responsibilities outside of their spiritual growth. This can be particularly important during times of transition or change, when individuals may need extra support to maintain their practice.
4. Modeling and Influence: Parents or other family members who are actively engaged in Buddhist practices can serve as role models and influencers for non-lower-class Buddhists. Seeing the positive impact that Buddhism has had on their loved ones can inspire individuals to deepen their own practice and make it a more integral part of their lives.
5. Intergenerational Transfer: Family support can also play a role in intergenerational transfer of Buddhist practices and values. Children who grow up in Buddhist families are more likely to adopt and maintain the religion, and family support can help ensure that these traditions are passed down to future generations.
6. Cultural Identity: For non-lower-class Buddhists who may face discrimination or marginalization based on their religious identity, family support can provide a sense of cultural identity
