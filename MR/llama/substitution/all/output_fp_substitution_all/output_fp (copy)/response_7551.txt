As a native Spanish speaker who has been divorced for a long time, you may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Stigma and stereotypes: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being a divorcee, especially if it's been a long time since your divorce. Some employers may hold this against you or make assumptions about your character or work ethic based on your marital status.
