The impact of disability status on the lives of long-term, long-term temporary visa holder, and long-term divorced individuals can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Individuals with disabilities may face challenges in social situations, including difficulty forming and maintaining relationships. This can lead to social isolation, which can have a negative impact on mental health and overall well-being.
2. Stigma and discrimination: People with disabilities may experience stigma and discrimination, which can lead to feelings of low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. This can also limit their opportunities for employment, education, and social participation.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Individuals with disabilities may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including lack of transportation, inaccessible facilities, and discrimination by healthcare providers. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, which can exacerbate their condition.
4. Financial hardship: Individuals with disabilities may experience financial difficulties due to higher costs for healthcare, assistive technology, and home modifications. They may also face barriers in finding employment or accessing government benefits.
5. Limited access to education: Students with disabilities may face barriers in accessing educational resources, including inaccessible buildings, inadequate accommodations, and discrimination by educators. This can result in lower academic achievement and decreased opportunities for future success.
6.

This can limit their ability to participate in social and community activities.
7. Mental health challenges: Individuals with disabilities may experience higher rates of mental health challenges, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), due to the added stresses of living with a disability.
8. Limited access to technology: Individuals with disabilities may face barriers in accessing assistive technology, such as wheelchairs, hearing aids, and communication devices. This can limit their ability to participate in activities and access information.
