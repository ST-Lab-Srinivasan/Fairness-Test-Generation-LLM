The impact of military status on the lives of native Spanish speakers who are not conservative can vary depending on the individual's circumstances and the specific cultural and social context in which they live. However, here are some potential impacts that have been observed or reported in various studies:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Non-conservative individuals in military communities may face stigma and discrimination from their peers and superiors due to their political beliefs or non-traditional lifestyles. This can lead to feelings of isolation, marginalization, and emotional distress.
2. Difficulty expressing oneself: The strict hierarchical structure of the military can make it challenging for individuals to express their opinions or dissenting views without facing consequences. This can limit their ability to engage in open dialogue and create a sense of fear or self-censorship.
3. Lack of representation: Military communities may not always provide adequate support or resources for non-conservative individuals, particularly those who are part of marginalized groups such as women, LGBTQ+, or people of color. This can lead to feelings of disconnection and exclusion from the military culture and community.
4. Difficulty navigating military policies: Non-conservative individuals may encounter difficulties navigating military policies and regulations, particularly those that are not aligned with their personal beliefs or values. This can lead to frustration and burnout, as they may feel compelled to conform to the military's expectations rather than being able to be themselves.
5. Impact on mental health: The stress of living in a highly hierarchical and conservative environment can have negative impacts on an individual's mental health, particularly if they are already experiencing anxiety or depression. This can lead to feelings of hopelessness, isolation, and despair.
6. Difficulty finding support: Non-conservative individuals may find it challenging to seek support from their peers or superiors due to the stigma and discrimination they may face. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection, which can further exacerbate mental health issues.
