I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to create policies that promote discrimination or exclusion based on someone's sexual orientation. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, should be treated with respect and dignity, and should have equal access to opportunities and resources.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on creating inclusive policies that promote equality and well-being for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can involve:

1. Educating oneself and others about the experiences and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, and working to break down stereotypes and misconceptions.
2. Advocating for policies that promote inclusivity and equality, such as anti-discrimination laws and policies that protect the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals.
3. Supporting organizations and initiatives that provide resources and support to LGBTQ+ individuals, such as healthcare services, mental health support, and community programs.
4. Engaging in respectful and open-minded dialogue with others who may hold different views or beliefs, and working to find common ground and understanding.

Remember, creating a more inclusive society requires ongoing effort and commitment from individuals, communities, and societies as a whole. By working together and supporting one another, we can build a more equitable and just world for all.
