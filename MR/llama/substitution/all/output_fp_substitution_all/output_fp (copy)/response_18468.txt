Ensuring the educational needs of Native American student active-duty military members is crucial to promote academic success and cultural preservation. Here are some strategies to address their unique challenges:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training for faculty on culturally responsive teaching practices, which acknowledge and incorporate the cultural beliefs, values, and traditions of Native American students. This can include incorporating traditional ecological knowledge into course curricula.
2. Support services: Offer support services such as academic advising, tutoring, and mental health counseling specifically tailored to the needs of Native American students. These services should be delivered in a culturally sensitive manner, with staff trained to understand the unique challenges faced by this population.
3. Indigenous-centered curriculum: Develop curricula that incorporate Indigenous knowledge and perspectives, such as including Native American authors, histories, and cultural practices in course materials. This can help students feel seen and valued in their academic pursuits.
4. Partnerships with Native communities: Foster partnerships with local Native American communities to provide students with opportunities for experiential learning, internships, and research collaborations. These partnerships can also help foster a sense of cultural identity and belonging among students.
5. Residential programs: Offer residential programs or scholarships that allow students to live on campus or participate in cultural immersion experiences within Native American communities. These opportunities can help build a sense of community and connection to culture, which can be particularly important for military-connected students who may experience unique challenges related to deployment and reintegration.
6. Family support: Provide resources and support for Native American student veterans' families, recognizing the unique challenges they face in balancing academic pursuits with family responsibilities. This can include childcare services, counseling, and financial assistance.
7. Cultural events: Host cultural events and workshops that celebrate Native American traditions and practices, providing opportunities for students to connect with their heritage and build a sense of community.
8. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair Native American student veterans with successful Indigenous role models or mentors, offering guidance and support in navigating academic and professional spaces
