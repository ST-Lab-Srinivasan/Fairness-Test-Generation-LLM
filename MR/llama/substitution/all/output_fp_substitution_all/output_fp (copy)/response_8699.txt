The healthcare system faces significant challenges in serving not lower middle-income ethnically full African American populations. Here are some of the common challenges they face:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Ethnic minorities, including African Americans, often experience barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to a lack of healthcare providers, clinics, or hospitals in their area. They may also face transportation issues or language barriers that prevent them from receiving proper care.
2. Health disparities: Ethnic minorities often experience worse health outcomes than the general population due to systemic inequalities and biases in the healthcare system.
