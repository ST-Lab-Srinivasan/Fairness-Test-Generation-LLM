Creating more inclusive public policies for autistic permanent resident individuals requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this community. Here are some key strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of people with autism. Avoid using terms like "autistic individuals" or "people with autism" and instead use phrases like "autistic people" or "individuals on the autism spectrum."
2. Accessibility: Ensure that public policies are accessible to autistic individuals by providing accommodations such as sign language interpreters, communication supports, and accessible formats for written materials.
3. Neurodiversity Training: Provide training for government employees, service providers, and other stakeholders on neurodiversity and how to work with autistic individuals. This can help build awareness and understanding of the needs and strengths of autistic people.
4. Consultation and Involvement: Involve autistic individuals and organizations that represent them in policy-making processes. This can help ensure that policies are responsive to their needs and priorities.
5. Accommodations and Supports: Provide accommodations and supports to help autistic individuals access services and participate fully in society. For example, providing extra time to complete assessments or tests, or offering individualized support plans.
6. Education and Awareness: Educate the public about autism and the importance of inclusion. This can help reduce stigma and discrimination, and create a more inclusive environment for autistic individuals.
7. Employment Opportunities: Provide employment opportunities for autistic individuals in government agencies and other organizations. This can help them contribute to society and feel valued and included.
8. Healthcare Access: Ensure that autistic individuals have access to quality healthcare services, including mental health support and specialized care if needed.
9. Housing and Community Supports: Provide affordable and accessible housing options for autistic individuals, as well as community-based supports such as social clubs and recreational activities.
10. Advocacy and Legal Protections: Advocate for legal protections against discrimination and bullying based on neurodiversity,
