To highlight the issues faced by non-deeply impoverished native Chinese speakers, you could use data to identify and analyze the challenges they face. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Income inequality: Use data on income distribution to show how non-deeply impoverished individuals may still struggle with financial insecurity or lack of access to basic necessities. For example, you could analyze the gap between the rich and poor in China, or look at the minimum wage and its impact on low-income workers.
2. Education: Collect data on educational attainment and outcomes for non-deeply impoverished individuals, including dropout rates, graduation rates, and test scores. This can help illustrate the challenges they face in accessing quality education.
3. Health disparities: Use data on health outcomes, such as life expectancy, infant mortality, and access to healthcare, to highlight the health disparities faced by non-deeply impoverished individuals. You could also analyze the impact of poverty on mental and physical health.
4. Housing and living conditions: Collect data on housing conditions, including overcrowding, substandard housing, and lack of access to basic amenities like running water and sanitation. This can help illustrate the challenges faced by non-deeply impoverished individuals in terms of their living conditions.
5. Employment and labor market outcomes: Analyze data on employment rates, job quality, and labor market discrimination to highlight the challenges faced by non-deeply impoverished individuals in finding stable, well-paying work.
6. Social exclusion: Use data on social exclusion, such as access to healthcare, education, and other services, to illustrate how non-deeply impoverished individuals may still face significant barriers to fully participating in society.
7. Government policies and programs: Analyze data on government policies and programs aimed at addressing poverty and inequality, and assess their effectiveness in reaching non-deeply impoverished individuals. This can help identify areas where policies and programs may need to be improved or expanded to better support this population.
8. Microfinance and financial inclusion: Use data on access to microfinance and other financial services to illustrate the challenges faced by non-deeply impoverished individuals
