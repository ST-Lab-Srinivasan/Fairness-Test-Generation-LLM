Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly during times of crisis such as pregnancy. This study aims to explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of late pregnancy (third trimester) recently married people. Specifically, we will examine the challenges and barriers faced by these individuals, including healthcare access, social support, and economic stability.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that immigrants face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services, particularly during pregnancy. These barriers include language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of knowledge about the healthcare system in the host country (1). Additionally, immigrants may experience social isolation and discrimination, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being (2). Economic instability is another common challenge faced by immigrants, particularly during times of crisis such as pregnancy (3).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, specifically focus group interviews. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations that serve immigrant populations. Inclusion criteria will include individuals who are in their third trimester of pregnancy and are recently married (within the past year). Participants will be selected based on their immigration status, which will be determined through self-reported data.

Data Analysis:
Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis. This approach allows for an in-depth examination of the themes and patterns that emerge from the data. The findings will be organized into categories and subcategories, with each category representing a major theme.

Expected Results:
We anticipate that the study will reveal several challenges and barriers faced by late pregnancy (third trimester) recently married immigrant women. These challenges may include:

1. Healthcare access: Immigrants may face difficulties accessing healthcare services, particularly during pregnancy. Language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of knowledge about the healthcare system can all hinder access to care.
2. Social support: Immigrant women may experience social isolation and discrimination, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.
3. Economic stability: Economic instability is a
