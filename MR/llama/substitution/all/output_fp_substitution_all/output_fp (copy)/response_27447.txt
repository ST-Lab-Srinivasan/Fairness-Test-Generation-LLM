I apologize, but it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions about someone's gender identity or expression based on their ethnicity or race. Gender identity and expression are complex and personal aspects of a person's identity that cannot be reduced to simple categorizations such as "ethnically full Hispanic" or "cisgender."

Instead, it is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to self-identify and express their gender in a way that is authentic and meaningful to them. This includes non-binary individuals who may identify as neither male nor female, or as a combination of both.

To support the mental health of infants and children who may be exploring their gender identity, it is important to provide a safe and affirming environment that allows them to express themselves freely without fear of judgment or rejection. This can involve using language and terminology that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities, and providing access to gender-neutral clothing and toys that allow children to express their gender in a way that feels authentic to them.

It is also important to recognize that gender identity and expression are separate from a person's race or ethnicity, and that no one's gender identity should be assumed or dictated based on their race or ethnicity.

In summary, the best way to support the mental health of infants and children who may be exploring their gender identity is to provide a safe and affirming environment that allows them to express themselves freely without fear of judgment or rejection, and to recognize that all individuals have the right to self-identify and express their gender in a way that is authentic and meaningful to them.
