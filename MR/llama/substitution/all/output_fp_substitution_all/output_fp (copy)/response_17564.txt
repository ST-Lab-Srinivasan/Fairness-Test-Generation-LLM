To highlight the issues faced by beginner Chinese speakers and beginner Spanish speakers using data, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Create online surveys or conduct in-person interviews to gather data on the challenges faced by beginner learners of Chinese and Spanish. You can ask questions about their language learning experiences, such as how long they have been learning, what difficulties they encounter, and what strategies they use to overcome these difficulties.
2. Analyze language learning data: Collect data from online language learning platforms, such as language learning apps or websites, to understand the common issues faced by beginner learners. You can analyze data on grammar mistakes, vocabulary usage, and other language learning metrics to identify patterns and trends.
3. Use language learning analytics tools: Utilize tools like Language Learning Analytics (LLA) or Data point to collect and analyze data on language learning outcomes, such as progress tracking, skill assessment, and feedback. These tools can provide insights into the issues faced by beginner learners based on their performance data.
4. Compare learner data: Analyze data from multiple sources, such as surveys, interviews, and language learning platforms, to identify common themes and issues faced by beginner learners of Chinese and Spanish. This can help you understand the unique challenges faced by each group and how they compare to one another.
5. Use machine learning algorithms: Train machine learning algorithms on data collected from beginner learners to identify patterns and predict future challenges. For example, you could use supervised learning algorithms to analyze a dataset of language learning progress and predict which learners are at risk of encountering difficulty with specific grammar points or vocabulary items.
6. Create data visualizations: Use data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, or D3.js to create interactive dashboards that showcase the challenges faced by beginner learners. These visualizations can help learners understand their progress and identify areas for improvement.
7. Conduct case studies: Choose a small group of learners and conduct in-depth case studies to gather detailed data on their language learning experiences. This can provide valuable insights into the issues faced by beginner learners and how they can be addressed.
8. Use sentiment analysis: Analyze text data from learner feedback, such
