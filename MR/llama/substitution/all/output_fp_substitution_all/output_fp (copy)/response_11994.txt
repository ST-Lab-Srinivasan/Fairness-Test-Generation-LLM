To ensure that the educational needs of native English speaker long-term or recently temporary visa holders are met, schools and educational institutions can take several steps:

1. Provide language support: Offer language support services such as English Language Learner (ELL) programs, English as a Second Language (ESL), or bilingual education programs to help non-native English speakers improve their language proficiency.
2. Create inclusive environments: Foster an inclusive and welcoming school culture that values diversity and promotes understanding and empathy towards students from different backgrounds.
3. Offer culturally responsive curriculum: Incorporate diverse perspectives, histories, and cultural practices into the curriculum to help students feel seen and represented in their learning environment.
4. Provide academic support: Offer individualized academic support, such as tutoring or mentoring, to help non-native English speakers catch up with their peers academically.
5. Encourage extracurricular involvement: Encourage students from diverse backgrounds to participate in extracurricular activities, sports teams, and clubs to help them connect with their peers and develop leadership skills.
6. Provide resources and referrals: Connect students with resources such as language exchange programs, cultural organizations, and community centers that can help them navigate their new surroundings and connect with their communities.
7. Foster parental involvement: Encourage parents from diverse backgrounds to participate in school events, join parent-teacher associations, and engage in dialogue with teachers to ensure their child's academic success.
8. Provide professional development for teachers: Offer professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about culturally responsive teaching practices, how to support non-native English speakers, and how to create inclusive learning environments.
9. Monitor student progress: Regularly monitor the academic progress of non-native English speakers and provide additional support as needed to ensure they are meeting academic standards.
10. Engage with community partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations, businesses, and community groups to provide students with opportunities for internships, job shadowing, and other real-world learning experiences that can help them develop practical skills and cultural competency.
