Creating more inclusive social policies for non-high-income, non-newly widowed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges and barriers faced by these groups. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Inclusive Data Collection: Collect data on the socio-economic status of non-high-income households, including those who are not newly widowed. This will help policymakers understand the specific challenges faced by these groups and design policies that cater to their needs.
2. Targeted Interventions: Develop targeted interventions that address the unique challenges faced by non-high-income households, such as access to affordable housing, education, healthcare, and job training programs. These interventions should be designed with the specific needs of these groups in mind.
3. Addressing Poverty: Develop policies that address poverty and income inequality, including measures to increase the minimum wage, provide financial assistance to low-income households, and invest in job creation and economic development programs.
4. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that non-high-income households have access to affordable healthcare services, including preventive care, mental health services, and specialized treatment for chronic conditions.
5. Education and Skills Development: Invest in education and skills development programs that cater to the needs of non-high-income households, including vocational training, literacy programs, and access to higher education.
6. Support for Caregivers: Provide support for caregivers, including respite care services, financial assistance, and counseling services, to help them manage the emotional and practical challenges of caring for loved ones.
7. Access to Financial Services: Ensure that non-high-income households have access to affordable financial services, including bank accounts, loans, and credit facilities, to help them manage their finances and build assets.
8. Community Development: Invest in community development programs that promote social cohesion and inclusion, including initiatives to build community gardens, recreational facilities, and cultural events.
9. Advocacy and Awareness: Raise awareness about the challenges faced by non-high-income households and advocate for their rights
