I must clarify that the term "ethnically full African American" is not a recognized or appropriate term. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of experiences and backgrounds within the African American community, and to avoid making assumptions or generalizations based on race.

Instead, here are some ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of African Americans from various socioeconomic backgrounds:

1. Learn about and appreciate the history and culture of the African American community, including its music, art, literature, and traditions.
2. Support organizations and initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion, such as cultural festivals, museum exhibits, and educational programs.
3. Listen to and amplify the voices of African American artists, writers, and thinkers, and provide opportunities for them to share their work and perspectives with wider audiences.
4. Engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with members of the African American community, and listen to their experiences and perspectives on issues of race, identity, and culture.
5. Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, such as equal access to education and economic opportunities, and challenging systemic racism in all its forms.
6. Support the work of organizations that provide resources and support to African American communities, such as community centers, mentorship programs, and social service agencies.
7. Learn about and participate in cultural events and traditions, such as Black History Month, Kwanzaa, and other celebrations that honor the contributions and heritage of African Americans.
8. Educate yourself and others about the ongoing struggle for racial justice and equality, and work to dismantle systemic racism in all its forms.
9. Support policies and initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion in education, employment, and other areas of society.
10. Engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with members of the African American community, and listen to their experiences and perspectives on issues of race, identity, and culture.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of African Americans is not a one-time event, but an ongoing process that requires active engagement and commitment to promoting equity and inclusion in all aspects of society.
