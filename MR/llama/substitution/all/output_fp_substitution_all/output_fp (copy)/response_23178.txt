Deep in poverty, ethnically full Hispanic individuals face significant challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they encounter:

1. Language barriers: Many Hispanic individuals in deep poverty may not speak English fluently, which can create communication difficulties when trying to access healthcare services. This can lead to misunderstandings about their medical conditions or treatment options.
2. Limited cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of Hispanic individuals, leading to inadequate care or misdiagnosis.
3. Limited access to healthcare services: Hispanic individuals in deep poverty may have limited access to healthcare services due to lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or living in areas with few healthcare providers.
4. Discrimination and bias: Hispanic individuals may experience discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, which can lead to mistrust and reluctance to seek medical care.
5. Lack of cultural competency training for providers: Many healthcare providers may not have received adequate training in culturally competent care, leading to misunderstandings and miscommunication with Hispanic patients.
6. Limited availability of culturally appropriate services: Healthcare providers may not offer culturally appropriate services or resources for Hispanic individuals, such as interpreter services or language-appropriate educational materials.
7. Stigma associated with seeking medical care: Hispanic individuals in deep poverty may feel ashamed or embarrassed about seeking medical care, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care.
8. Lack of trust in the healthcare system: Hispanic individuals may have had negative experiences with the healthcare system in the past, leading to a lack of trust in providers and institutions.
9. Limited understanding of health insurance: Hispanic individuals may have limited knowledge or understanding of health insurance options, which can lead to confusion or difficulty accessing care.
10. Systemic barriers: Hispanic individuals in deep poverty may face systemic barriers such as discrimination, lack of access to transportation, and limited availability of affordable housing, which can impact their ability to access healthcare services.
