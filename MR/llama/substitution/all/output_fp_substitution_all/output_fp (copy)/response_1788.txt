The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of children living in poverty can be significant and far-reaching. Children with genetic conditions may face a range of challenges, including:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Children living in poverty may not have access to quality healthcare, including specialized care for genetic conditions. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, which can exacerbate the condition and impact the child's overall health and well-being.
2. Stigma and social isolation: Children with genetic conditions may face stigma and discrimination from their peers and community, leading to social isolation and psychological distress.
3. Limited opportunities for education: Children with genetic conditions may struggle to keep up with their peers in school due to limitations in their cognitive or physical abilities. This can limit their opportunities for education and future career prospects.
4. Financial burden: Caring for a child with a genetic condition can be costly, placing a significant financial burden on families living in poverty. This can lead to difficulties in meeting basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing.
5. Lack of support: Children living in poverty may not have access to support services such as counseling, social work, or advocacy, which can make it difficult for them to cope with the challenges associated with a genetic condition.
6. Limited access to resources: Children with genetic conditions may require specialized equipment or supplies to manage their condition, but these may not be available or affordable for families living in poverty.
7. Poor nutrition: Children with genetic conditions may have difficulty accessing healthy food options due to limited availability or financial constraints, which can impact their overall health and well-being.
8. Limited access to mental health services: Children with genetic conditions may experience increased stress and anxiety due to the challenges they face, but they may not have access to mental health services to help them cope.
9. Difficulty navigating social services: Families living in poverty may struggle to navigate social services and benefits available to them, which can make it difficult for them to receive appropriate support and resources for their child's genetic condition.
10. Limited opportunities for independence
