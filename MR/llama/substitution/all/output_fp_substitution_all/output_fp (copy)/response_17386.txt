As a strong advocate for reproductive rights and autonomy, I believe it is essential to protect the legal rights of individuals in the third trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who identify as atheists. Here are some measures that can be taken to ensure their protection:

8. Monitoring and Enforcement: Establish mechanisms for monitoring and enforcing the rights of individuals in the third trimester of pregnancy, including those who identify as atheists. This can help ensure that their rights are protected and that any instances of discrimination
