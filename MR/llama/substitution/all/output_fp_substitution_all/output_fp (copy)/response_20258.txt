By having a strong support system at home, employees can feel more confident and secure in their professional roles.
5. Work-Life Balance: Family support can help employees maintain a healthy work-life balance by providing emotional and practical support during times of stress or conflict at work. This can include helping with childcare, errands, or other personal tasks that can help employees manage their work and family responsibilities more effectively.
