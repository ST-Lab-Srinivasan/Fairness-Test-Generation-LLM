Addressing the specific needs of beginner Chinese speakers in healthcare requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Provide cultural sensitivity training for healthcare providers: Healthcare providers should be trained to recognize and respect the cultural differences of beginner Chinese speakers, including their language barriers. This can involve education on cultural competency, communication techniques, and empathy towards patients with diverse backgrounds.
