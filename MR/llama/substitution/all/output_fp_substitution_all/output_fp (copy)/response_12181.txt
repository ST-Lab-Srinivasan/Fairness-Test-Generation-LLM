Ensuring the educational needs of active duty military students, including those who are African American, requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach. Here are some strategies that educational institutions can consider to meet the unique challenges faced by this population:

1. Understand the Needs of Military Families: Active duty military students often face unique challenges such as frequent moves, deployment, and family separation. Educational institutions should be aware of these challenges and provide support services specifically designed for military families, including flexible scheduling, online course options, and academic advising tailored to their needs.
2. Provide Military-Friendly Accreditation: Educational institutions should seek accreditation from organizations that specialize in military education, such as the Council on Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) or the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS). This ensures that the institution's programs are designed to meet the unique needs of military students.

For example, an institution might offer a program in military leadership or a degree in military history.

This can include hosting military-related events, providing military-themed course materials, and recognizing the achievements of military students.
