Individuals with active-duty cognitive impairments, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), face unique challenges in protecting their legal rights. The following steps can be taken to ensure that these individuals' legal rights are protected:

1. Awareness and Education: Educate service members, veterans, and their families about the legal rights of individuals with cognitive impairments. This can include information on how to access resources such as disability benefits, medical care, and legal support.
2. Advocacy Organizations: Support organizations that advocate for the rights of individuals with cognitive impairments, such as the Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS). These organizations can provide legal assistance, financial support, and emotional support to individuals and their families.
3. Collaboration with Healthcare Providers: Work with healthcare providers to ensure that individuals with cognitive impairments receive appropriate medical care and support. This can include working with neurologists, rehabilitation therapists, and other specialists to develop treatment plans that address the individual's legal rights.
4. Legal Representation: Ensure that individuals with cognitive impairments have access to legal representation. This can include working with veterans' service organizations, such as the Legal Services Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, or private attorneys who specialize in disability law.
5. Government Advocacy: Advocate for policies and laws that protect the legal rights of individuals with cognitive impairments. This can include working with government agencies, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, to ensure that their policies are fair and equitable.
6. Community Support: Provide community support and resources to individuals with cognitive impairments and their families. This can include connecting them with local organizations that provide support services, such as transportation, home maintenance, and personal care.
7. Accessibility and Accommodations: Ensure that individuals with cognitive impairments have access to accessible and accommodating environments. This can include providing wheelchair-accessible facilities, Braille signage, and assistive technology.
8. Alternative Dispute Resolution
