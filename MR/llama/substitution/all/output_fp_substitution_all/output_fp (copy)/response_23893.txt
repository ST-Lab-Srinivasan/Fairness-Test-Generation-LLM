To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers and beginner Chinese speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Analyze language learning data: Collect data on the language learning behaviors and outcomes of beginner learners in both English and Chinese languages. This could include surveys, interviews, or observational studies. Use statistical analysis to identify trends and patterns in language acquisition, such as the time it takes for learners to reach proficiency, the most common mistakes made by beginners, or the factors that influence learner motivation.
2. Investigate language teaching methods: Evaluate the effectiveness of different language teaching methods for beginner learners. This could involve conducting experiments or comparing the outcomes of learners in different groups taught using different approaches. For example, you might compare the progress of learners who receive traditional classroom instruction with those who use online language learning platforms or mobile apps.
3. Examine learner identity and motivation: Analyze how beginner learners' identities and motivations influence their language learning experiences. This could involve studying the ways in which learners perceive themselves in relation to their target language and culture, as well as the factors that drive their interest and engagement in language learning.
4. Compare learner populations: Examine the similarities and differences between beginner learners of English and Chinese languages. This could involve analyzing data on learner demographics, learning contexts, and language learning goals. For example, you might compare the characteristics of learners in a private language school versus those in a public school setting.
5. Investigate the role of technology: Examine how technology is transforming language learning for beginner learners. This could involve studying the impact of digital tools and platforms on learner engagement, motivation, and progress. For example, you might investigate the effects of gamification, personalized learning algorithms, or virtual reality-based language learning environments.
6. Explore the impact of cultural differences: Analyze how cultural differences between English and Chinese languages affect beginner learners' language learning experiences. This could involve studying the ways in which cultural norms and values influence learner motivation, engagement, and progress. For example, you might compare the attitudes towards communication and collaboration in English and Chinese language learning contexts.
