Supporting upper lower middle-income cognitive impairment communities requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and cultural factors that contribute to cognitive decline. Here are some effective strategies that can be implemented:

1. Community-Based Interventions: Implement community-based interventions that target cognitive impairment in older adults. These interventions should include activities such as cognitive training, physical exercise, and social engagement. Examples of successful community-based interventions include the "Exercise and Cognition" program and the "Brain Training" program.

Examples of successful home-based interventions include the "Home Based" program and the "Cognitive Training" program.
8. Health System Strengthening: Strengthen health systems to provide better
