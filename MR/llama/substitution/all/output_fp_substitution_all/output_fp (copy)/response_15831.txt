Thank you for reaching out! I'm here to help. However, I must clarify that the term "equally heterosexual not recently divorced individuals" is quite broad and may encompass a wide range of people, including those who identify as straight, cisgender, and not recently married or divorced.

To answer your question, it's important to recognize that data can be used to highlight various issues faced by different groups of people. However, it's crucial to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their sexual orientation or marital status. Instead, focus on collecting and analyzing data that provides a comprehensive understanding of the issues faced by these groups.

Here are some ways you could approach this:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Create a survey or interview protocol that captures the experiences and challenges faced by individuals in each group. This could include questions on their social, economic, and cultural backgrounds, as well as any specific issues they may face.
2. Analyze existing data: Look for existing datasets that provide insights into the experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals or those who are not recently divorced. You can use statistical methods to identify patterns and trends in these data.
3. Use secondary data sources: Utilize data from government reports, academic studies, or other reliable sources that provide information on the issues faced by these groups.
4. Triangulate data: Combine multiple sources of data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issues faced by each group. For example, you could use survey data to identify trends in mental health among LGBTQ+ individuals and then combine this with existing literature on the mental health challenges faced by this community.
5. Avoid stereotypes and assumptions: Be mindful of potential biases and stereotypes when collecting and analyzing data. Avoid making assumptions about individuals based on their sexual orientation or marital status, and instead focus on understanding their unique experiences and challenges.

Remember, the goal is to highlight the issues faced by these groups in a respectful and inclusive manner. By using data in a responsible and thoughtful way, you can help promote greater understanding and empathy towards marginalized communities.
