Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native English Speaker Mixed African Americans (NESMAA) requires understanding and valuing their unique experiences, perspectives, and cultural background. Here are some strategies to create more inclusive cultural programs:

1. Centering the voices of NESMAA individuals: Ensure that NESMAA perspectives and experiences are centered in the cultural program by incorporating their stories, histories, and cultural practices. This can be done through workshops, presentations, or creating opportunities for NESMAA individuals to share their experiences.
2. Intersectionality: Consider the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other identities within NESMAA communities. Be aware that cultural programs may have different impacts on different groups, and strive to create inclusive spaces for all.
3. Collaboration with NESMAA communities: Work closely with NESMAA communities to design and implement cultural programs. This involves listening to their needs, concerns, and ideas and incorporating them into the program's development and implementation.
4. Education and training: Provide education and training on diversity, equity, and inclusion for staff and volunteers involved in cultural programs. This can help ensure that everyone is aware of the importance of inclusivity and how to create a welcoming environment for NESMAA individuals.
5. Representation and visibility: Ensure that NESMAA individuals are represented in leadership positions, as performers, and in other roles within cultural programs. Visibility matters, as it helps create a sense of belonging and validation for NESMAA individuals.
6. Cultural competency training: Offer cultural competency training for staff and volunteers involved in cultural programs. This can help them understand the nuances of NESMAA cultures and how to approach cultural practices with respect and sensitivity.
7. Inclusive language and terminology: Use inclusive language and terminology when referring to NESMAA individuals or their cultural practices. Avoid using language that is offensive or stereotypical, and instead use language that is respectful and accurate.
8. Accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to NESMAA individuals with disabilities by providing accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or wheelchair
