Promoting the accessibility of public services for mixed African American gender-nonconforming individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Education and Training: Provide training for public service providers on issues related to gender identity, expression, and nonconformity. This can help them understand and address the specific needs of mixed African American gender-nonconforming individuals.
2. Inclusive Language: Use inclusive language in all public services, including healthcare, education, and social services. This can involve using gender-neutral language and avoiding assumptions about an individual's gender identity.
3. Accessible Facilities: Ensure that public facilities are accessible and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their gender identity. This can involve making adjustments to physical spaces, such as installing gender-neutral bathrooms or creating safe spaces for individuals who may feel uncomfortable in traditional gendered spaces.
4. Gender-Affirming Care: Ensure that healthcare providers are knowledgeable and supportive of mixed African American gender-nonconforming individuals' needs. This can involve providing gender-affirming care, such as hormone therapy or gender-confirmation surgeries, and addressing issues related to mental health and wellness.
5. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes that promote the rights and protections of mixed African American gender-nonconforming individuals. This can involve working with government agencies and advocacy groups to push for legislative changes that address systemic barriers and discrimination.
6. Community Engagement: Engage with mixed African American gender-nonconforming communities through outreach and participation in events. This can help build trust and understanding between service providers and community members, and can involve creating opportunities for community members to provide feedback and input on services.
7. Cultural Competency: Ensure that public services are culturally competent and responsive to the unique experiences and challenges faced by mixed African American gender-nonconforming individuals. This can involve incorporating cultural humility and sensitivity into service delivery, and involving community members in the design and delivery of services.
8. Partnership and Collaboration: Collabor
