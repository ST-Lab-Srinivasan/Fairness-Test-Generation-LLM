Addressing the specific needs of Native American green card holders in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique cultural, historical, and social contexts. Here are some strategies that can help address the educational challenges faced by this community:

Educators can work with community organizations, tribal councils, and other stakeholders to develop culturally responsive programs that support student success.

Educators can work with community members to identify capacity-building needs and develop strategies for addressing them. This may involve providing professional development opportunities, developing infrastructure, or securing funding for educational initiatives.
