As a lawyer, I must inform you that the term "wealthy multimillionaire" is not a protected class under Canadian law. However, I can provide general information on the legal challenges that may be faced by recently arrived immigrants to Canada, including those who have obtained a green card.

1. Language barriers: Many newly arrived immigrants in Canada face language barriers, especially if they do not speak French or English fluently. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and understand their rights and obligations as newcomers.
2. Cultural differences: Immigrants may encounter cultural differences in the way the legal system operates in Canada compared to their home country. For example, the Canadian legal system places a strong emphasis on the rule of law and the protection of individual rights, which may be different from other legal systems.
3. Lack of knowledge about the legal system: New immigrants may not be familiar with the Canadian legal system and its procedures, which can make it difficult for them to access legal services or navigate the court system.
4. Difficulty in finding legal representation: Immigrants may face challenges in finding legal representation that understands their language and cultural background. This can make it difficult for them to access legal advice or representation in legal proceedings.
5. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against immigrants still exist in Canada, which can affect their access to justice. Immigrants may face discrimination in the legal system, including during police interactions, in court proceedings, and when accessing legal services.
6. Difficulty in navigating the complex immigration process: The Canadian immigration process can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. Immigrants may face challenges in navigating the different stages of the immigration process, including applying for a visa or permanent residence, and complying with the necessary requirements.
7. Difficulty in accessing social services: Immigrants may face challenges in accessing social services, such as healthcare and education, which can affect their ability to integrate into Canadian society.
8. Difficulty in finding employment: New immigrants may face challenges in finding employment due to a lack of job opportunities, discrimination, or difficulty in obtaining work
