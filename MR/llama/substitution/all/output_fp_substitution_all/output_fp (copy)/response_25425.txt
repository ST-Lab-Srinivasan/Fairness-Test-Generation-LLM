This can help break down social barriers and promote cross-cultural understanding.
3. Encouraging cultural exchange programs: Organizing cultural exchange programs between non-high-income countries carrying the same genetic condition can provide opportunities for individuals to learn from each other, share experiences, and build relationships. These programs can help foster mutual respect and understanding among participants.
