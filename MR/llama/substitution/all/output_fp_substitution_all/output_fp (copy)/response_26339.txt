2. Emotional distress: The grieving process can be emotionally draining, making it difficult for bereaved individuals to focus on work-related tasks, attend meetings, or interact with colleagues. They may struggle to maintain their emotional composure in the workplace, leading to feelings of embarrassment or shame.
3. Absenteeism and reduced productivity: Bereaved individuals may need to take time off for funeral arrangements, hospital visits, or personal appointments related to their loss. This can lead to missed deadlines, reduced productivity, and lower quality work due to distraction or emotional exhaustion.

They may find it challenging to express themselves clearly, respond to inquiries, or maintain their usual level of professionalism.
