The military status of a person can have significant impacts on their life, particularly for native Chinese speakers who are not independent individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited job opportunities: In China, military service is compulsory for men, and women are encouraged to join as well. As a result, many young people may face limitations in their job opportunities due to their military status. Even after their service is complete, they may find it challenging to secure employment outside of the military or defense-related industries.
2. Financial constraints: Military service can be expensive, and individuals may face financial strains due to the costs associated with enlisting, including uniforms, equipment, and living expenses during training. Additionally, their military salary may not be sufficient to cover all of their financial needs, particularly if they have dependents.
3. Time away from family: Military service can involve long periods of time away from one's family, which can be emotionally challenging for both the individual and their loved ones. This can lead to strained relationships and emotional distress, particularly if the individual is deployed overseas or experiences prolonged separations.
4. Limited personal freedom: Military service often involves strict rules and regulations, which can limit an individual's personal freedom. This can include restrictions on travel, communication, and access to information, as well as the requirement to follow orders without question.
5. Stigma and social isolation: In some communities, there may be a stigma associated with military service, particularly if the individual is seen as being "under the control" of the government or military authorities. This can lead to social isolation and difficulties in forming relationships outside of the military community.
6. Lack of career advancement opportunities: Depending on their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) or rank, individuals may face limited career advancement opportunities within the military. This can be particularly challenging for those who are interested in pursuing a particular field or specialization.
7. Health risks: Military service can involve physical and mental health risks, including exposure to hazardous materials, intense physical exertion, and psychological stress. These risks can have long-term impacts on an individual's health, particularly if they experience traumatic events during their military service.
