Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers with mixed Asian heritage can be achieved by considering the following strategies:

1. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the participants. Avoid assumptions or stereotypes based on race, ethnicity, or nationality. Instead, focus on creating a welcoming environment where everyone feels valued and respected.
2. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using terms that are offensive or insensitive to any particular group. For example, instead of using the term "Asian," use "mixed Asian heritage" or "Multiracial" to be more inclusive.

9. Intergenerational Exchange: Encourage interaction between different age groups within the community. This can help build relationships and foster a sense of belonging among individuals from diverse backgrounds.
10. Celebration of Diversity: Embrace the diversity of cultures and traditions within the community. Celebrate and recognize
