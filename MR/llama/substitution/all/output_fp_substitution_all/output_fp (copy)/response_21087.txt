To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish and Chinese speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Conduct surveys or polls: Create online surveys or polls to gather information from beginner learners of Spanish and Chinese about their challenges, struggles, and motivations. This can help identify common issues and areas where learners need more support.
2. Analyze language learning data: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of language learning interactions, such as conversation logs or language learning apps usage data. This can help identify patterns and trends in how learners progress, what challenges they face, and what factors influence their motivation and engagement.
3. Use sentiment analysis: Analyze text data from social media platforms, online forums, or language learning apps to understand the emotions and opinions of beginner learners. This can help identify common issues and concerns, such as frustration with grammar rules or difficulty finding resources.
4. Create a user feedback system: Develop a user feedback system that allows learners to provide feedback on their language learning experience. This can include surveys, ratings, or open-ended questions to gather insights into what works well and what needs improvement.
5. Collaborate with educators: Work with educators and language instructors to gather their insights and observations on the challenges faced by beginner learners. This can help identify issues that may not be immediately apparent through data analysis alone.
6. Use data visualization: Use data visualization techniques to present the data in an engaging and easily understandable format, such as infographics or interactive dashboards. This can help highlight key findings and trends in a clear and concise manner.
7. Identify common pain points: Analyze the data to identify common pain points or challenges faced by beginner learners. For example, you may find that many learners struggle with grammar rules, have difficulty finding resources, or struggle to practice speaking and listening.
8. Develop targeted solutions: Once you have identified the issues, develop targeted solutions to address them. This could involve creating tailored learning materials, developing new educational technologies, or providing additional support and resources for learners.
9. Monitor progress: Continuously monitor the progress of beginner learners over time to evaluate the effectiveness of your solutions and identify areas for improvement.
