Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of physically disabled native Chinese speaker individuals. In this study, we aim to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of these individuals in China. We will examine how marital status affects their social relationships, economic well-being, and overall quality of life.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that disabled individuals face various challenges in their daily lives, including societal stigma, limited access to resources and opportunities, and reduced social participation (Lundstrom & Gunnar, 2016). Marital status can further complicate the lives of these individuals, as they may encounter additional barriers and discrimination based on their relationship status.

They may also experience higher levels of social isolation and loneliness due to their lack of a supportive partner or family (Coleman & Blau, 2017).

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. We will recruit a sample of 100 physically disabled native Chinese speaker individuals, aged 18-65 years old, from various cities in China. Participants will complete a survey that assesses their marital status, social relationships, economic well-being, and overall quality of life. We will also conduct in-depth interviews with a subset of participants to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and challenges.

Results:
Our results indicate that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of physically disabled native Chinese speaker individuals. Married individuals report higher levels of social support and caregiving compared to unmarried individuals, but also experience
