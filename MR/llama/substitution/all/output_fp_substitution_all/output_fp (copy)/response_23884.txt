As a non-low-income green card holder natural-born US citizen, there may be several challenges you face when accessing healthcare in the United States. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of Health Insurance: As a non-low-income individual, you may not have access to affordable health insurance through your employer or as an individual. This can make it difficult to pay for medical services, especially if you have a chronic illness or need ongoing treatment.
