Creating more inclusive social policies for non-disabled progressive individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the various barriers and discrimination faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Challenging ableism: Ableism is a form of discrimination or prejudice against people with disabilities. Challenging ableism requires recognizing and addressing the ways in which society perpetuates negative attitudes towards disability, such as through media representation, education, and employment practices.
2. Inclusive language: Using inclusive language is essential for creating a more inclusive environment. This includes avoiding language that perpetuates negative stereotypes or marginalizes people with disabilities, such as using the term "disabled" as an insult. Instead, use person-first language, such as "person with a disability."
3. Accessible infrastructure: Ensuring that public spaces and infrastructure are accessible to all individuals is crucial for creating an inclusive society. This includes things like wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
4. Education and awareness-raising: Educating the broader community about disability rights and the experiences of non-disabled progressive individuals can help challenge ableism and promote greater inclusion. This can involve organizing workshops, events, and campaigns that raise awareness about disability issues.
5. Employment opportunities: Providing employment opportunities for non-disabled progressive individuals can help address the economic marginalization of this group. This includes providing accommodations in the workplace, such as flexible work arrangements or assistive technology.
6. Healthcare access: Ensuring that healthcare services are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their disability status, is crucial for promoting greater inclusion. This includes providing accessible medical facilities and equipment, as well as training healthcare professionals in disability awareness and sensitivity.
7. Political representation: Ensuring that non-disabled progressive individuals have a voice in political decision-making processes is essential for creating a more inclusive society. This can involve increasing the representation of people with disabilities in politics, as well as advocating for policies that benefit this group.
8. Social support networks: Creating social support networks
