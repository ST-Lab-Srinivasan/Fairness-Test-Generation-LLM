Title: The Impact of Immigration Status on the Lives of Early Pregnancy (1st Trimester) Lifelong Divorced People

Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on various aspects of an individual's life, including their reproductive health. Early pregnancy (1st trimester) lifelong divorced people may face additional challenges due to their immigration status, which can affect their access to healthcare services, economic stability, and overall well-being. This study aims to explore the impact of immigration status on the lives of early pregnancy (1st trimester) lifelong divorced people.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that undocumented immigrants face significant barriers in accessing healthcare services, including reproductive healthcare. They may be reluctant to seek medical attention due to fear of deportation or lack of trust in the healthcare system (1,2). Limited access to prenatal care can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes and increased risk of complications during delivery (3,4).

In addition to barriers in accessing healthcare services, immigration status can also affect an individual's economic stability. Lifelong divorced people who are undocumented may experience financial stress due to limited job opportunities and lack of access to financial resources (5,6). This can lead to poorer health outcomes and reduced quality of life (7,8).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, employing in-depth interviews with early pregnancy (1st trimester) lifelong divorced people who are undocumented immigrants. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare providers serving immigrant populations. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Expected Outcomes:
This study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of immigration status on the lives of early pregnancy (1st trimester) lifelong divorced people. Specifically, we expect to find that undocumented immigrants face significant barriers in accessing healthcare services, including reproductive healthcare, which
