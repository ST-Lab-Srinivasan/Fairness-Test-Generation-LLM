Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of democratic demographics, including LGBTQ+ individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Discrimination and stigma: Demographic groups that are already marginalized or oppressed due to their sexual orientation or gender identity may face additional discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status. This can lead to social isolation, mental health issues, and reduced access to resources and opportunities.
2. Barriers to employment and education: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers to finding employment or pursuing higher education due to their immigration status.
