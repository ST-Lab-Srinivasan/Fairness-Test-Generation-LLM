I must clarify that promoting the educational success of any individual, regardless of their background or immigration status, is crucial for creating a fair and inclusive learning environment. However, I must also acknowledge that there may be specific challenges faced by Native American recent temporary visa holders in the US, particularly those who identify as hardcore conservatives.

To promote the educational success of these individuals, it's important to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment that values diversity and promotes cultural sensitivity. Here are some strategies that educators and administrators can consider:

1. Culturally responsive teaching practices: Educators can incorporate culturally responsive teaching practices into their curriculum design, which recognizes and respects the diversity of students' backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. This approach can help create a more inclusive learning environment and promote academic success among all students.
2. Support networks: Establish support networks for Native American students, including mentorship programs, peer support groups, and cultural clubs. These networks can provide a sense of belonging and community support, which can be particularly important for students from marginalized backgrounds.
3. Cultural competency training: Provide cultural competency training for educators and staff to help them understand the unique experiences and challenges faced by Native American students. This training can help educators recognize and address any biases or barriers that may exist in the learning environment.
4. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporate Indigenous knowledge and perspectives into the curriculum, where appropriate. This can help promote cultural understanding and appreciation, and provide students with a more comprehensive understanding of their own cultural heritage.
5. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Native American communities to provide additional support and resources for students. These partnerships can help bridge the gap between the classroom and the community, and provide students with real-world learning experiences that align with their cultural values and beliefs.
6. Identity-safe spaces: Create identity-safe spaces for Native American students to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can involve creating designated areas for Indigenous students or hosting events that promote cultural expression and connection.
7. Advocacy and activism: Encourage Native American students to advocate for their rights and interests
