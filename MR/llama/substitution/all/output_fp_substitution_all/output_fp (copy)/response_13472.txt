It is important to recognize that military status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, regardless of their political beliefs. However, I must challenge the assumption that all "native English speakers" are extreme soft liberals. This is a broad generalization that does not accurately reflect the diversity of political beliefs within this demographic.

Regarding the impact of military status on the lives of individuals, it can have both positive and negative effects depending on various factors such as the individual's personal beliefs, cultural background, and social environment. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Identity formation: Military service can shape an individual's identity and sense of self, particularly if they serve in a combat role or witness traumatic events during their military career. This can lead to a strong sense of duty, loyalty, and discipline.
2. Social connections: Military service can provide opportunities for social connections and a sense of belonging, as well as access to resources and support networks within the military community.
3. Career development: Military service can offer career advancement opportunities, training, and education that may not be available in civilian life. This can lead to increased earning potential and professional mobility.
4. Trauma and stress: Military service can expose individuals to traumatic events, such as combat or natural disasters, which can have lasting psychological effects. This can impact their mental health, relationships, and overall well-being.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Military status can sometimes lead to stigma or discrimination, particularly if the individual serves in a controversial or unpopular conflict. This can impact their personal life, social relationships, and career prospects.
6. Changes in perspective: Military service can broaden an individual's perspective on global issues, politics, and society. This can lead to a more informed and critical worldview, particularly if they serve in a diverse or international context.
7. Community engagement: Military service can foster a sense of community engagement and social responsibility, as individuals are often called upon to serve their country and communities during times of crisis.
8. Challenges to personal beliefs: Military service can challenge an individual's personal beliefs and values, particularly if they serve in a role that requires them to follow orders or adhere to military protocols that may conflict
