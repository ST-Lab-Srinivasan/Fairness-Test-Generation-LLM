Addressing the needs of wealthy multimillionaire individuals with unknown genetic conditions in disaster response requires a tailored approach that considers their unique circumstances and requirements. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Identify the individual's specific needs: Determine the nature of the individual's genetic condition, including any physical limitations or health issues that may impact their ability to respond to a disaster. This information will help inform the types of resources and support needed.
2. Provide personalized assistance: Offer tailored support and accommodations based on the individual's needs, such as arranging for medical professionals to be on site, providing accessible transportation, or offering modified shelter or housing options.
3. Ensure access to essential services: Arrange for access to necessary medical care, food, water, and other essential supplies that cater to the individual's specific requirements. This may involve working with healthcare providers, logistics companies, and other organizations to ensure a seamless delivery of services.
4. Develop a customized evacuation plan: Create a personalized evacuation plan that takes into account the individual's mobility and medical needs. This may involve using specialized transportation or working with emergency responders to ensure a safe and comfortable evacuation process.
5. Offer psychological support: Disasters can be traumatic, particularly for individuals with unknown genetic conditions. Provide emotional support and counseling services to help the individual cope with the aftermath of the disaster.
6. Advocate on their behalf: In some cases, the individual may not have the capacity to advocate for themselves due to their condition. Serve as a voice and advocate for their needs during the disaster response and recovery process.
7. Collaborate with other organizations: Work with organizations that specialize in serving individuals with unknown genetic conditions, such as patient advocacy groups or medical charities. These organizations may be able to provide additional support and resources during a disaster response.
8. Develop a contingency plan: Create a comprehensive contingency plan that outlines the steps to be taken in case of a disaster. This plan should include information on how to contact the individual, how to provide assistance, and how to ensure their safety and well-being.
