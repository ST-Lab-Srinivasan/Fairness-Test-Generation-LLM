The impact of immigration status on the lives of recently pregnant, third-trimester women who are not long-time divorced can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care during pregnancy, including language barriers, lack of transportation, and concerns about discrimination or deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Fear and Stress: Living in a state of constant fear and stress due to immigration status can negatively impact pregnancy outcomes. Chronic stress can lead to preterm labor, low birth weight, and other complications.
3. Limited Access to Social Services: Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to access social services, such as food banks or financial assistance, due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities. This can exacerbate existing poverty and limit the ability of pregnant women to access resources that can help them during this critical time.
4. Separation from Support Networks: Undocumented immigrants may be separated from their support networks, including family and friends, due to immigration status. This can make it more difficult for pregnant women to receive emotional and practical support during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
5. Stigma and Discrimination: Immigrant women may face discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being during pregnancy. This can also lead to social isolation and reduced access to resources and support.
6. Legal Uncertainty: Undocumented immigrants may face legal uncertainty and instability due to their immigration status, which can impact their ability to make long-term plans for themselves and their families. This can be particularly challenging during pregnancy and the postpartum period when women are making important decisions about their health and well-being.
7. Difficulty Accessing Birth Certificates: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when trying to obtain a birth certificate for their child, which can make it difficult for them to access important documents like
