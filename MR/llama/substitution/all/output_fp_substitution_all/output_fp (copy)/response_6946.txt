Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those in their third trimester of pregnancy. The stress and uncertainty of immigration proceedings can affect the mental and physical health of pregnant individuals, leading to potential complications during pregnancy and childbirth. This paper will explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of recently late-pregnant (third trimester) not divorced for a long time people.

Impact on Mental Health:
The uncertainty and stress of immigration proceedings can lead to increased levels of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among pregnant individuals. The constant worry about their immigration status can make it difficult for them to focus on prenatal care and other important aspects of pregnancy. This can result in poor mental health outcomes, including increased levels of anxiety and depression during pregnancy.

Impact on Physical Health:
The stress of immigration proceedings can also have a significant impact on physical health. Chronic stress can lead to changes in the body's hormonal balance, which can affect the placenta and fetal development. This can result in low birth weight, premature birth, and other complications during childbirth. Additionally, the constant worry about immigration status can make it difficult for pregnant individuals to access necessary prenatal care, leading to potential health problems for both the mother and the baby.

Impact on Daily Life:
Immigration status can also significantly impact the daily lives of pregnant individuals. The fear of deportation and separation from their families can make it difficult for them to seek medical attention or access other essential services. This can result in delayed prenatal care, which can lead to complications during pregnancy and childbirth. Additionally, the constant worry about immigration status can make it challenging for pregnant individuals to maintain a healthy diet and exercise routine, which can affect fetal development.

Impact on Future Health:
The impact of immigration status on the lives of recently late-pregnant (third trimester) not divorced for a long time people can also have long-term effects on future health. Children born to undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing
