Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who are recently divorced and learning a new language. In the case of Chinese language learners, cultural heritage can influence their motivations, attitudes, and behaviors towards language acquisition.

The Importance of Cultural Heritage:
Cultural heritage refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, and practices of a particular group or society. It encompasses the history, traditions, and artifacts that are passed down from one generation to the next.
