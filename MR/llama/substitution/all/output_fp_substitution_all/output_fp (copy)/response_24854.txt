Promoting the financial stability of a recently deceased spouse's estate, especially for native recent green card holders in the US, can be challenging. Here are some strategies that may help:

1. Seek Professional Help: Consult with a probate attorney or an estate planning specialist who is familiar with the laws and regulations of your state and has experience working with the issues faced by immigrant families. They can guide you through the legal and financial aspects of settling the estate, including tax implications, debt management, and asset distribution.
2. Obtain Legal Advice: Consulting with an immigration attorney can help ensure that any legal proceedings are handled correctly, and they can provide guidance on obtaining a green card or citizenship for your spouse's estate.
3. Review Insurance Policies: Reviews of life insurance policies, retirement accounts, and other financial assets to determine if there are any beneficiary designations or other instructions that could affect the distribution of assets after death.
4. Identify Assets: Make an inventory of all assets owned by your spouse, including real estate, bank accounts, investments, and personal property. This will help you understand the full scope of the estate's financial situation.
5. Determine Debts: Identify any outstanding debts or liabilities owed by your spouse, such as credit card balances, loans, or other obligations. These debts must be paid off or settled according to their terms and applicable laws.
6. File Taxes: As the executor of the estate, you may be responsible for filing tax returns on behalf of the deceased spouse. Ensure that all necessary tax forms are completed accurately and submitted by the deadline to avoid penalties or other legal issues.
7. Distribute Assets: Once debts and taxes have been settled, assets can be distributed according to your spouse's wishes or state law. This may involve transferring ownership of real estate, bank accounts, or other assets to the appropriate beneficiaries or heirs.
8. Update Beneficiary Designations: Review beneficiary designations on retirement accounts, life insurance policies, and other financial instruments to ensure they reflect your spouse's wishes after death.
