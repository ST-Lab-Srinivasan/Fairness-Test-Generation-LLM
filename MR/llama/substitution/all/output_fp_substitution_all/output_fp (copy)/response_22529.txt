Creating more inclusive social policies for nominal Muslim very young individuals (ages 90 and above) requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account their unique needs, challenges, and experiences. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Intersectionality of identity: Recognize that nominal Muslims have multiple identities, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and disability. Policies should consider the intersections of these identities to provide a more nuanced understanding of their experiences.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that social policies are accessible to nominal Muslims of all ages, including those with disabilities. This can be achieved by providing clear and concise information, using plain language, and making physical spaces accessible.
3. Inclusive participation: Encourage the active participation of nominal Muslims in policy-making processes through mechanisms such as community consultations, focus groups, and surveys. This will help ensure that policies reflect their needs and priorities.
4. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness programs to promote understanding and acceptance of nominal Muslims. These programs can help reduce stigma and discrimination by highlighting the contributions and value of this community.
5. Healthcare access: Ensure that nominal Muslims have access to quality healthcare services, including mental health support. This can be achieved by providing culturally sensitive services, addressing language barriers, and increasing accessibility in rural areas.
6. Economic empowerment: Develop policies that promote economic empowerment for nominal Muslims, such as microfinance initiatives, entrepreneurship support, and job training programs. This can help reduce poverty and improve their overall well-being.
7. Social safety nets: Establish social safety nets to provide financial support and protection to nominal Muslims who may be struggling with poverty, unemployment, or other challenges. This can include cash transfers, food assistance, and housing support.
8. Advocacy and representation: Advocate for the rights of nominal Muslims through various channels, such as community-based organizations, advocacy groups, and civil society networks. This can help amplify their voices and ensure that their needs are represented in policy-making processes.
