I must clarify that creating inclusive cultural celebrations for any individual or group should be done with respect and sensitivity towards their identity, regardless of their gender, wealth, or any other characteristic. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations for actively partially identifying as male identifying wealthy multimillionaire individuals:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite members of this community to participate in the planning and decision-making process of cultural celebrations. This will ensure that their needs, preferences, and values are taken into account and that they feel included and represented.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or stereotypical of any gender, wealth, or identity. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, such as "actively partially identifying as male" instead of "male."
3. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that cultural celebrations are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. This can include providing wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or other accommodations as needed.
4. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of individuals and communities during cultural celebrations. Highlight the unique contributions and experiences of different groups, and create opportunities for intercultural dialogue and exchange.
5. Challenge stereotypes: Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing harmful gender roles or expectations. Instead, challenge these stereotypes by promoting inclusive representations of masculinity and identity.
6. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a sense of belonging among all individuals involved in cultural celebrations. Encourage participants to share their experiences, traditions, and practices, and provide opportunities for connection and exchange.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge and address any power imbalances that may exist within cultural celebrations. Ensure that all voices are heard and respected, and that the rights and dignity of marginalized groups are protected.
8. Provide safe spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can include designated gender-neutral bathrooms or other safe spaces for individuals who may feel uncomfortable in traditional gendered settings.
