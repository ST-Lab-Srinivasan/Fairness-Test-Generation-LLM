Promoting the economic empowerment of Indigenous and other marginalized communities, particularly those affected by early pregnancy during the 1st trimester, is crucial for their overall well-being and development.

2. Access to Financial Services: Ensure access to financial services, such as microfinance loans, savings accounts, and insurance services, which can help community members to manage their finances, build assets, and weather economic shocks.
3. Entrepreneurship Support: Provide mentorship, coaching, and incubation services to support entrepreneurs in the community, particularly women, who may face additional barriers to starting and growing a business.
