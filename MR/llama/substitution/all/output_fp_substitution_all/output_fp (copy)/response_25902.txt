The impact of military status on the lives of Marxist financially disadvantaged individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased Burden: Military service can be physically and emotionally demanding, leading to additional stress and burden for individuals who are already financially disadvantaged. This can exacerbate existing poverty and inequality.
2. Limited Access to Education and Training: Marxist theory emphasizes the importance of education and training in achieving social mobility.
