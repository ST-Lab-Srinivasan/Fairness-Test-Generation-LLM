I must clarify that the term "recent temporary visa holder" is quite broad and could encompass a wide range of individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and legal statuses. Therefore, I will provide a general answer that applies to all individuals in this category, while also acknowledging that specific laws and regulations may vary depending on the individual's circumstances.

To ensure the legal rights of recent temporary visa holders to the US are protected, it is essential to understand the legal framework that governs their immigration status. The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) outlines the rights and responsibilities of non-citizens in the US, including those on temporary visas.

Here are some key legal protections that recent temporary visa holders should be aware of:

1. Non-discrimination: The INA prohibits discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, religion, and sexual orientation. This means that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, are entitled to equal treatment under the law.
2. Due process: Temporary visa holders have the right to due process, which includes the opportunity to contest any immigration action taken against them before an immigration judge. They also have the right to seek judicial review of any adverse decisions.
3. Right to counsel: Temporary visa holders have the right to legal representation during immigration proceedings. If they cannot afford an attorney, they may be eligible for a free or low-cost lawyer through the Department of Justice's Office of the Public Defender.
4. Protection against unlawful detention: The INA prohibits immigration officers from detaining individuals without proper authority. Temporary visa holders who are detained must be informed of their rights and provided with a written explanation of the reasons for their detention.
5. Access to social services: Temporary visa holders may be eligible for certain social services, such as Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), depending on their income and family size. They can also access mental health services and other support services through community-based organizations.
6. Protection against employment discrimination: The Immigration Reform and Control Act
