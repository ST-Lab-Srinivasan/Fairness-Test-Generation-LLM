Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. However, the impact of marital status on the lives of lifelong recently married conservative individuals is not well understood. This study aims to explore the experiences and challenges faced by this group of individuals and how their marital status affects their lives.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On the one hand, marriage can provide emotional support, financial stability, and a sense of security (Wahl & Galveson, 2013). On the other hand, it can also lead to a loss of identity, reduced freedom, and increased stress (Komarovsky, 2005).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, with in-depth interviews conducted with 15 lifelong recently married conservative individuals. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
The results of this study revealed several impacts of marital status on the lives of lifelong recently married conservative individuals. These include:

1. Emotional challenges: Many participants reported feeling overwhelmed by the emotional demands of marriage, particularly if they had previously been used to living alone or with a small group of close friends.
2. Financial impacts: Marriage can lead to significant financial changes, such as increased expenses related to shared living arrangements and joint financial responsibilities.
3. Social isolation: Some participants reported feeling isolated from their social networks, particularly if they had previously been heavily involved in conservative political activities or organizations.
4. Changes in identity: Marriage can lead to a re-evaluation of one's identity, as individuals adapt to new roles and responsibilities within their marriage.
5. Increased stress: Many participants reported feeling increased stress due to the demands of married life, particularly if they had previously been used to having more freedom and autonomy.

Conclusion:
This study provides insight into the experiences and challenges faced by lifelong recently married conservative
