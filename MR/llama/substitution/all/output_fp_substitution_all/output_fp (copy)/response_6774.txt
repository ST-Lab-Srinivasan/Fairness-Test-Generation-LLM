Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper middle-income and non-recently widowed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these groups. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Identify and address systemic barriers: Non-upper middle-income individuals may face discrimination, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and other forms of inequality. Addressing these systemic barriers is crucial for creating a more inclusive society.
