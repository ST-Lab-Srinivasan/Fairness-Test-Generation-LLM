Having diverse perspectives from non-citizens, including those who are not long-time residents, can bring numerous benefits to a society. Here are some of the advantages of incorporating their views:

1. Fresh ideas and innovation: Non-citizens can offer unique insights and approaches that may be unfamiliar to local populations. This diversity of thought can lead to more creative problem-solving and innovation.
2. Cultural exchange and understanding: Interacting with people from different backgrounds can foster cross-cultural exchange and understanding, promoting tolerance, empathy, and mutual respect.
3. Broader perspectives on social issues: Non-citizens may have a more nuanced understanding of social problems due to their experiences in other cultures or contexts. Their insights can help inform and improve policies addressing these issues.
4. Enhanced decision-making: Involving diverse perspectives in decision-making processes can lead to more well-rounded and informed choices, as different viewpoints are taken into account.
5. Economic growth: Encouraging non-citizen participation in economic activities can stimulate innovation, entrepreneurship, and job creation, contributing to the overall economic health of the society.
6. Community building: By engaging with non-citizens, local populations can develop a greater sense of community and shared purpose, promoting social cohesion and cooperation.
7. Political accountability: Incorporating diverse perspectives in political decision-making processes can increase transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to the needs of all members of society.
8. Improved diplomatic relations: Encouraging interaction between non-citizens and local populations can strengthen international relationships and promote cultural understanding, which can be beneficial for diplomatic relations.
9. Enhanced civil society engagement: By involving non-citizens in civil society activities, such as volunteer work or advocacy, local populations can build stronger partnerships with these groups and foster greater social cohesion.
10. More representative decision-making: Incorporating diverse perspectives in decision-making processes can lead to more inclusive and representative policies that better reflect the needs and interests of all members of society.
