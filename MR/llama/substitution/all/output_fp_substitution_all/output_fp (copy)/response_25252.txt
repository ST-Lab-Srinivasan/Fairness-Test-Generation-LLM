The impact of disability status on the lives of long-term temporary visa holders who are recently divorced can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased financial stress: As a result of the divorce, the individual may experience a decrease in income and an increase in living expenses, which can be particularly challenging for those with disabilities who may require more resources to maintain their quality of life.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Depending on the type and severity of the disability, individuals with disabilities may face barriers in accessing necessary healthcare services, including specialized medical care, assistive technology, and home modifications. This can be particularly problematic for those who are recently divorced and may be facing financial constraints.
3. Social isolation: Divorce can lead to social isolation, which can be particularly challenging for individuals with disabilities who may rely on their spouse or partner for emotional support and social interaction.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a significant amount of stigma and discrimination against individuals with disabilities in many parts of the world. This can lead to feelings of shame, low self-esteem, and reduced opportunities for social inclusion.
5. Lack of support: As a result of the divorce, the individual may experience a lack of emotional and practical support, which can be particularly challenging for those with disabilities who may require ongoing care and assistance.
6. Increased stress and anxiety: Divorce can be a stressful and anxiety-provoking experience, particularly for individuals with disabilities who may face additional challenges in navigating the legal and emotional complexities of the divorce process.
7. Impact on mental health: The divorce process can have a significant impact on an individual's mental health, including increased levels of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This can be particularly challenging for individuals with disabilities who may already be experiencing mental health issues.
8. Difficulty in maintaining independence: Depending on the nature and severity of the disability, individuals may face challenges in maintaining their independence, including difficulties with daily living tasks, mobility, and accessing public transportation.
9. Limited access to education and employment
