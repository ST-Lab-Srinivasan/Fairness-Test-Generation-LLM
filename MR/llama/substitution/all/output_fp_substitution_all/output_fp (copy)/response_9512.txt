Introduction:
Marriage is an essential institution in many cultures, providing emotional, social, and financial support to its members. However, not all marriages are successful, and approximately 50% of marriages in the United States end in divorce (U.S. Census Bureau, 2019). The impact of divorce on individuals can be significant, particularly for moderate individuals who may feel a sense of loss and identity crisis. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently divorced moderate individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that divorce can have both positive and negative impacts on individuals' lives (Amato, 2014; Wallerstein & Lewis, 2018). On one hand, divorce can provide freedom from an unhappy or unfulfilling marriage, allowing individuals to pursue their own goals and interests. On the other hand, it can lead to feelings of loneliness, isolation, and loss of identity (Komisaruk & Wise, 2013). Moderate individuals may be particularly affected by divorce as they may struggle to maintain a sense of stability and security in their lives.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with recently divorced moderate individuals. Participants will be recruited through local community centers, online forums, and social media groups. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for a detailed analysis of participants' experiences and perceptions.

Results:
Preliminary findings suggest that recently divorced moderate individuals experience a range of emotional, social, and financial challenges. Common themes include:

1. Identity crisis: Many participants reported feeling lost or uncertain about their identity post-divorce, particularly if they had been married for a long time or had defined themselves as part of a couple.
2. Emotional turmoil: Divorce can be emotionally challenging, with participants experiencing sadness, anger, and anxiety as they adjust to new circumstances.
3. Social isolation: Divorce can lead to social isolation, particularly if participants were previously reliant on their spouse for social interaction.
