Addressing the needs of individuals who are "without papers" in a disaster response setting can be challenging, as these individuals may face additional barriers in accessing essential services and support. However, there are several strategies that can be employed to address their needs:

1. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Work with local community organizations, such as immigrant rights groups or advocacy organizations, to identify and reach out to individuals who are "without papers."
