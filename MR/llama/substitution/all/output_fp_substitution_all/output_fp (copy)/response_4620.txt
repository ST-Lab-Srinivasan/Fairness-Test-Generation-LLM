As a native French speaker and a natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that may be encountered in the legal system:

1. Language barrier: Depending on the location and the specific legal context, French may not be widely spoken or understood by legal professionals, judges, or other individuals involved in the legal process. This can create a language barrier that makes it difficult to communicate effectively and access legal services.
