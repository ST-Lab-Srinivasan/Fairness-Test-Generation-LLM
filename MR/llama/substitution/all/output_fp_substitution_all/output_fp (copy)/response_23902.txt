To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner French speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Create a survey or interview beginners and collect data on their experiences learning French, including challenges they face, their level of proficiency, and their motivations for learning the language. You could also ask them to rate their level of comfort with different aspects of the language, such as grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.
2. Analyze language learning data: Use existing datasets of language learners' progress and performance to identify patterns and trends in the difficulties that beginner French speakers face. For example, you could analyze data on the number of mistakes made by learners at different proficiency levels or compare the time it takes for learners to reach different levels of proficiency.
3. Use machine learning algorithms: Train machine learning models on datasets of language learners' progress and performance to identify patterns and trends in the difficulties that beginner French speakers face. For example, you could use a decision tree algorithm to identify the most common mistakes made by beginners or use a neural network to predict the level of proficiency a learner will reach based on their current level and learning history.
4. Create a language learning dashboard: Develop a web-based dashboard that allows learners to track their progress and provides insights into their strengths and weaknesses. The dashboard could include interactive tools, such as quizzes, games, and exercises, to help learners improve their skills.
5. Use sentiment analysis: Analyze text data from language learning forums, social media, or other online platforms to identify common issues and challenges faced by beginner French speakers. For example, you could use a sentiment analysis algorithm to analyze posts on a language learning forum and identify the most frequent complaints about grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation.
6. Conduct a case study: Select a small group of beginners and conduct in-depth interviews or observations to gather data on their experiences learning French. You could also collect data on their progress and performance over time to identify patterns and trends in the difficulties they face.
7. Use data visualization: Create visualizations of language learning data to help learners understand their progress and identify areas for improvement. For example, you
