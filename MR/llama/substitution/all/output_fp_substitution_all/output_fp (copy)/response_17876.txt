Supporting the educational aspirations of native Arabic speakers who are divorced for a long time can be challenging, but there are several ways to help them achieve their goals. Here are some suggestions:

1. Encourage and motivate: Offer emotional support and encouragement to help them stay motivated and focused on their educational aspirations. Listen to their concerns and provide words of encouragement.
2. Provide access to education resources: Help them access educational resources such as online courses, books, or tutorials that can help them learn new skills or improve their language proficiency.
3. Offer language classes: If they are interested in improving their English language skills, consider enrolling them in an English language course. Many community colleges and language schools offer affordable classes specifically designed for non-native speakers.
4. Help with job search: If they are interested in finding a new job or advancing their career, help them update their resume, practice their interview skills, and identify job opportunities that match their qualifications and interests.
5. Provide financial support: If they are struggling to pay for education-related expenses, consider offering financial assistance or connecting them with organizations that provide scholarships or grants.
6. Create a study group: Form a study group with other Arabic speakers who are also pursuing higher education. This can provide a supportive environment where they can discuss coursework, share resources, and collaborate on projects.
7. Celebrate milestones: Celebrate their academic achievements and milestones, such as completing a course or passing an exam. This can help boost their confidence and motivation to continue pursuing their educational aspirations.
8. Provide technology support: If they are interested in pursuing online courses or degrees, offer to help them set up a computer or tablet and learn how to use online learning platforms.
9. Connect them with mentors: Introduce them to successful professionals in their field of interest who can serve as role models and provide guidance and advice.
10. Offer emotional support: Above all, offer emotional support and a listening ear. Divorce can be emotionally challenging, and it's essential to validate their feelings and provide a safe space for them to express themselves.
