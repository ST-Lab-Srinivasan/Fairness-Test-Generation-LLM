Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Happy Newly Widowed Beginner Spanish Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who have recently experienced a major life change such as becoming a newly widowed beginner Spanish speaker. This paper aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of happy newly widowed beginner Spanish speakers and how they navigate their dual identities.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can significantly impact an individual's identity, particularly in the context of migration or cultural displacement (Haller, 2013). For example, immigrants often experience a sense of loss and dislocation due to the fragmentation of their identities upon arrival in a new country (Sidoli, 2015). Similarly, newly widowed individuals may struggle with maintaining their identity after losing a spouse, as they navigate a new reality without their partner (Klass, 1997).

Beginner Spanish speakers are also an important demographic to consider in this context. Language acquisition is a complex process that can significantly impact an individual's sense of self and identity (Kirkpatrick, 2017). As such, individuals who are learning a new language may experience a shift in their identities as they navigate the challenges and benefits of language acquisition.

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from happy newly widowed beginner Spanish speakers. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling, targeting individuals who had recently experienced the loss of their spouse and were actively learning Spanish. Interviews were conducted in person or via video conferencing, depending on participants' preferences.

Data Analysis:
Data analysis was informed by thematic analysis, which allowed for the identification of patterns and themes within the data (Braun & Clarke, 2013). Two main themes emerged from the data: (1) navigating dual identities and (2) the role of cultural heritage in shaping identity.

Findings:
The findings highlighted the complexity of navigating dual identities for happy newly widowed beginner Spanish speakers
