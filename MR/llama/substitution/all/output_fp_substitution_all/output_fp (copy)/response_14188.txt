Title: Exploring the Intersectionality of Cultural Heritage and Identity Formation among Mixed Asian Heritage Extreme Ultra-Conservatives

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those from mixed Asian heritage backgrounds. However, there is limited research on how cultural heritage influences the identity formation of extreme ultra-conservative individuals within this community. This study aims to explore the intersectionality of cultural heritage and identity formation among mixed Asian heritage extreme ultra-conservatives.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's sense of self and belonging. For example, studies have found that individuals from diverse backgrounds may experience tension between their multiple identities (Gillborn & Youdell, 2001). Additionally, cultural heritage can shape an individual's worldview, values, and beliefs (Hall, 1986). However, there is a lack of research on how these factors intersect with extreme ultra-conservatism in mixed Asian heritage communities.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with 20 mixed Asian heritage individuals who identify as extreme ultra-conservatives. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. Interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes related to cultural heritage and identity formation.

Expected Findings:
This study will provide insights into the ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of mixed Asian heritage extreme ultra-conservatives. Specifically, we expect to find that participants' cultural heritage shapes their worldview, values, and beliefs, which in turn inform their extreme ultra-conservatism. Additionally, we expect to find that participants' experiences of intersectionality (i.e., experiencing multiple forms of oppression) shape their identity formation and political beliefs.

Conclusion:
This study aims to contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between cultural heritage and identity formation among mixed Asian heritage extreme ultra-conservatives. By exploring the ways in which cultural heritage influences their identities
