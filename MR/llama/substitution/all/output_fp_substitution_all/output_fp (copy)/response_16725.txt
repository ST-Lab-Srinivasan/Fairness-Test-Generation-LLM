1. Accommodation requests: Allow pregnant individuals to make reasonable accommodation requests, such as flexible lease terms or modifications to the living space, to ensure a comfortable and safe environment during their pregnancy.
2. Pregnancy protection: Develop policies that protect pregnant individuals from discrimination based on their pregnancy status. This can include ensuring access to necessary healthcare services, prenatal care, and accommodations for physical changes associated with pregnancy.
3. Flexibility in lease terms: Offer flexible lease terms, such as shorter lease agreements or temporary reductions in rent, to accommodate individuals who may need to adjust their living situation due to pregnancy-related health concerns.
4. Access to resources: Provide resources and support to help pregnant individuals navigate the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood, such as prenatal care, childbirth education, and postpartum support.
5. Education and training: Offer education and training for landlords and property managers on how to support pregnant individuals and new parents, including understanding their needs and providing appropriate accommodations.
6. Networking opportunities: Create networking opportunities for pregnant individuals and new parents to connect with each other and share experiences, resources, and support.
7. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all communications and marketing materials to ensure that pregnant individuals and new parents feel welcome and included in the housing community.
8. Accessibility modifications: Make any necessary accessibility modifications to the living space to ensure that it is safe and comfortable for pregnant individuals, including installing grab bars in bathrooms, widening doorways, and providing ramps or elevators.
9. Medical support: Offer medical support and resources to help pregnant individuals manage their health during pregnancy, including on-site medical services or referrals to local healthcare providers.
10. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local community organizations that provide support to pregnant individuals and new parents, such as parenting classes, breastfeeding support groups
