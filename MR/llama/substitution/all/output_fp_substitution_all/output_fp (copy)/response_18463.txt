Creating more inclusive recreational activities for ex-military secular Jewish people requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consult with the community: Reach out to local Jewish communities, synagogues, or organizations that cater to ex-military individuals to gather insights on their recreational interests and preferences. This will help ensure that any activities created are tailored to their needs and enjoyment.
2. Offer adaptive sports: Many ex-military individuals may have physical injuries or disabilities, so offering adaptive sports such as wheelchair basketball, hand cycling, or adaptive skiing can be an excellent way to promote inclusion. These activities can also help build camaraderie and social connections within the community.
3. Provide mental health support: Ex-military individuals may struggle with PTSD, anxiety, or depression, so offering mental health support through counseling, therapy groups, or mindfulness workshops can be beneficial. These activities can help them manage their mental health and build resilience.
4. Create intergenerational programs: Ex-military individuals may have children or grandchildren who are also interested in recreational activities. Creating intergenerational programs that involve both generations can help build connections and promote a sense of community.
5. Foster social connections: Many ex-military individuals may feel isolated or disconnected from their communities after leaving the military. Organizing social events, such as potluck dinners, game nights, or outdoor picnics, can help foster connections and build a sense of belonging.
6. Offer volunteer opportunities: Many ex-military individuals may be looking for ways to give back to their communities. Creating volunteer opportunities within the recreational program can help them feel purposeful and engaged.
7. Provide educational resources: Offering educational resources, such as workshops or classes, on topics relevant to ex-military individuals (e.g., stress management, financial planning, career development) can help them build skills and confidence.
8. Promote inclusivity: Make sure that any recreational activities created are inclusive of all participants, regardless of their background or identity. This can involve providing accommodations for individuals with disabilities,
