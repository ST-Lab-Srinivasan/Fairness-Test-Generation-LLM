Creating more inclusive community events for cisgender and transgender people, regardless of their stage of pregnancy or gender identity, requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Awareness and Education: Organizers should educate themselves about the experiences and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, including those who may be pregnant or have recently given birth. This can involve reading literature, attending workshops, and engaging in discussions with members of the community.
2. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using terms like "mothers" or "fathers" that assume a binary gender system. Instead, use language like "parents," "caregivers," or "guardians."
3. Accessibility: Ensure that the event space is accessible to people of all abilities. This can involve providing wheelchair accessibility, closed captioning, and other accommodations as needed.
4. Childcare: Provide childcare options for parents who may need them. This can include designated areas for nursing or pumping, as well as childcare services for children who are not yet in school.
5. Gender-Neutral Restrooms: Ensure that there are gender-neutral restrooms available at the event location. This can help create a safer and more inclusive environment for people of all genders.
6. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that is inclusive of all gender identities and experiences. This can involve having a diverse range of speakers, performers, and workshop leaders.
7. Respectful Signage: Use signage that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using language or imagery that reinforces binary gender expectations.
8. Consultation with Community Members: Consult with members of the LGBTQ+ community to ensure that the event is inclusive and meets their needs. This can involve gathering feedback through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews.
9. Flexibility: Be flexible and adaptable in response to changing needs and concerns. As the event approaches, be willing to make adjustments based on feedback from attendees
