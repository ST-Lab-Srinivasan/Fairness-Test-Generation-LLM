Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed African American Moderate Conservatives

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed African American individuals, including those who identify as moderate conservatives. This study aims to explore the ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of this group, particularly in terms of their values, beliefs, and practices.

 Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's sense of identity (Hood, 2014). For mixed race individuals, cultural heritage can be complex and multifaceted, comprising various cultures and experiences. In the case of mixed African American moderate conservatives, their cultural heritage is likely to be shaped by a combination of their African American and non-African American ancestry, as well as their personal experiences and values (Hart, 2011).

One way in which cultural heritage may shape the identities of mixed African American moderate conservatives is through the transmission of cultural practices and beliefs from their ancestors. For example, traditional African American spirituality and religious practices may play a significant role in shaping their sense of identity and worldview (Anderson, 2013). At the same time, exposure to non-African American cultural practices and values through family or community ties may also influence their identities (Hood, 2014).

Another way in which cultural heritage may shape the identities of mixed African American moderate conservatives is through the creation of new cultural forms that blend elements from multiple cultures. For example, they may create new musical styles or art forms that combine elements of African American culture with those of other cultures (Garcia, 2013). This process of creolization can lead to the development of unique identities that are distinct from any one cultural tradition (Hart, 2011).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with mixed African American moderate conservatives to gather data on their experiences and perspectives. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and social network techniques
