As a genderqueer individual and an immigration attorney, I must acknowledge that green card holders, including equally transgender people, face various challenges in the US job market. Here are some of the common obstacles:

1. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against transgender individuals is still prevalent in the US job market. Green card holders may encounter discrimination based on their gender identity, which can limit their job opportunities and advancement.
2. Documentation issues: Green card holders must provide documentation to prove their immigration status. However, this process can be challenging for transgender individuals who may not have access to the correct documents or face difficulties in updating their legal documents to match their gender identity.
3. Visibility and stigma: Transgender individuals may experience social stigma and a lack of visibility in the job market, which can make it harder for them to find employment. This is especially true in industries or workplaces where there are few openly transgender people.
4. Job qualifications and requirements: Green card holders, including transgender individuals, may face challenges when applying for jobs that have specific requirements or qualifications that do not align with their gender identity. For example, some job postings may request a certain level of physical ability or appearance that may be difficult for transgender individuals to meet.
5. Lack of support: Transgender individuals may lack support from their employers, colleagues, and clients, which can lead to a hostile work environment and create additional challenges in the job market.
6. Healthcare access: Green card holders, including transgender individuals, may face difficulties accessing healthcare services due to barriers such as cost, lack of knowledge about available resources, or discrimination by healthcare providers. This can impact their overall well-being and ability to perform in the job market.
7. Limited career advancement: Transgender individuals may encounter limited career advancement opportunities due to discrimination, a lack of support, or other factors that hinder their ability to succeed professionally.
8. Financial instability: Green card holders, including transgender individuals, may experience financial instability due to various reasons such as difficulty finding employment, limited access to education and job training, or discrimination in the workplace.
