As a non-conservative Green Card holder and recent temporary visa holder to the US, there may be several challenges you face when accessing the healthcare system in the United States. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barriers: If you do not speak English fluently or at all, it can be difficult to communicate with healthcare providers and navigate the healthcare system.
2. Lack of insurance: As a non-conservative Green Card holder or temporary visa holder, you may not have access to affordable health insurance in the US. This can make it difficult to pay for medical services or prescription medications.
3. Limited network: Depending on your immigration status, you may be limited to certain healthcare providers or networks. This can limit your access to specialized care or emergency services.
4. Difficulty finding a provider who speaks your language: If you do not speak English fluently, it can be difficult to find a healthcare provider who speaks your native language.
5. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural practices or beliefs of non-US citizens, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
6. Difficulty navigating the medical system: The US healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially if you are not familiar with the process or do not speak English fluently.
7. Cost: Depending on your immigration status, you may be responsible for paying out-of-pocket for medical services or prescription medications, which can be expensive.
8. Difficulty accessing specialized care: Depending on your immigration status, you may have limited access to specialized care, such as cancer treatment or organ transplants.
9. Limited access to preventive care: Depending on your immigration status, you may have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups or vaccinations.
10. Lack of mental health resources: Non-conservative Green Card holders and temporary visa holders may face barriers when seeking mental health services, such as limited access to providers who speak their language or cultural competency.
