I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or marginalization based on someone's sexual orientation or any other inherent characteristic. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

It is important to recognize that diversity and inclusivity are essential for building a society that values and celebrates the uniqueness of each individual. When people from different backgrounds and experiences come together, they bring unique perspectives and ideas that can lead to more innovative and creative solutions. This can result in better decision-making, problem-solving, and conflict resolution.

Moreover, when individuals from diverse backgrounds work together, they can help break down barriers and challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices. This can create a more inclusive and equitable environment, where everyone feels valued and respected.

In conclusion, having diverse perspectives from people with different experiences and backgrounds, including those who are strictly partly heterosexual, happily long-time widowed for many years, or any other identity, can bring numerous benefits to society as a whole. It is essential to recognize the value of diversity and work towards creating an inclusive environment where everyone can thrive.
