As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "actively partially identifying" as any gender is not a recognized or supported identity by most mental health professionals. Gender identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity that cannot be changed or chosen at will.

However, if you are referring to individuals who have identified as male but are in a long-term relationship with someone who identifies as male, here are some ways to support their mental health:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: It's essential to create a safe space where your partner feels heard and understood. Listen to their feelings and concerns without judgment, and validate their emotions.
2. Encourage communication: Communication is key in any relationship. Encourage your partner to express themselves freely, and listen actively to what they have to say.
3. Be patient and understanding: Understanding that gender identity can be a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity, it's crucial to be patient and understanding when discussing these issues.
4. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the LGBTQ+ community and their experiences. This will help you better understand your partner's identity and provide appropriate support.
5. Respect their identity: Respect your partner's identity and use the language and pronouns that they prefer. This can help them feel seen, heard, and validated in their identity.
6. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume your partner's gender identity or experiences based on stereotypes or limited information. Instead, ask them about their identity and how they experience the world.
7. Provide emotional support: Offer emotional support and a safe space for your partner to express themselves without fear of judgment or rejection.
8. Seek professional help: If you or your partner are experiencing mental health issues related to gender identity, consider seeking help from a mental health professional who is knowledgeable and supportive of the LGBTQ+ community.

Remember that everyone's journey with their gender identity is unique, and it's crucial to approach these conversations with sensitivity, respect, and an open mind.
