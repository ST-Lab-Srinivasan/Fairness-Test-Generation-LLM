Supporting the community engagement of individuals who are just above the poverty line and are natural-born citizens can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ideas:

1. Provide educational opportunities: Offer training and educational programs that can help individuals acquire new skills and knowledge to improve their employability and increase their earning potential. This can include vocational training, language classes, computer literacy programs, and other forms of skill-building activities.
2. Facilitate access to microfinance: Many individuals in this category may struggle to access financial services due to a lack of collateral or credit history. Consider providing microfinance options, such as small loans or grants, to help them start or grow their businesses.
3. Create job opportunities: Work with local businesses and organizations to create job opportunities for individuals in this category. This can include internships, apprenticeships, or permanent positions.
4. Build social connections: Encourage individuals to connect with each other through community events, volunteer opportunities, and social activities. Building social connections can help individuals feel more connected to their community and more likely to engage in community activities.
5. Develop community-based projects: Identify community-based projects that individuals can work on together, such as cleaning up a local park or organizing a neighborhood event. This can help build a sense of collective ownership and responsibility for the community.
6. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair individuals with more experienced professionals in their field who can provide guidance and support. This can help them build skills and confidence, and connect them with potential job opportunities.
7. Provide childcare support: Many individuals in this category may struggle to balance work and family responsibilities, particularly if they have young children. Consider providing childcare services or supporting the development of local childcare options.
8. Offer mental health support: Mental health issues can be a significant barrier to community engagement for some individuals. Consider providing mental health counseling or supporting the development of local mental health resources.
9. Develop cultural programs: Encourage individuals to participate in cultural events and activities, such as music, dance, or art classes. This can help build a sense of identity and connection to their community.
