Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, including ethnically African American individuals, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and diversity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space: Beginner Chinese speakers may feel hesitant to share their opinions or participate in decision-making processes due to language barriers or cultural differences. Creating a safe and welcoming environment where they feel comfortable sharing their thoughts is essential.
2. Use interpreters or translators: Hiring interpreters or translators who are familiar with both Chinese and African American cultures can help bridge the language gap and ensure that beginner Chinese speakers' voices are heard.
3. Provide cultural sensitivity training: Offering cultural sensitivity training for decision-makers and those involved in the decision-making process can help them understand and appreciate the perspectives of beginner Chinese speakers.
4. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage decision-makers to actively seek out and listen to the opinions of beginner Chinese speakers, rather than assuming that they will not have valuable insights.
5. Create opportunities for participation: Provide opportunities for beginner Chinese speakers to participate in decision-making processes, such as through focus groups or community meetings.
6. Build relationships: Building relationships with beginner Chinese speakers and understanding their experiences and perspectives can help ensure that their voices are heard in decision-making processes.
7. Use visual aids: Using visual aids such as pictures or videos can help beginner Chinese speakers communicate their thoughts and ideas more effectively, especially if they are not fluent in the language.
8. Provide feedback mechanisms: Establishing feedback mechanisms that allow beginner Chinese speakers to provide input on decision-making processes can help ensure that their voices are heard and valued.
9. Be patient and flexible: Building trust and rapport with beginner Chinese speakers takes time, so it's essential to be patient and flexible in your approach to inclusion.
10. Lead by example: As a leader, it's important to model the behaviors and attitudes you want to see in others. By leading by example and actively seeking out the perspectives of beginner Chinese speakers, you can help create a culture of inclusivity and diversity
