Creating more inclusive public policies for non-disabled ethnic Hispanic individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and experiences of this community. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Involve the Community: Engage with ethnic Hispanic communities to understand their specific challenges and priorities. This can be done through community outreach, focus groups, and surveys. The insights gathered can inform policy decisions and ensure that policies are tailored to meet the needs of this community.
2. Address Language Barriers: Many ethnic Hispanics face language barriers, which can hinder their access to services and opportunities. Provide interpretation and translation services in public institutions, such as healthcare facilities, schools, and government offices. This can help ensure that individuals receive the support they need without facing language barriers.
3. Promote Cultural Competence: Train public servants and service providers on cultural competence to better understand and address the needs of ethnic Hispanic communities. This can involve education on the cultural practices, values, and beliefs of this community, as well as awareness of the historical and systemic barriers they face.
4. Advocate for Representation: Ensure that ethnic Hispanics are represented in decision-making positions, such as elected officials, policy makers, and service providers. This can help create policies that reflect the needs and experiences of this community.
5. Foster Inclusive Economic Opportunities: Provide access to economic opportunities, such as job training programs, small business loans, and entrepreneurship support. This can help ethnic Hispanics overcome economic barriers and achieve financial stability.
6. Address Health Disparities: Ethnic Hispanics face significant health disparities, including higher rates of chronic diseases and lower life expectancy compared to non-Hispanic whites. Implement policies that address these disparities, such as culturally sensitive healthcare services, outreach programs, and targeted interventions.
7. Support Education and Career Development: Provide access to quality education and career development opportunities for ethnic Hispanics. This can involve programs that support college access, vocational training, and mentorship opportunities.
8. Address Immigration-Related Issues
