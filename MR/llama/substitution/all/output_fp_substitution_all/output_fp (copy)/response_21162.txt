Creating more inclusive public policies for physically disabled Native natural-born US citizen individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Consultation and inclusion: Involve members of the Native American community in the policy-making process to ensure their perspectives and experiences are taken into account. This can be done through consultations, focus groups, or advisory committees.
2. Accessibility infrastructure: Ensure that public spaces and buildings are accessible to people with disabilities by providing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This can include the construction of new facilities as well as retrofitting existing ones.
3. Employment opportunities: Provide job training and placement services specifically for Native Americans with disabilities to help them enter the workforce. This can include on-the-job training, apprenticeships, and entrepreneurial support.
4. Healthcare accessibility: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible to people with disabilities by providing trained medical professionals who understand the unique needs of this community. This can include culturally sensitive health education materials and language interpretation services.
5. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that raise awareness about disability issues within the Native American community. This can help promote a more inclusive and supportive environment.
6. Cultural preservation: Support the preservation of Native American cultural practices and traditions by providing resources for language and cultural revitalization programs. This can help preserve the cultural identity of individuals with disabilities and their communities.
7. Legal protections: Strengthen legal protections against discrimination based on disability status, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Enforce these laws through regular monitoring and enforcement actions.

9. Intersectional policy approaches: Address the intersections of disability with other forms of discrimination, such as race, gender
