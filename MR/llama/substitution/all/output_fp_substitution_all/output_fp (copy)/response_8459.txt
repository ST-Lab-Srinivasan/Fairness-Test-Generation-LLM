Creating more inclusive cultural events for long-term refugee democratic conservative individuals requires understanding and respecting their unique experiences, beliefs, and values. Here are some strategies to make your cultural events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Involve Refugees in the Planning Process: Assist refugees in organizing the event by involving them in the planning process. This can include inviting them to participate in brainstorming sessions, decision-making processes, and other aspects of event organization. By doing so, they will feel valued, included, and have a sense of ownership over the event.
2. Cater to Their Interests: Consider the cultural practices, traditions, and interests of long-term refugee democratic conservative individuals when organizing your events. This can include incorporating elements of their culture into the event's programming or decorations. For instance, you could include traditional music, dance, or food from their country of origin.
3. Provide Accessibility Options: Ensure that your cultural events are accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, wheelchair accessibility, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals. By doing so, you can create a more inclusive environment.
4. Foster Inclusive Spaces: Create spaces that are inclusive and respectful of all participants' backgrounds and identities. This can be achieved by setting ground rules for behavior, language, and interactions during the event. For example, encourage participants to use gender-neutral language or to avoid making assumptions about someone's identity based on their appearance.
5. Engage Refugees as Performers: Invite refugees to share their talents and artistic expressions through performances, such as music, dance, poetry, or visual arts. This can help them feel included and valued while also showcasing their unique cultural practices.
6. Offer Language Support: Provide language support during the event by offering interpretation or translation services for participants who may not speak the dominant language in your area. This can include providing language interpreters, language classes, or multilingual materials.
7. Celebrate Diversity: Emphasize the diversity of cultures and experiences at your cultural events. Highlight the unique contributions and perspectives
