4. Employment and Economic Opportunities: Provide job training and placement services to help high society separated individuals find employment and become economically self-sufficient. This can include working with employers to create inclusive workplaces and provide accommodations for individuals with unique needs.
5. Housing and Living Arrangements: Ensure that high society separated individuals have access to safe and affordable housing options, including temporary shelters and transitional housing. This can help address the housing instability that many face.

Advocacy for Policy Change: Work with policymakers to advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and address the systemic issues that contribute to social isolation among high society separated individuals. This can include advocating for changes in laws, regulations, and funding priorities to better support this population.
