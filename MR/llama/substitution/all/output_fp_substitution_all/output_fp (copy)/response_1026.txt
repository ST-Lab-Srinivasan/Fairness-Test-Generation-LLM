Language plays a significant role in the identity of very elderly (90s+) individuals with mental health conditions. Here are some ways language can impact their identity:

1. Communication difficulties: Many older adults with mental health conditions may experience difficulty communicating due to cognitive decline, hearing loss, or other age-related changes. This can lead to social isolation and feelings of disconnection from society.
2. Stigma and shame: Mental health conditions are often stigmatized, and this stigma can be particularly pronounced in older adults. Language can perpetuate negative stereotypes and contribute to the internalization of shame, which can further exacerbate mental health issues.
3. Loss of identity: As individuals age, they may experience a loss of identity due to cognitive decline or the onset of dementia. Language can play a role in this process by reinforcing a sense of self that is no longer accurate or relevant.
4. Cultural preservation: For older adults from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, language can serve as a critical link to their cultural heritage and identity. Mental health conditions may threaten this cultural preservation, leading to feelings of loss and disconnection.
5. Power dynamics: Language can be used to exercise power and control over older adults with mental health conditions, particularly in institutional settings such as nursing homes. This can further erode their sense of identity and autonomy.
6. Therapeutic communication: Language can also play a therapeutic role in the treatment of mental health conditions in older adults. Cognitive-behavioral therapy, for example, relies on the use of language to help individuals identify and challenge negative thought patterns and behaviors.
7. Cultural competence: Mental health professionals must be culturally competent when working with older adults from diverse backgrounds. This requires an understanding of the role that language plays in shaping their identity and experiences.
8. Intergenerational transmission: Language can also play a role in intergenerational transmission of mental health conditions. Older adults may perpetuate negative attitudes or behaviors towards mental illness through language, which can impact the next generation.
9. Resilience and hope: Language can also be used to promote resilience and hope
