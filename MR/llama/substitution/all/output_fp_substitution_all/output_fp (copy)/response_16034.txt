High earners without papers (HEWPs) face significant challenges within the healthcare system. These individuals are undocumented immigrants who have been living and working in a particular country for an extended period but lack legal documentation. Here are some of the common challenges HEWPs encounter when seeking medical care:

1. Difficulty accessing healthcare services: HEWPs may be reluctant to seek medical attention due to fear of deportation or being reported to immigration authorities. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, exacerbating their health issues.
2. Language barriers: Many HEWPs may not speak the dominant language in the country they are living in, making it challenging for them to communicate with healthcare providers and navigate the healthcare system.
3. Limited cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the specific cultural beliefs and practices of HEWPs, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnosis.
4. Cost and financial barriers: HEWPs often face financial difficulties due to their immigration status, making it challenging for them to afford medical care, including prescription medications and copays.
5. Limited access to specialized care: HEWPs may have difficulty accessing specialized care, such as dental or mental health services, due to language barriers or a lack of knowledge about available resources.
6. Fear of data sharing: HEWPs may be hesitant to share personal information, including medical history, with healthcare providers due to concerns about data privacy and immigration status.
7. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: HEWPs may find it challenging to navigate the complex healthcare system, including understanding insurance options, billing processes, and accessing preventive care.
8. Lack of continuity of care: Due to their immigration status, HEWPs may have difficulty establishing a relationship with a primary care provider, leading to a lack of continuity of care and poor health outcomes.
9. Stigma and discrimination: HEWPs may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers, which can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment and make it harder for them to seek medical attention.
10. Legal barriers: HEWPs may be prohibited
