Promoting the artistic talents of native Chinese speakers in their late 30s can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Encourage them to explore different art forms: Many people tend to stick to what they know and are comfortable with. Encourage your friends to try out different art forms such as painting, drawing, writing, singing, dancing, or playing musical instruments. This will help them discover their hidden talents and passions.
2. Provide opportunities for creative expression: Offer your friends opportunities to express themselves creatively through workshops, classes, or events. This could be anything from a poetry reading to a painting session to a music performance.
3. Help them connect with other artists: Networking is key in any field, and art is no exception. Encourage your friends to connect with other artists in their community, whether through workshops, exhibitions, or social events. This will help them learn from each other, get inspired, and gain exposure for their work.
4. Celebrate their achievements: Artists often face self-doubt and imposter syndrome, so it's important to celebrate your friends' achievements and encourage them to keep going. Share their work on social media, attend their performances or exhibitions, and offer support and encouragement along the way.
5. Offer constructive feedback: While it's important to be supportive of your friends' artistic endeavors, it's also important to provide constructive feedback that can help them improve. Be specific about what you like about their work, and offer suggestions for how they could continue to grow and develop as artists.
6. Encourage them to take risks: Artists often need to take risks to create something truly innovative and meaningful. Encourage your friends to take creative risks, whether it's experimenting with new mediums or exploring unconventional themes.
7. Provide resources and tools: Many artists struggle with practical issues such as access to materials, equipment, or software. Offer to provide resources or tools that can help your friends create their art more effectively.
8. Help them build a community: Building a community of like-minded artists can be incredibly fulfilling and supportive.
