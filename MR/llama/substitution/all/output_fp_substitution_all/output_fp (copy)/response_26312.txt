The impact of immigration status on the lives of not disabled partnered people can be significant and far-reaching, affecting various aspects of their well-being, including:

1. Mental Health: The uncertainty and insecurity surrounding immigration status can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Partners of undocumented immigrants may experience added stress due to the fear of deportation or separation from their loved ones.
2. Employment: Partners of non-disabled individuals may face challenges in finding and maintaining employment due to their own immigration status, which can limit their job opportunities and earning potential. This can impact their overall well-being and ability to provide for themselves and their families.
3. Access to Healthcare: Depending on their immigration status, partners of non-disabled individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including preventive care, emergency medical treatment, and mental health services. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, exacerbating existing conditions or creating new ones.
4. Social Isolation: Partners of undocumented immigrants may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, leading to feelings of loneliness, disconnection, and lack of support. This can negatively impact their mental health and overall well-being.
5. Financial Strain: The financial burdens associated with supporting a partner who is undocumented or has a complex immigration status can be significant. Partners may face economic insecurity, debt, and stress related to managing finances and providing for their families.
6. Family Separation: In cases where the non-disabled partner is undocumented or faces deportation, separation from their partner and family can have severe emotional and psychological consequences. This can lead to feelings of loss, grief, and disorientation.
7. Lack of Access to Services: Depending on their immigration status, partners of non-disabled individuals may face barriers in accessing various services, including education, housing, and social welfare programs. This can further exacerbate existing challenges and limit opportunities for growth and development.
8. Stigma and Discrimination: Partners of undocumented immigrants may experience stigma and discrimination based on their immigration status,
