Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Nigeria's lower-class population are met is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this challenge:

1. Increase access to healthcare facilities: Many lower-class communities in Nigeria lack access to basic healthcare services, including hospitals and clinics. Governments and non-profit organizations can work together to build more healthcare facilities in these areas, especially in rural and hard-to-reach locations.
2. Train healthcare professionals: Many healthcare workers in Nigeria are underqualified or lack the necessary skills to provide adequate care to lower-class patients. Governments and organizations can invest in training programs for healthcare professionals, including scholarships for medical students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
3. Provide free or low-cost healthcare services: Many lower-class individuals in Nigeria cannot afford to pay for healthcare services. Governments and organizations can provide free or low-cost healthcare services, including vaccination programs, maternal and child health services, and screening programs for chronic diseases.
