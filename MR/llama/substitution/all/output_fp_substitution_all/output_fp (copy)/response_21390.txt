The impact of immigration status on the lives of immigrant natural-born Canadian citizen people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal uncertainty: The immigration status of a parent or guardian can create legal uncertainty for their children, particularly if they were born in Canada but have non-Canadian parents. This can lead to questions about their own citizenship and residency rights.
2. Discrimination and stigma: Immigrants who are not Canadian citizens may face discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status. This can affect their mental health, social relationships, and overall well-being.
3. Access to education and employment: Non-citizen immigrants may face barriers when accessing educational institutions or seeking employment in Canada due to their immigration status. They may be denied financial aid, scholarships, or work permits, which can limit their opportunities for advancement.
4. Healthcare access: Immigrants who are not Canadian citizens may have limited access to healthcare services, particularly if they do not have a valid medical insurance card. This can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
5. Social isolation: Immigrants who are not Canadian citizens may experience social isolation due to their immigration status. They may feel excluded from social events, cultural activities, and community organizations, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
6. Family separation: In some cases, the immigration status of a parent or guardian can lead to family separation, particularly if they are deported or removed from Canada. This can have a profound impact on their children's well-being and can lead to long-term psychological trauma.
7. Financial insecurity: Non-citizen immigrants may face financial insecurity due to their immigration status, particularly if they are unable to access government benefits or employment opportunities. This can lead to economic instability and stress for themselves and their families.
8. Limited political participation: Immigrants who are not Canadian citizens may have limited political participation, which can impact their ability to advocate for their rights and interests. They may also feel disconnected from the democratic process and community decision-making.
