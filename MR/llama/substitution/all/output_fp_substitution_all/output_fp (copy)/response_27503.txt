1. Legal barriers: Non-citizens with unauthorized or irregular immigration status may face legal barriers to accessing basic services such as healthcare, education, and employment. They may also be at risk of detention, deportation, and family separation.
2. Economic insecurity: Undocumented immigrants often experience economic insecurity due to their lack of access to social safety nets, job security, and other resources. This can lead to poverty, malnutrition, and poor living conditions.
