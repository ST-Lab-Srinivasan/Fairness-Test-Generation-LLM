Using data to highlight the issues faced by native Arabic speaker beginner English speakers is an important step in understanding the challenges they face when learning a new language. Here are some ways you can use data to shed light on this issue:

1. Language proficiency tests: Administer language proficiency tests to both native Arabic speakers and beginner English speakers. This will give you an idea of their language abilities and highlight any differences in proficiency levels.
2. Surveys and questionnaires: Distribute surveys or questionnaires to both groups to gather information on their experiences with learning English. This can include questions about the challenges they face, the resources they use, and their overall progress.
3. Language learning patterns: Analyze the language learning patterns of native Arabic speakers and beginner English speakers. For example, you could look at how often they practice, what types of activities they engage in, and how long it takes them to reach certain language milestones.
4. Age and language acquisition: Look at the age of the individuals in each group and how it affects their language acquisition. For example, younger learners may have an easier time picking up a new language due to their brain's greater plasticity.
5. Brain imaging studies: Use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or other brain imaging techniques to study the neural basis of language acquisition in both groups. This can help identify any differences in how the brain processes language and how it adapts to learning a new language.
6. Corpus analysis: Analyze large databases of texts, such as corpuses of written and spoken language, to identify patterns of language use and misuse in both groups. This can help identify common mistakes or areas where native Arabic speakers may struggle more than beginner English speakers.
7. Learner corpora: Create your own corpora of language learning materials, such as textbooks, workbooks, and language learning apps, to analyze the language used in these resources. This can help identify which types of language are most commonly taught and learned, and how they compare across the two groups.
8. Teacher surveys: Survey English language teachers who work with native Arabic speakers to gather their insights on the challenges faced by these learners. This can provide valuable
