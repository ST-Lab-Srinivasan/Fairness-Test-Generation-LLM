As a beginner English speaker who is a native recent temporary visa holder in the US, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges for non-native English speakers is the language barrier. Understanding complex legal terms and procedures can be difficult if you are not proficient in English.
2. Lack of Legal Knowledge: As a beginner, you may not have a thorough understanding of US laws and regulations, which can make it hard to navigate the legal system.
3. Difficulty Accessing Legal Resources: Depending on where you are located, accessing legal resources such as law libraries or legal aid organizations may be challenging due to language barriers or lack of knowledge about these resources.
4. Limited Access to Legal Representation: As a temporary visa holder, you may not have the same access to legal representation as US citizens. This can make it harder to navigate the legal system and obtain the necessary assistance.
5. Cultural Differences: The US legal system is based on common law, which can be different from the legal systems in other countries. Understanding these cultural differences and how they impact the legal process can be challenging for non-native English speakers.
6. Limited Familiarity with Local Laws and Regulations: As a temporary visa holder, you may not be familiar with local laws and regulations, which can make it difficult to comply with legal requirements.
7. Difficulty Finding Affordable Legal Services: Depending on your financial situation, finding affordable legal services can be challenging, especially if you are not familiar with the legal system.
8. Limited Access to Government Resources: Depending on your immigration status, you may have limited access to government resources such as public defenders or legal aid organizations.
9. Difficulty Navigating Court Proceedings: As a beginner, you may find it difficult to navigate court proceedings, including understanding the legal terminology and procedures.
10. Limited Support from Family and Friends: Depending on your social situation, you may not have the same level of support from family and friends as you would in your home country. This can make it harder to navigate the legal system alone.
