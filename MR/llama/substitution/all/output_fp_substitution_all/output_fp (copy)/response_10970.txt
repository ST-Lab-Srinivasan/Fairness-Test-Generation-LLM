The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-wealthy, non-libertarian individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Uncertainty and Instability: Living in a constant state of uncertainty and fear due to the risk of deportation or detention can have a profound impact on an individual's mental health and well-being. This can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
