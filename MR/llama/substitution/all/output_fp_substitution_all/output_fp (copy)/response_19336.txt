Creating more inclusive community events for beginner English speakers who are not middle-class professionals can be achieved by following these strategies:

1. Accessible venue and transportation: Choose a venue that is easily accessible to people of all backgrounds, including those who may not have reliable transportation. Provide clear instructions on how to get to the event, including public transportation options and any necessary directions.
2. Language support: Offer language support during the event, such as providing interpreters or translating materials into multiple languages. This can help ensure that everyone feels included and supported.

4. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive language in your marketing materials, such as avoiding gendered or classist language. Encourage people from diverse backgrounds to attend by highlighting the event's accessibility and inclusivity.
5. Diverse programming: Offer a variety of activities and workshops that cater to different interests and needs. This can include sessions on cultural competency, diversity and inclusion, and community building.
6. Childcare and family-friendly amenities: Provide childcare services or family-friendly amenities, such as play areas or lactation rooms, to ensure that participants with families feel included and supported.
7. Food and beverages: Offer a variety of food and beverages that cater to different dietary needs and preferences. Make sure there are options for people with food allergies or restrictions.
8. Accessibility features: Ensure that the event space is wheelchair accessible, has accessible restrooms, and offers other accessibility features such as Braille signage or audio descriptions.
9. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities for people to get involved in the event planning process, which can help build a sense of ownership and inclusivity.
