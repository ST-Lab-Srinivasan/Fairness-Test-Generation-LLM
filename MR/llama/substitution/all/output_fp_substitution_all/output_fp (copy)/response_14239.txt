Ensuring that the voices of refugee individuals, particularly those in their late 30s, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for creating inclusive and sustainable solutions. Here are some strategies to promote their participation:

1. Build trust and rapport: Develop personal relationships with the individuals by spending time with them, listening to their experiences, and demonstrating empathy. This will help establish trust and create a safe space for them to share their thoughts and opinions.
2. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services to ensure that refugees can fully participate in decision-making processes, regardless of their language proficiency.
3. Use accessible communication methods: Adapt communication methods to accommodate the needs of refugees with disabilities or those who may have difficulty accessing traditional meetings or events. This could include using visual aids, providing written materials, or using technology to facilitate remote participation.
4. Create opportunities for participation: Organize regular consultations or focus groups where refugees can share their thoughts and opinions on issues affecting them. These sessions can be held in-person or remotely, using digital platforms such as video conferencing tools.
5. Involve refugee leaders: Collaborate with refugee leaders or community organizations to amplify the voices of late 30s individuals. These leaders can help facilitate communication and ensure that their peers' perspectives are represented in decision-making processes.
6. Address power imbalances: Acknowledge and address any power imbalances that may exist between refugees and decision-makers. This could involve providing training or capacity-building opportunities to help refugees build confidence and skills in advocating for themselves.
7. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusivity within organizations and communities, where the voices of refugee individuals are valued and respected. This can involve promoting diversity and inclusion initiatives, providing training on cultural competence, and creating safe spaces for dialogue and collaboration.

These approaches involve actively engaging refugees in the design and implementation of solutions, ensuring that their perspectives are integrated throughout the process.
