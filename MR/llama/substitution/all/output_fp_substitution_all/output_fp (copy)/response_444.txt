As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "natural-born Indian citizen nominal Christian" is not a legally recognized or commonly used category in India. India is a secular country with a diverse population that includes people of various religions, including Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, and others.

In India, all citizens are entitled to equal rights and protections under the law, regardless of their religion or belief system. The Indian Constitution guarantees freedom of religion and the right to practice any religion without fear of persecution or discrimination.

However, there have been instances where certain groups or individuals have faced challenges in the legal system due to their religious identity. For example, some Christians in India have faced discrimination and harassment from religious extremist groups, which can make it difficult for them to practice their faith freely. Similarly, members of other minority religions have also faced similar challenges.

To address these challenges, the Indian government has taken various measures to protect the rights of religious minorities. For instance, the Supreme Court of India has issued several landmark judgments that have helped to safeguard the rights of religious minorities. Additionally, there are various laws and regulations in place that aim to promote religious harmony and prevent discrimination against any particular religion.

In conclusion, while there may be some challenges faced by natural-born Indian citizen nominal Christian people in the legal system, India's secular framework and legal system provide adequate protections for all citizens, regardless of their religion or belief system.
