Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American recent temporary visa holders to the US and nominal Christian individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the shared knowledge, traditions, beliefs, values, and practices that are passed down from generation to generation within a particular group or society. For Native American communities, cultural heritage includes their historical and traditional ways of life, such as their languages, rituals, ceremonies, art, music, and other expressive forms.

For recent temporary visa holders to the US who identify as Native American, their cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and connection to their ancestors and community. It can also serve as a source of strength and resilience in the face of adversity. For example, traditional ceremonies and rituals can provide a sense of grounding and connection to the land, people, and ancestors, which can be particularly important for individuals who may be experiencing cultural shock or disorientation in a new country.

Additionally, cultural heritage can shape the identities of nominal Christian individuals by providing a framework for understanding their spiritual beliefs and practices. For example, traditional religious ceremonies and rituals can serve as a means of connecting with the divine and expressing devotion, which can be particularly important for individuals who may be experiencing spiritual disorientation or confusion in a new cultural context.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage can also be complex and multifaceted, and may not always fit neatly into categories of identity. For example, some Native American communities may identify as both Christian and traditional, incorporating elements of both cultures into their daily lives. Similarly, some individuals may identify as both Native American and nominal Christian, blending elements of both cultures to create a unique sense of self.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American recent temporary visa holders to the US and nominal Christian individuals. It provides a source of strength, resilience, and connection to community and ancestors, and can shape individual identities through the incorporation of traditional practices and beliefs into daily life.
