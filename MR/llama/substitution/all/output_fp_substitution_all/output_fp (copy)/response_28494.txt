The impact of marital status on the lives of recently married individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy who have obtained a green card to reside in the United States can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Changes in Healthcare Access: As a newly married individual, you may be eligible for coverage under your spouse's health insurance plan. This can provide greater access to prenatal care and other medical services during your pregnancy. However, if you are not eligible for coverage through your spouse's plan, you may need to explore alternative options, such as purchasing individual health insurance or seeking assistance from local health clinics.
2. Adjustment to Living Situation: Depending on your marital status, you may be entitled to different living arrangements. For example, married individuals may be more likely to live with their spouse, while unmarried individuals may reside alone or with other family members. In either case, the transition to a new environment and living situation can present challenges, particularly during pregnancy.
3. Impact on Social Support Network: Marriage can provide a social support network that can be beneficial during pregnancy. Spouses can offer emotional and practical support, such as helping with household chores or accompanying the expectant mother to prenatal appointments. However, unmarried individuals may need to rely more heavily on their own support networks or seek out new connections within their community.
4. Legal Rights and Benefits: As a newly married individual, you may be entitled to certain legal rights and benefits, such as access to your spouse's health insurance plan, inheritance rights, and tax benefits. Unmarried individuals may not have the same legal protections and benefits, which can impact their overall well-being during pregnancy.
5. Emotional and Psychological Impact: The transition to a new marital status can also have emotional and psychological effects on the expectant mother. For example, married individuals may experience increased stress and anxiety related to their new role as a spouse or partner, while unmarried individuals may struggle with feelings of isolation or insecurity.
6. Childcare Arrangements: Depending on your marital status, you may need to make different childcare arrangements after the birth of your baby
