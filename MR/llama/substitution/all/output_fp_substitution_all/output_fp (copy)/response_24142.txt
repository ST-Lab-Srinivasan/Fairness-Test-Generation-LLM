As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the term "devout Muslim" is not a protected class under US law. Therefore, there is no explicit legal protection for individuals based solely on their religious beliefs or practices. However, US law does provide some protections for religious freedom and expression, which may be relevant to individuals who are permanent residents and devout Muslims.

Here are some potential challenges that permanent resident devout Muslims might face in the legal system:

1. Discrimination: Devout Muslims may face discrimination in various areas of life, including employment, education, housing, and public accommodations. While federal and state anti-discrimination laws prohibit discrimination based on race, gender, religion, and other characteristics, enforcement can be inconsistent or insufficient.
2. Security screenings: As a Muslim, you may face additional security screenings at airports or other transportation hubs. While these screenings are intended to ensure national security, they can also create an uneasy experience for individuals based on their religion or ethnicity.
3. Surveillance and monitoring: Devout Muslims may be subject to surveillance or monitoring by law enforcement agencies, particularly in the aftermath of terrorist attacks or other security concerns. While these measures are intended to prevent harm, they can also create a climate of fear and mistrust.
4. Lack of representation: Devout Muslims may face barriers to accessing legal services or advocacy due to language barriers, cultural differences, or discrimination by service providers. This can limit their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
5. Stigma and stereotyping: Devout Muslims may face stigma or stereotyping in the legal system, particularly if they are perceived as a threat to national security or social norms. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and reinforce harmful stereotypes.
6. Difficulty interpreting religious practices: Devout Muslims may face challenges when trying to incorporate their religious practices into legal proceedings, such as court appearances or testimony. For example, they may need to find a way to observe their prayer times without disrupting the legal process.
7. Lack of understanding about Islam
