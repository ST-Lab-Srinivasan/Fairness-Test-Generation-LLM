1. Cultural sensitivity training for healthcare providers: Provide cultural sensitivity training for healthcare providers to understand the beliefs, values, and practices of Arabic speakers. This can help them provide more effective care and address any cultural barriers that may exist.

Access to interpreters and translators: Ensure that there are adequate resources available for interpretation and translation services, particularly for Arabic-speaking patients who may not speak English or French fluently.
