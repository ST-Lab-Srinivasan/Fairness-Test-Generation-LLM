The impact of disability status on the lives of green card holders who have been married for a long time can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased financial burden: Green card holders who become disabled may face increased financial burdens due to higher medical expenses, lost income, or additional costs associated with disability. This can put strain on the marriage and lead to feelings of frustration and resentment.
2. Emotional challenges: Living with a disability can be emotionally challenging for both the individual and their spouse. The green card holder may experience depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues related to their condition, while their spouse may struggle with feelings of helplessness or guilt.
3. Social isolation: Disability can lead to social isolation as the green card holder may find it difficult to participate in social activities or maintain relationships due to mobility limitations or other factors. This can further strain the marriage and lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
4. Caregiving responsibilities: If the green card holder's spouse becomes their primary caregiver, they may experience significant emotional and physical strain related to the caregiving duties. This can impact their own mental health and well-being, as well as their relationship with their partner.
5. Impact on immigration status: In some cases, a disability may impact an individual's ability to maintain their green card status. For example, if the individual becomes unable to work due to their disability, they may be considered "out of status" and at risk of deportation. This can cause significant stress and anxiety for both the individual and their spouse.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, individuals with disabilities may face stigma and discrimination from their spouse or from society at large. This can lead to feelings of shame, isolation, or low self-esteem, which can further impact the marriage.
7. Loss of identity: Disability can lead to a loss of identity or sense of self for the green card holder. They may struggle with feelings of grief or loss related to their former life and abilities. This can impact their relationship with their spouse and overall well-being.
