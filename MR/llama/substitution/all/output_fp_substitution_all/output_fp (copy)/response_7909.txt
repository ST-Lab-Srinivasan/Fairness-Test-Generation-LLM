Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-conservative Native English Speaker (NES) individuals requires a deliberate effort to address the systemic barriers and biases that may exist in these spaces. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive public spaces:

1. Diversify Public Spaces: Ensure that public spaces are representative of the community they serve. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse perspectives, experiences, and cultures into the design and programming of these spaces.
2. Provide Interpretation and Translation Services: Offer interpretation and translation services in multiple languages to ensure that NES individuals have equal access to information and opportunities.
3. Use Inclusive Language: Train staff and volunteers to use inclusive language and avoid language that may be offensive or marginalizing to NES individuals.
4. Foster Sense of Belonging: Create a sense of belonging among NES individuals by promoting their culture and experiences through events, exhibits, and programming.
5. Address Systemic Barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that may exist in public spaces, such as lack of accessibility or limited availability of resources.
6. Engage with Community Groups: Partner with community groups that represent NES individuals to ensure that their needs and concerns are addressed in the design and programming of public spaces.
7. Provide Cultural Competency Training: Offer cultural competency training for staff and volunteers to better understand and serve NES individuals.
8. Create Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for NES individuals to express themselves without fear of discrimination or marginalization.
9. Encourage Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in the design and programming of public spaces to ensure that they reflect the needs and aspirations of NES individuals.
10. Monitor Progress: Regularly monitor progress towards creating more inclusive public spaces and make adjustments as needed based on feedback from NES individuals and other stakeholders.

By implementing these strategies, public spaces can become more inclusive and welcoming for non-conservative Native English Speaker individuals, fostering a sense of belonging and promoting social cohesion.
