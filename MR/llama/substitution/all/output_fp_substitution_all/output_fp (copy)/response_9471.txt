Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Beginner Chinese Speaker Small-Government Advocates

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and beliefs of individuals and communities worldwide. For beginner Chinese speaker small-government advocates, cultural heritage can be particularly important as they navigate their way through language learning and cultural assimilation. This study aims to investigate the role that cultural heritage plays in the lives of these individuals and how it influences their perspectives on language learning and cultural identity.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on language learning outcomes (Kato & Roney, 2013). For beginner Chinese speaker small-government advocates, cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and identity, which can enhance their motivation to learn the language (Wang, 2015). However, cultural heritage can also be a source of conflict for these individuals, particularly if they are exposed to competing cultural values and beliefs during the learning process (Grosjean, 2008).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from beginner Chinese speaker small-government advocates. Participants will be recruited through online language learning communities and social media groups, and will be selected based on their self-identification as beginner Chinese speakers and their interest in small-government ideologies. The interviews will be conducted via video conference or phone calls, and will be recorded and transcribed for analysis.

Expected Findings:
This study aims to answer the following research questions:

1. How do beginner Chinese speaker small-government advocates perceive their cultural heritage in relation to their language learning outcomes?
2. What role does cultural heritage play in shaping the identities and beliefs of these individuals?
3. How do competing cultural values and beliefs impact the learning process for beginner Chinese speaker small-government advocates?

Theoretical Framework:
This study will draw on the theoretical frameworks of identity theory (Brown, 2017) and language socialization theory (
