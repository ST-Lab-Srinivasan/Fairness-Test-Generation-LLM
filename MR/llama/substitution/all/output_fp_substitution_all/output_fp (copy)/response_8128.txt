As a non-liberal green card holder natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that you may face in the US healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Limited access to healthcare: As a non-liberal green card holder, you may not be eligible for certain government-funded healthcare programs such as Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). This can make it difficult to afford healthcare, especially if you have a pre-existing condition.
2. High costs: Even if you have health insurance, the cost of medical care in the US can be prohibitively expensive. Many non-liberal green card holders may struggle to pay for medical expenses, including copays, deductibles, and coinsurance.
3. Language barriers: If you are not fluent in English, you may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers or understanding your treatment options.
4. Cultural barriers: As a non-liberal green card holder, you may experience cultural barriers when seeking medical care. For example, you may be more likely to seek care from providers who share your cultural background or speak your native language.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or immigration status is still prevalent in the US healthcare system. You may face discrimination when seeking medical care, which can lead to delays or denials of care.
6. Difficulty accessing specialized care: Depending on your location and insurance coverage, you may have difficulty accessing specialized care or seeing a specialist. This can be particularly challenging if you have a rare condition or need ongoing treatment.
7. Limited access to mental health services: Mental health services can be scarce in some areas, especially for non-liberal green card holders who may not have access to the same level of care as US citizens.
8. Cost of prescription medications: The cost of prescription medications can be high, and non-liberal green card holders may struggle to afford them.
9. Limited knowledge of healthcare options: As a non-liberal green card holder, you may not be familiar with the full range of healthcare
