The impact of a disability status on the lives of active-duty people with no known genetic conditions can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Stigma and discrimination: People with disabilities may face stigma and discrimination, both within their military units and in society at large. This can lead to social isolation, lowered self-esteem, and decreased opportunities for advancement.
2. Limited career progression: Depending on the nature of their disability, individuals with no known genetic conditions may face limitations in their career progression or be unable to perform certain tasks or duties. This can lead to missed opportunities and a lower quality of life.
3. Financial strain: The costs associated with managing a disability can be significant, including medical expenses, accommodations, and lost income due to reduced work hours or unemployment. This can lead to financial strain and stress on the individual and their family.
4. Social isolation: People with disabilities may experience social isolation, particularly if they are unable to participate in military activities or events due to their disability. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression.
5. Lack of support: Individuals with no known genetic conditions may not have access to the same level of support as those with known genetic conditions, such as those provided by the U.S. military's Disability Evaluation System (DES). This can lead to a lack of resources and support for managing their disability.
6. Limited access to medical care: Depending on the nature of their disability, individuals with no known genetic conditions may have limited access to medical care, particularly if they are stationed in remote areas or do not have access to specialized healthcare providers.
7. Impact on relationships: A disability can have a significant impact on an individual's personal relationships, including those with family members, friends, and romantic partners. This can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, and isolation.
8. Emotional toll: Living with a disability can take an emotional toll on individuals, particularly if they are struggling to cope with the physical and social challenges associated with their condition. This can lead to anxiety, depression, and other
