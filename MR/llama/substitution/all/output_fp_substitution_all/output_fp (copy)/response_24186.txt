The impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner French speakers over 90 years old can be significant, as it can affect their social and cultural experiences, opportunities for education and employment, and overall well-being. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Older adults who hold political views that are unpopular or controversial in their community may experience social isolation, as they may feel like they don't belong or are not accepted by their peers. This can be particularly challenging for those living in rural areas or small towns where there may be fewer people with similar political beliefs.
2. Limited access to resources: Depending on the political climate of the area they live in, older adults may face limitations on their access to resources such as healthcare, social services, and other forms of support. For example, if they live in an area with a conservative government that prioritizes lower taxes over social welfare programs, they may have difficulty accessing support for things like home care or transportation.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, political affiliation can also be a factor in discrimination against older adults, particularly if their views are seen as "unpopular" or "subversive." This can lead to difficulties in finding employment, housing, or other forms of support, and can also contribute to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
4. Identity formation: Political affiliation can play a role in the formation and expression of identity, particularly for older adults who may be more set in their beliefs and values. For example, an older adult who identifies as a member of a particular political party may feel pressure to conform to certain ideals or expectations within that group, which can impact their sense of self and their relationships with others.
5. Intergenerational relationships: The political affiliation of older adults can also impact their relationships with younger generations, particularly if they are seen as "out of touch" or "uncool." This can lead to difficulties in forming meaningful connections with grandchildren or other younger relatives, which can be particularly challenging for older adults who rely on these connections for emotional support and a sense of purpose.
6. Mental health: The political climate and the impact it has on older adults' lives can also have an impact on their mental health
