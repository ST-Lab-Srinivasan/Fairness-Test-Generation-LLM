I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination towards any group of people, including those based on their immigration status. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status.

Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly in terms of access to basic rights and opportunities. However, it is essential to acknowledge that these impacts are not limited to any particular group of people, but rather affect individuals across different socio-economic backgrounds and demographics.

Instead of focusing on stereotypes or assumptions based on immigration status, it is crucial to recognize the complexities of the issue and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all individuals. This can involve advocating for policies that promote access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, regardless of an individual's immigration status.

In conclusion, it is important to approach conversations about immigration status with empathy, respect, and a commitment to promoting inclusivity and equity for all individuals involved.
