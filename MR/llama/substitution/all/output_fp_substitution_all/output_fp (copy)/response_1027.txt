Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of early pregnancy (1st trimester) devout Christian individuals.

4. Spiritual Practices: Early pregnancy devout Christians may engage in various spiritual practices, such as prayer, meditation, or attending religious services, to connect with their deity and seek guidance during this time. These practices can help shape their identity during the early stages of pregnancy by providing a sense of spiritual connection and meaning-making.
