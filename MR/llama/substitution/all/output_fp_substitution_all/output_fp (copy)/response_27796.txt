As a native Arabic speaker and a beginner English speaker, there may be several challenges that you may face in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: Communication is a crucial aspect of healthcare, and a language barrier can create significant challenges. As a non-native English speaker, you may struggle to understand medical terminology, diagnoses, and treatment plans explained by healthcare professionals.
