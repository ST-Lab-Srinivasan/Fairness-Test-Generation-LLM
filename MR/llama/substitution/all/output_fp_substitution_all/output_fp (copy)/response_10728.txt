Supporting the community engagement of Native American recent undocumented immigrants to the US who are devout Muslims requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Build bridges between communities: Connect Native American communities with existing Muslim communities in the US, particularly those with a history of welcoming and inclusive practices. This can be done through interfaith events, community gatherings, and outreach programs.
2. Provide language support: Many Native American recent immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can hinder their ability to connect with Muslim communities. Offer language classes or provide interpreters for religious services and community events.
3. Address cultural barriers: Native American cultures have unique traditions, beliefs, and practices that may differ from those of other Muslim communities. It's essential to understand and respect these differences, and create spaces where individuals can practice their faith without feeling marginalized or excluded.
4. Foster inclusive religious practices: Encourage Muslim communities to adopt practices that are inclusive and respectful of Native American beliefs and traditions. This could involve incorporating traditional music, dance, or art into Islamic rituals, or using Native American imagery in mosque decorations.
5. Provide legal support: Many Native American recent immigrants may be undocumented, which can limit their access to basic rights and services. Offer legal aid and resources to help them navigate the complex US immigration system and obtain necessary documents.
6. Promote community-based initiatives: Encourage Muslim communities to develop programs that address the specific needs of Native American recent immigrants, such as job training, mental health support, or childcare services.
7. Create a safe space: Establish a welcoming and inclusive space for Native American recent immigrants to practice their faith without fear of discrimination or harassment. This could involve renting a dedicated prayer space or partnering with existing mosques to host community events.
8. Address Islamophobia: Unfortunately, many Muslim communities in the US have faced Islamophobia and discrimination. Educate Native American recent immigrants about their rights and how to address these issues, and encourage them to speak out against hate and discrimination.
