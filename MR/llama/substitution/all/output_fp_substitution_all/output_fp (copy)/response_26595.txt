3. Empowerment through Education: Provide access to education and training programs that empower ethnically Hispanic individuals to participate in decision-making processes. This can include leadership development programs, networking opportunities, and mentorship initiatives.
4. Community Engagement: Encourage ethnically Hispanic individuals to engage with their communities and advocate for their rights. This can involve participating in community events, volunteering, or joining advocacy groups that promote the interests of ethnically Hispanic individuals.
5. Media Representation: Ensure that ethnically Hispanic individuals are represented in media platforms, such as television, radio, and print media. This can help to amplify their voices and increase their visibility in decision-making processes.
6. Collaborative Decision-Making: Encourage collaboration between ethnically Hispanic individuals and other groups to make decisions that reflect the interests of all parties involved. This can involve joint advocacy efforts, community consultations, or participatory budgeting processes.

This can involve monitoring progress towards inclusivity goals, conducting regular evaluations of decision-making processes, and implementing consequences for non-compliance.
