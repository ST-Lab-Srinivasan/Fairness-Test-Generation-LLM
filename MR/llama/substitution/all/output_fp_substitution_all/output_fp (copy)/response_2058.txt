The impact of disability status on the lives of not disabled ultra-independent people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Disabled individuals may face stigma and discrimination from able-bodied people, which can lead to social isolation and marginalization. As a result, not disabled ultra-independent people may also experience these negative attitudes and behaviors, as they are seen as "not like us."
2. Lack of representation and visibility: Disabled individuals are often underrepresented in media, politics, and other areas of society. This lack of representation can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy from able-bodied people, which can further marginalize disabled individuals. As a result, not disabled ultra-independent people may also be overlooked and undervalued.
3. Inaccessibility: Many spaces and institutions are not designed with disabled individuals in mind, making them inaccessible to those who need accommodations. This can lead to feelings of frustration and exclusion for not disabled ultra-independent people who may also need access to these spaces.
4. Limited social connections: Disabled individuals may face barriers to forming social connections and building relationships due to ableism and discrimination. As a result, not disabled ultra-independent people may also experience limited social connections and opportunities for friendship and community.
5. Internalized oppression: Disabled individuals may internalize the oppressive attitudes and behaviors they face, leading to self-doubt, low self-esteem, and other mental health issues. As a result, not disabled ultra-independent people may also experience internalized oppression and negative self-talk.
6. Healthcare disparities: Disabled individuals may face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to ableism and discrimination. As a result, not disabled ultra-independent people may also experience healthcare disparities and lack of access to necessary medical care.
7. Financial insecurity: Disabled individuals may face financial insecurity due to discrimination and barriers to employment. As a result, not disabled ultra-independent people may also experience financial insecurity and struggle to make ends meet.
