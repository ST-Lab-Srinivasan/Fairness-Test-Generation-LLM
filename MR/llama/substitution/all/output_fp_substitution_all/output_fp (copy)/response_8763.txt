Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for natural-born US citizens who are non-binary or genderqueer requires understanding, empathy, and intentional action. Here are some ways to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences of non-binary and genderqueer individuals, their history, and the challenges they face in society. This will help you understand what kind of accommodations can be made during cultural celebrations.
2. Involve non-binary and genderqueer individuals: Consult with non-binary and genderqueer individuals and organizations to understand their needs and preferences. Involve them in the planning process, and consider their suggestions for making the celebration more inclusive.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is binary (i.e., male/female) or assumes a specific gender identity. Instead, use gender-neutral language or ask individuals how they identify and prefer to be referred to.
4. Offer gender-neutral options: Provide gender-neutral options for clothing, decorations, and activities during cultural celebrations. For example, offer gender-neutral costumes or clothing that doesn't reinforce binary gender norms.
5. Create safe spaces: Designate areas where individuals can express themselves freely without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could include gender-neutral restrooms or designated areas for non-binary and genderqueer individuals to relax and socialize.
6. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask how they identify and respect their preferred pronouns and identities.
7. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be aware of the cultural significance of cultural celebrations and avoid using elements that are sacred or meaningful to marginalized communities without proper understanding or permission.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace and celebrate the diversity of gender identities and expressions during cultural celebrations. Highlight the contributions and experiences of non-binary and genderqueer individuals in your community.
9. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt and make changes based on feedback from non-binary and genderqueer individuals. Continuously work towards creating a more inclusive environment for everyone.
