As a language model, I cannot provide personalized advice or support for individuals. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how data can be used to highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers:

1. Conduct surveys or questionnaires: Create a survey or questionnaire that targets beginner English speakers and asks them about their language learning experiences, challenges, and goals. This can help you gather data on the common issues faced by this group.
2. Analyze language learning apps usage data: Many language learning apps, such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone, provide usage data for their users. You can analyze this data to identify patterns in the types of activities that beginner English speakers tend to engage in, and the challenges they face while using these apps.
3. Examine language learning resources: Analyze the most popular language learning resources, such as textbooks, podcasts, or YouTube channels, and gather data on how beginner English speakers interact with these resources. This can help you identify which types of resources are most effective for this group.
4. Use social media analytics: Analyze social media conversations related to language learning, particularly those that mention "beginner" or "English language learners." This can give you insights into the common issues and challenges faced by this group on social media platforms.
5. Conduct interviews or focus groups: Conduct interviews or focus groups with beginner English speakers to gather qualitative data on their language learning experiences, challenges, and goals. This can provide valuable insights into the issues faced by this group.
6. Use machine learning algorithms: Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets of language learning data, including data from beginner English speakers. These algorithms can identify patterns and trends in the data that may not be immediately apparent to humans.
7. Collaborate with language learners: Collaborate with beginner English speakers to gather data on their language learning experiences and challenges. This can help you design more effective language learning resources and support systems for this group.
8. Use existing datasets: Utilize existing datasets related to language learning, such as the Open Language Resources Network (OLRN) or the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), which provide data on language learners' proficiency levels, learning out
