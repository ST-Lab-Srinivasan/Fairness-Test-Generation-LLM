Here are some ways cultural exchange can promote understanding between Beginner English Speaker Mixed African American groups:

1. Cross-cultural sharing: Encourage members of the group to share their cultural practices, traditions, and beliefs with each other.

2. Intercultural dialogue: Organize group discussions or workshops where members can share their experiences, thoughts, and feelings about their cultural identities. This can help create a safe space for open communication and mutual understanding. Encourage participants to ask questions, listen actively, and share their own perspectives without judgment.
3. Joint community service: Plan community service projects or volunteer opportunities that bring members of the group together. Working towards a common goal can foster a sense of unity and cooperation, while also promoting empathy and understanding among participants. For example, the group could participate in a local food drive or clean-up initiative, which would allow them to work together towards a shared objective.
4. Cultural immersion: Organize cultural events or activities that encourage members of the group to learn from each other's traditions and customs. For instance, African American members can teach their peers about traditional African dances, music, and storytelling, while their peers can share their knowledge of mixed-race history and culture.
