As a natural-born Canadian citizen who is also a native Chinese speaker, there may be some unique challenges you face in the healthcare system. Here are some potential issues to consider:

1. Language barriers: Depending on where you live in Canada, you may encounter language barriers as a non-English speaking resident. While many healthcare providers in Canada offer multi-lingual services, there may be limited access to medical interpreters or translators, especially in rural areas.
