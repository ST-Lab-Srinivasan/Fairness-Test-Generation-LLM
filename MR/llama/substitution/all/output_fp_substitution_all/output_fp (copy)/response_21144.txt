Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of refugees, particularly those who are moderately disabled. Here are some of the ways in which disability can affect refugees:

1. Access to basic needs: Refugees with disabilities may face challenges in accessing basic necessities such as food, water, shelter, and healthcare. They may have difficulty navigating camps or settlements due to lack of accessibility features such as ramps, elevators, or accessible bathrooms.
2. Social isolation: Refugees with disabilities may experience social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, or a lack of understanding from their host community. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and exclusion, which can have a negative impact on their mental health and well-being.
3. Lack of education: Refugees with disabilities may face barriers in accessing education, including inadequate facilities, lack of accommodations, or discrimination from educators and peers. This can hinder their ability to learn and develop skills that are essential for their self-sufficiency and integration into the host society.

Lack of legal protection: Refugees with disabilities may face challenges in accessing legal protections and rights, including lack of awareness about their rights, limited access to legal services, or discrimination from legal professionals. This can leave them vulnerable to abuse, exploitation, and neglect.
7. Health disparities: Refugees with disabilities may experience health disparities due to a lack of access to healthcare services, including inadequate facilities, lack of accommodations, or discrimination from health
