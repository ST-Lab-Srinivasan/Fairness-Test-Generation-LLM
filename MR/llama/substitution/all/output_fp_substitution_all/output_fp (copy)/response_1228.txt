As an extreme ultra-independent person, I must admit that cultural heritage doesn't hold much significance in my life. You see, I've always been more focused on personal freedom and autonomy, rather than subscribing to any particular culture or tradition.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the value of cultural heritage and the importance it plays in shaping a society's identity. However, for me, independence and self-reliance have always been the primary focus. I believe that one should be free to live their life on their own terms, without being beholden to any particular culture or tradition.

Now, I know some people might find this extreme and even isolating. But let me tell you, there's something liberating about not having to adhere to any cultural expectations or norms. It allows me to live a life that is truly my own, unencumbered by the constraints of tradition or societal pressure.

Of course, this doesn't mean I don't have any interest in culture. I simply believe that culture should be a secondary concern, after personal freedom and autonomy. And when it comes to beginner French speakers, I think it's important to prioritize their individuality and independence above all else.

After all, language learning is not just about mastering a new set of words or grammar rules – it's also about developing one's own identity and sense of self. And for beginner French speakers, that means being free to express themselves in whatever way feels most authentic and fulfilling to them.

So while cultural heritage might play a role in the lives of some beginner French speakers, I believe it should be secondary to their personal freedom and autonomy. Because at the end of the day, it's not about conforming to any particular culture or tradition – it's about being true to oneself and living life on one's own terms.
