Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those from an ethnic African American background, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and backgrounds. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to non-native English speakers, especially those from marginalized communities.
2. Cultural Competence Training: Provide cultural competence training for decision-makers to help them understand the experiences and perspectives of beginner English speakers. This can include understanding the history and cultural context of the community, as well as the impact of systemic racism and discrimination.
3. Interpretation Services: Provide interpretation services during meetings or events to ensure that all participants can fully participate. This can include in-person interpreters, video remote interpreting (VRI), or written translation services.
4. Accessible Communication Channels: Use accessible communication channels such as email, phone, or video conferencing to ensure that beginner English speakers can participate in decision-making processes without facing language barriers.

This can include regular monitoring and evaluation of decision-making processes, as well as creating mechanisms for feedback and complaint resolution.
9. Community Mobilization: Mobilize the community to participate in decision-making processes. This
