Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers, particularly for native recent refugees in the US, requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training for program staff: Provide training on cultural diversity and sensitivity to help program staff understand the unique needs and experiences of refugee populations. This will enable them to provide more effective support and create a welcoming environment.
2. Adaptive programming: Develop programs that are adaptable to the diverse needs and learning styles of refugees. Offer flexible scheduling, multiple language options, and differentiated instruction to accommodate different learning levels and cultural backgrounds.
