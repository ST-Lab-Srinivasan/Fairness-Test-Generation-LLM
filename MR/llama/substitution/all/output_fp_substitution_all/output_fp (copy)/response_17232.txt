Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Lifelong Beginner French Speakers After Widowhood

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have recently experienced a significant life change such as widowhood. This study aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of lifelong beginner French speakers after losing their spouses. The research will explore the ways in which cultural heritage affects these individuals' sense of self, values, beliefs, and behaviors, and how it informs their experiences of language learning and cultural assimilation.

Research Questions:

1. How do lifelong beginner French speakers after widowhood perceive and interact with their cultural heritage?
2. What role does cultural heritage play in shaping the identities of these individuals?
3. How does cultural heritage influence the language learning process for these individuals?
4. What are the challenges faced by lifelong beginner French speakers after widowhood in terms of cultural assimilation and how do they navigate these challenges?

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage plays a crucial role in shaping individuals' identities, particularly during times of transition or change (Hall, 1984; Giddens, 1991). Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging and identity, which can be challenged when individuals experience significant life changes such as widowhood. Studies have shown that individuals who experience loss often struggle to find meaning and purpose in their lives (Komarov, 2014), and may turn to language learning as a way to cope with their grief and find a sense of connection to their cultural heritage (Wodniecka, 2015).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, employing semi-structured interviews with lifelong beginner French speakers who have experienced widowhood. Participants will be recruited through local community centers and online language learning groups. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis will be conducted to identify patterns and trends in the data.
