Promoting the educational success of ethnically full African American traditionalist students requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally Relevant Curriculum: Develop a curriculum that reflects the experiences, culture, and history of African Americans. This can include incorporating African American authors, artists, and historical figures into the curriculum, as well as exploring themes such as identity, race, and social justice.
2. Inclusive Classroom Environment: Create a classroom environment that is inclusive and respectful of all students' backgrounds. This can involve implementing culturally responsive teaching practices, providing opportunities for students to share their experiences and perspectives, and creating a safe space for dialogue and reflection.
3. Mentorship and Support: Provide mentorship and support to traditionalist students through programs such as peer mentoring, academic support groups, and extracurricular activities that promote cultural identity and pride.
4. Family Engagement: Involve parents and guardians in their child's education by providing opportunities for them to participate in school events, join parent-teacher organizations, and receive regular updates on their child's academic progress.
5. Community Partnerships: Develop partnerships with community organizations that support the educational success of African American students. This can involve collaborating on programs such as tutoring, mentorship, and cultural enrichment activities.
6. Addressing Implicit Bias: Train teachers and staff on how to recognize and address implicit bias in the classroom, which can help create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for traditionalist students.
7. Teacher Professional Development: Provide professional development opportunities for teachers on culturally responsive teaching practices, restorative justice, and trauma-informed teaching to better serve the needs of ethnically full African American students.
8. Academic and Social Support: Offer academic support services such as tutoring, academic advising, and college preparatory programs to help traditionalist students succeed academically and socially.
9. Encouraging Positive Identity Development: Foster a positive identity development among traditionalist students by promoting cultural pride, self-esteem, and self-worth. This
