Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of beginner Arabic speakers who may hold non-liberal views:

1. Provide access to language learning resources: Offering beginner Arabic language classes or resources can help individuals learn the language and connect with the culture, regardless of their political beliefs. This can help promote cross-cultural understanding and respect.
2. Foster a supportive learning environment: Create a welcoming and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable expressing themselves. Encourage open communication and active listening to foster mutual understanding and respect.
3. Promote cultural exchange programs: Organize cultural exchange programs or events that bring together individuals from different backgrounds, including those with non-liberal views. These programs can help promote cross-cultural understanding, empathy, and respect.
4. Encourage critical thinking and media literacy: Teach students to think critically about the information they consume, and how to evaluate sources for reliability and bias. This can help them make informed decisions and form their own opinions based on evidence.
5. Foster interfaith dialogue and understanding: Encourage interfaith dialogue and discussion among students from different religious backgrounds. This can help promote mutual respect, understanding, and coexistence.
6. Support marginalized communities: Offer resources and support to marginalized communities, including refugees, immigrants, and minority groups. This can help promote social inclusion and address systemic inequalities.
7. Advocate for policies that promote inclusivity: Work with policymakers to create policies that promote inclusivity and social cohesion, such as language education programs, cultural festivals, and community outreach initiatives.
8. Encourage diverse representation in media: Promote diverse representation in media, including Arabic-language media, to provide role models and positive representations of marginalized communities.
9. Foster mentorship and networking opportunities: Pair beginner Arabic speakers with more advanced learners or native speakers who can provide guidance and support throughout
