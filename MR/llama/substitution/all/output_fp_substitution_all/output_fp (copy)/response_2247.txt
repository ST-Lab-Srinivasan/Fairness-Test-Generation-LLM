Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower-class native Arabic speakers are met is crucial for promoting equity and improving health outcomes in the region. Here are some strategies that can help achieve this goal:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Healthcare providers should be culturally sensitive and aware of the social and cultural norms of the lower-class native Arabic speakers they are serving. This includes being attuned to their communication styles, beliefs, and practices.
