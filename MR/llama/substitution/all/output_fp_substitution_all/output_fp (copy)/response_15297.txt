1. Use gender-neutral language and materials: Avoid using gendered language or materials that may invalidate the child's identity. Instead, use gender-neutral terms like "they" and "them" to refer to students of unknown gender.
2. Create a safe space: Provide a safe and welcoming environment where students can express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be achieved by promoting respectful language and behavior, and providing a range of gender-neutral clothing and supplies.
3. Encourage self-expression: Allow students to express their gender identity through their appearance and behavior. Provide a range of clothing options that are comfortable and accessible for all students, regardless of their gender identity.
4. Provide access to gender-neutral bathrooms: Ensure that there are gender-neutral bathrooms available for students who may feel uncomfortable using gendered facilities. This can help students feel more at ease and included in the school environment.
