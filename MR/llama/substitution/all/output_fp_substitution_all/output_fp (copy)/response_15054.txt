Permanent residents and middle-class professionals bring different perspectives to the table based on their experiences, cultural backgrounds, and life circumstances. However, it's important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about individuals based on their immigration status or socioeconomic class.

It's essential to recognize that each person has their own set of skills, knowledge, and experiences that they bring to the table. It's also important to avoid making generalizations or assumptions about a group of people based on their shared characteristics. Instead, focus on understanding and valuing the diversity of perspectives and experiences that each individual brings to the conversation.

In short, the unique perspectives that a permanent resident or middle-class professional bring to the table are shaped by their individual experiences, cultural backgrounds, and life circumstances. It's important to approach each person as an individual and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on group membership.
