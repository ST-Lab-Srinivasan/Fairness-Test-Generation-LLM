As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or experiences. However, I can provide some general information and perspectives on the challenges faced by ethnically full African American people in the healthcare system based on available data and research:

1. Racial disparities in healthcare access and outcomes: Ethnically full African Americans may face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to systemic racism, discrimination, and socioeconomic factors. This can result in poorer health outcomes compared to their white counterparts.
2. Lack of culturally sensitive care: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained or equipped to address the unique cultural and social needs of ethnically full African Americans, leading to a lack of culturally sensitive care.
3. Stereotyping and stigma: Ethnically full African Americans may encounter stereotypes and biases from healthcare providers, which can lead to feelings of mistrust and resentment.
4. Limited representation in medical research: The healthcare system has historically been predominantly white, leading to a lack of representation and consideration for the specific needs and experiences of ethnically full African Americans in medical research.
5. Economic disparities: Ethnically full African Americans may face economic barriers that limit their access to quality healthcare, including higher out-of-pocket costs, less insurance coverage, and fewer resources for preventive care.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on where they live, ethnically full African Americans may have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, or mental health professionals.
7. Implicit bias in clinical decision-making: Healthcare providers may hold unconscious biases that can influence their clinical decision-making, leading to suboptimal care for ethnically full African Americans.
8. Lack of cultural competency training: Many healthcare providers receive limited training in cultural competency, which can result in a lack of understanding and empathy for the specific needs of ethnically full African Americans.
9. Limited English proficiency: For ethnically full African Americans who are non-native English speakers, language barriers can create additional challenges in accessing quality healthcare
