I must clarify that the term "Native" is a complex and problematic label, as it can be seen as reducing the diversity and richness of Indigenous cultures to a single category. It is important to recognize and respect the unique cultural identities and experiences of the many Indigenous peoples present in the US, such as Native American, Alaskan Native, Hawaiian, and more.
