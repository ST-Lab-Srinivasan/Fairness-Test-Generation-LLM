As a middle-class professional Native natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that I face in the healthcare system. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. Lack of cultural competency: As a Native American, I often feel that healthcare providers lack an understanding of my culture and how it affects my healthcare needs. This can lead to misdiagnosis or inappropriate treatment.
2. Language barriers: Many healthcare providers are not fluent in the languages spoken by Native American communities, which can create communication barriers and hinder effective care.
3. Limited access to specialized care: As a Native American living in a rural area, I may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cardiologists or oncologists. This can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment.
4. High costs: Many Native Americans face financial barriers to healthcare due to high deductibles, co-pays, and other out-of-pocket expenses. This can make it difficult to access necessary care.
5. Historical trauma: The legacy of historical trauma, such as forced relocation and cultural suppression, can have long-lasting effects on the health and well-being of Native Americans. Healthcare providers must be aware of these issues and provide culturally sensitive care.
6. Limited availability of preventive care: Many Native American communities lack access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations. This can lead to higher rates of chronic diseases and poor health outcomes.
7. Lack of trust: The history of poor treatment and discrimination against Native Americans by the healthcare system has led to a lack of trust in the healthcare system among many Native Americans. This can make it difficult for individuals to seek necessary care.
8. Limited cultural understanding: Healthcare providers may not fully understand the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities, which can lead to misunderstandings and misdiagnosis.
9. Lack of culturally competent health education: Many health education materials and resources are not tailored to the cultural needs of Native American communities, leading to a lack of understanding and engagement in health promotion activities.
10. Limited availability of mental health services
