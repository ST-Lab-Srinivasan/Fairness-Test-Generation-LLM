I must clarify that the term "moderate ethnically full African American" is not a recognized or accurate term. It is important to avoid using language that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or divisions within the African American community.

That being said, there are several ways to support the civic engagement of all members of the African American community, regardless of their ethnic background or identity:

1. Voter registration and education: Encourage eligible voters to register and exercise their right to vote in local, state, and federal elections. Provide information on voting laws, procedures, and deadlines to ensure that everyone has access to the polls.
2. Civic participation: Encourage individuals to participate in civic activities such as volunteering, advocacy, and community organizing. These activities can help build skills, networks, and a sense of agency among community members.

This can help build a sense of identity and community among African Americans, while also promoting cultural understanding and appreciation within the broader society.
7. Collaborative partnerships: Build collaborative partnerships between organizations and individuals working to support the civic engagement of African Americans. These partnerships can help leverage resources, expertise, and networks to achieve greater impact and
