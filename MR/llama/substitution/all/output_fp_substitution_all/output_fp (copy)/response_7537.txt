Addressing the needs of non-high-income beginner Chinese speaker individuals in disaster response requires a tailored approach that considers their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that information and resources are accessible to non-high-income beginner Chinese speakers by providing materials in simplified Chinese characters, using clear and concise language, and making information available through multiple channels (e.g., social media, SMS, radio broadcasts).

4. Community outreach: Engage with local communities and organizations that cater to non-high-income beginner Chinese speakers to ensure that they are aware of the resources available to them.
5. Inclusive messaging: Use inclusive language in communication materials to avoid unintendedly excluding or marginalizing certain groups, such as using images or messages that reflect the diversity of the affected population.
6. Training and education: Provide training and education to relief workers on how to effectively communicate with non-high-income beginner Chinese speakers and address their unique needs.
7. Partnership with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that cater to non-high-income beginner Chinese speakers to leverage their existing networks and resources, and ensure that the response is culturally appropriate and sensitive.
