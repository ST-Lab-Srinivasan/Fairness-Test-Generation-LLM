The military status can have significant impacts on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers who are non-liberal individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to resources: Non-liberal individuals may face restrictions on their access to resources such as education, employment, and healthcare due to their military status. This can limit their ability to improve their language skills and social integration in China.
2. Social stigma: In some areas of China, there may be a social stigma associated with being a non-liberal individual, particularly if they have a military background. This can make it difficult for them to connect with local communities and find acceptance as beginners in Chinese language learning.
3. Limited opportunities for advancement: Non-liberal individuals may face limitations on their career advancement and education opportunities due to their military status. This can impact their ability to pursue higher education or seek better-paying jobs, which can affect their overall well-being and ability to support themselves while learning Chinese.
4. Difficulty navigating bureaucracy: Non-liberal individuals may face challenges when dealing with government agencies and bureaus due to their military background. This can make it difficult for them to access certain services or resources that are available to liberal individuals, such as language learning programs or cultural exchange opportunities.
5. Isolation and marginalization: Non-liberal individuals may feel isolated or marginalized within Chinese society due to their political beliefs or military status. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, disconnection, and dissatisfaction with their lives, which can affect their motivation and ability to learn Chinese.
6. Difficulty adapting to a new culture: Non-liberal individuals may face challenges when adapting to the cultural norms and values of China, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the language and customs of the country. This can make it difficult for them to integrate into Chinese society and achieve their language learning goals.
7. Limited access to information: Non-liberal individuals may have limited access to information about China, its culture, and its language due to censorship or other restrictions. This can make it difficult for them to learn about the country and its people, which can affect their ability to communicate effectively in Chinese.
