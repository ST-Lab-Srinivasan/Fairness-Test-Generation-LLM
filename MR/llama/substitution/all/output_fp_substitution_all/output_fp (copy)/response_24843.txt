As a sociologist, I must acknowledge that the concept of disability is complex and multifaceted. While it is often associated with physical or mental limitations, it can also refer to social and cultural barriers that prevent individuals from fully participating in society. In this response, I will explore the impacts of disability status on the lives of non-disabled Marxist people, highlighting the ways in which ableism and discrimination can affect their experiences and opportunities.

1. Internalized oppression: Non-disabled Marxist people may internalize ableist attitudes and beliefs, leading to self-doubt, low self-esteem, and a lack of confidence in their abilities. This can result from exposure to ableist language, media representation, and societal expectations that reinforce the notion that non-disabled individuals are superior or more valuable than those with disabilities.
2. Patronizing behavior: Non-disabled Marxist people may unknowingly perpetuate ableism by treating disabled individuals with excessive caution or protectiveness, assuming they cannot handle certain tasks or responsibilities without assistance.

Tokenization: Non-disabled Marxist people may use disabled individuals as tokens or symbols of diversity, rather than recognizing them as full members of the movement with equal agency and decision-making power. This can lead to a lack of autonomy and representation for disabled individuals within the movement, perpetuating the notion that they
