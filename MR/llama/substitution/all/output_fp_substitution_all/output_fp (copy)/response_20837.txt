Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers, including recent refugees to the US, requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for staff and volunteers on cultural competency and how to work with diverse populations, including refugees. This can include understanding the experiences and challenges faced by recent refugees and how to create an inclusive environment.
2. Language Support: Offer language classes or interpretation services during cultural programs to ensure that all participants can fully engage. This can include beginner Spanish classes for those who are learning the language, as well as interpretation services for those who may not speak Spanish fluently.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that the cultural program is accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. This can involve providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
4. Cultural Representation: Incorporate diverse cultures and perspectives into the cultural program, including the cultures of recent refugees. This can involve inviting guest speakers from different backgrounds to share their experiences and traditions, or incorporating music, dance, and art from various cultures into the program.
5. Collaboration with Refugee Organizations: Partner with organizations that work specifically with recent refugees to help promote the cultural program and reach a wider audience. This can involve collaborating on marketing materials, hosting events together, or providing transportation for participants.
6. Inclusive Programming: Design the cultural program to be inclusive of all participants, regardless of their background. This can involve incorporating interactive activities that encourage participation and foster a sense of community, such as group discussions, art-making, or cooking classes.
7. Flexibility: Be flexible in terms of scheduling and location to accommodate the needs of recent refugees. Many may have conflicting responsibilities or transportation challenges, so it's important to be understanding and accommodating.
8. Marketing and Outreach: Use multiple channels to promote the cultural program, including social media, flyers, and word-of-mouth. Reach out to local refugee organizations and community centers to help spread the word and encourage participation.
9. Evaluation and Feedback
