People in the first trimester of pregnancy, who are not deep in poverty, may face a range of legal challenges. Here are some of the common ones:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: Even though many states have laws that require insurance coverage for prenatal care, many low-income individuals may not have access to affordable health insurance. This can result in delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy and birth.
2. Discrimination: Pregnant individuals, especially those who are minorities or belong to marginalized communities, may face discrimination in various areas of life, including employment, housing, and healthcare. This can result in a lack of access to resources and support during pregnancy.
3. Lack of informed consent: Many pregnant individuals may not have access to adequate information about their pregnancy, including their options for prenatal care, childbirth, and postpartum care. This can result in a lack of autonomy and agency in making decisions about their healthcare.
4. Limited access to maternal health services: Even though many states have laws that require insurance coverage for maternal health services, many low-income individuals may not have access to these services due to financial constraints or limited availability. This can result in a lack of access to essential care during pregnancy and childbirth.
5. Social isolation: Pregnant individuals who are experiencing poverty may face social isolation, which can exacerbate the mental and emotional challenges of pregnancy. This can result in feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and depression.
6. Limited access to nutrition and healthy living conditions: Pregnant individuals who are experiencing poverty may have limited access to healthy food options and safe living conditions. This can result in a higher risk of complications during pregnancy and birth.
7. Lack of transportation: Many low-income individuals may not have access to reliable transportation, which can make it difficult to get to prenatal appointments or other essential healthcare services.
8. Limited access to support systems: Pregnant individuals who are experiencing poverty may have limited access to support
