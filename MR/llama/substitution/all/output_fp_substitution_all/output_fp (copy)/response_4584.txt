Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development and integration of refugees in the United States, especially for those who have recently arrived as older adults (ages 65 and above). Here are some ways mentorship can help:

1. Cultural orientation: Refugees often face challenges related to cultural differences and navigating a new society. A mentor can provide guidance on cultural norms, customs, and practices in the US, helping them to better understand and navigate their new environment.
