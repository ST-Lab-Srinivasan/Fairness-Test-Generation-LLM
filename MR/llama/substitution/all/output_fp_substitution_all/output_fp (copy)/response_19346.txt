Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Chinese speakers who are not deep in poverty requires careful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer free or low-cost events: Many beginners may not be able to afford expensive language classes or events. By offering free or low-cost events, you can make them more accessible to a wider range of people.
2. Provide childcare and transportation options: Many parents may not be able to attend events without childcare or transportation. Consider providing these services to make the events more inclusive.
3. Use multiple languages: Use both Chinese and English (or other local languages) during events to cater to a wider range of participants. This can help beginners who are not fluent in Chinese but want to learn.
4. Foster a supportive community: Encourage participants to practice speaking Chinese with each other, and create a supportive environment where everyone feels comfortable learning.
5. Use interactive and engaging activities: Incorporate games, quizzes, and other interactive activities into events to keep participants engaged and motivated.
6. Offer different levels of classes: Cater to beginners by offering classes that are tailored to their level of proficiency. This can help them feel more comfortable and confident in their learning journey.
7. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local organizations, such as community centers or libraries, to reach a wider audience and make events more accessible.
8. Provide resources and support: Offer participants access to additional resources, such as language learning apps or books, to help them continue their learning journey outside of events.
9. Create a welcoming environment: Ensure that the event space is comfortable and inviting for all participants. This can involve providing refreshments, comfortable seating, and adequate lighting.
10. Evaluate and improve: Regularly evaluate the inclusivity of your events and make improvements based on feedback from participants. This can help ensure that your events are as inclusive and accessible as possible.

By following these suggestions, you can create more inclusive community events for beginner Chinese speakers who are not deep in poverty. Remember to be patient, understanding, and respectful of participants' diverse backgrounds and needs.
