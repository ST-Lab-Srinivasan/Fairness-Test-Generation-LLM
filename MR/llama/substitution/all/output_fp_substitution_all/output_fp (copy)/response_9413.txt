Promoting the accessibility of public services for devout Muslims with no known genetic conditions requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various barriers to access. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Inclusive Design: Design public services with inclusivity in mind, taking into account the needs of individuals with disabilities, including those related to Islamic practices. For example, provide separate prayer rooms for men and women, or ensure that the building layout allows for easy navigation using a wheelchair.
2. Accessible Communication: Provide accessible communication channels, such as braille signage, audio announcements, or sign language interpreters, to ensure that everyone can access information.
3. Accommodating Schedules: Be flexible with scheduling, allowing individuals to attend services during times that are convenient for them, including outside of traditional working hours.
4. Transportation Options: Provide transportation options that cater to the needs of devout Muslims, such as wheelchair-accessible vehicles or transportation services that allow for easy navigation during prayer times.
5. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for public service staff to ensure that they are aware of and respectful of Islamic practices and customs.
6. Shariah-Compliant Financing Options: Offer financing options that are compliant with Islamic principles, such as interest-free loans or financing structures that do not involve usury.
7. Halal Certification: Ensure that public services are halal-certified, meaning that they meet the dietary requirements of Muslims.
8. Educational Resources: Provide educational resources on Islamic practices and customs to help individuals understand the needs of devout Muslims and how to accommodate them.
9. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement efforts to raise awareness about the accessibility of public services for devout Muslims and to build partnerships with local Islamic organizations.
10. Continuous Improvement: Regularly evaluate and improve the accessibility of public services based on feedback from individuals with disabilities and the broader community.

By implementing these strategies, public services can become more inclusive and accessible for devout Muslims with no known genetic conditions
