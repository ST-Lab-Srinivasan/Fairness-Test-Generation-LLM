As a beginner Arabic speaker, individuals who are just above the poverty line may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in an Arabic-speaking country. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Language Barrier: The primary challenge faced by beginner Arabic speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and procedures can be complex, and understanding them can be difficult for those who are not fluent in Arabic. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and missed opportunities to access legal resources.
2. Lack of Access to Legal Resources: Many beginner Arabic speakers may not have access to legal resources such as books, websites, or legal aid organizations that provide information and support in their native language. This can limit their ability to learn about their rights and responsibilities under the law.
3. Limited Knowledge of Legal Procedures: The legal system in Arabic-speaking countries can be unfamiliar to beginner Arabic speakers, making it difficult for them to navigate procedures such as filing a lawsuit, appealing a decision, or accessing legal aid.
4. Cultural Barriers: The legal system in Arabic-speaking countries may have cultural nuances that are unfamiliar to beginner Arabic speakers. For example, the concept of "honor" may play a significant role in legal proceedings, which can be challenging for those who are not familiar with these cultural norms.
5. Discrimination: Beginner Arabic speakers may face discrimination in the legal system due to their language proficiency or cultural background. This can lead to unequal access to legal resources and opportunities.
6. Lack of Trust: beginner Arabic speakers may lack trust in the legal system, which can make it difficult for them to seek legal assistance or navigate legal procedures.
7. Limited Access to Legal Education: Many beginner Arabic speakers may not have access to legal education or training, which can limit their understanding of legal concepts and procedures.
8. Difficulty in Finding Pro Bono Legal Services: Many beginner Arabic speakers may struggle to find pro bono legal services, which can be expensive and inaccessible for those who are not fluent in Arabic.
9. Limited Access to Legal Aid Organ
