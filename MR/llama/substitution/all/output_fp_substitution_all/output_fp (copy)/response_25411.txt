As a native English speaker and natural-born US citizen, I can attest to the challenges faced by many individuals in the US healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues that native English speakers may encounter:

1. Language barriers: For those who are not fluent in Spanish or other languages commonly spoken in their area, communication with healthcare providers can be difficult. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about medical conditions, treatments, and prescriptions.
