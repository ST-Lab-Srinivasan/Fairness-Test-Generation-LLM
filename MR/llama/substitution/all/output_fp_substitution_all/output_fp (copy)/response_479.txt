To ensure that the healthcare needs of high-income recent temporary visa holders to the US are met, several steps can be taken:

1. Access to Health Insurance: Many high-income temporary visa holders may have access to health insurance through their employer or personal means. However, some may not have adequate coverage, especially if they are in the US on a temporary work visa. The US government could consider expanding access to affordable health insurance options for this group, potentially through a public option or by facilitating the purchase of private insurance plans.
2. Public Health Services: High-income temporary visa holders may have access to public health services, such as community clinics or hospital emergency departments, even if they do not have health insurance. The US government could consider investing in these services and making them more accessible to this group.
3. Telemedicine: Temporary visa holders may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to their immigration status or lack of health insurance.

The US government could consider investing in telemedicine infrastructure and promoting its use among temporary visa holders.

Health Promotion and Disease Prevention: High-income temporary visa holders may have greater access to health promotion and disease prevention resources, such as gym memberships or wellness programs. The US government could consider investing in these types of programs specifically for this group, with a focus on preventive care and early intervention.
