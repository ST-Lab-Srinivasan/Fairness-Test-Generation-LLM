Ensuring that the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those who are undocumented and natural-born US citizens, are heard in decision-making processes can be a challenging task. However, there are several strategies that can help amplify their voices and create more inclusive decision-making processes:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide language accessibility tools such as interpreters, translators, or bilingual staff to facilitate communication between undocumented French speakers and decision-makers. This can help bridge the language barrier and ensure that their voices are heard.
2. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement efforts to reach out to undocumented French speakers and build trust. This can involve establishing partnerships with local organizations, hosting town hall meetings, or creating online platforms for feedback and participation.
3. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers to better understand the experiences and perspectives of undocumented French speakers. This can help build empathy and create a more inclusive environment for decision-making.
4. Inclusive Decision-Making Processes: Create inclusive decision-making processes that actively involve undocumented French speakers in the planning and implementation stages. This can involve establishing advisory committees or task forces that represent diverse perspectives, including those of beginner French speakers.
5. Advocacy and Support: Advocate for policies and programs that support the rights and well-being of undocumented French speakers, such as access to healthcare, education, and legal services. This can involve working with advocacy groups or providing direct support to individuals and families.
6. Community Mobilization: Mobilize the broader community to support the voices of beginner French speakers. This can involve organizing events, campaigns, or petitions that raise awareness about their issues and concerns.
7. Technology-based Solutions: Leverage technology-based solutions such as online platforms, apps, or social media to facilitate communication and engagement between undocumented French speakers and decision-makers. This can help increase accessibility and reach a wider audience.
8. Partnerships with Local Organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve the French-speaking immigrant
