The legal system in Mexico is largely based on civil law, which means that the majority of laws are codified and follow a rigid framework. However, there are some challenges faced by Muslims in Mexico when it comes to practicing their religion within the legal framework. Here are some of the key challenges:

1. Lack of recognition: Islam is not an officially recognized religion in Mexico, which means that Muslims do not have the same rights and protections as followers of other religions. This can make it difficult for them to practice their faith freely and without fear of discrimination or persecution.
2. Limited access to religious facilities: While there are some mosques and Islamic centers in Mexico, they are relatively few and far between compared to the number of Muslims living in the country. This can make it difficult for Muslims to find a place to pray and practice their religion.
3. Lack of halal food options: In Mexico, there is a limited availability of halal food options, which can make it difficult for Muslims to observe their dietary restrictions. This can also lead to health problems for those who are not able to access halal food.
4. Discrimination and racism: Unfortunately, discrimination and racism against Muslims is still prevalent in Mexico, despite the country's progressive laws and policies. This can make it difficult for Muslims to feel accepted and included in Mexican society.
5. Lack of knowledge about Islam: Many Mexicans may not be familiar with the teachings and practices of Islam, which can lead to misunderstandings and stereotypes about the religion. This lack of understanding can also make it difficult for Muslims to defend their rights and freedoms within the legal system.
6. Limited access to legal resources: Muslims in Mexico may face barriers when seeking legal advice or representation, as there are limited resources available for them compared to other religious groups. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
7. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The Mexican legal system may not be culturally sensitive to the needs and practices of Muslims, which can lead to misunderstandings and violations of their rights. For example, the legal system may not be aware of the importance of Islamic law regarding inheritance or other aspects of family law
