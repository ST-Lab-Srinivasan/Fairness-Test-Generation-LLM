As a person without any known genetic conditions, I have experienced several challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues that I have encountered:

1. Lack of understanding and empathy from healthcare providers: Many healthcare providers may not be familiar with agnosticism or may hold preconceived notions about people without known genetic conditions. This can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy, making it difficult for me to communicate my needs and concerns.
