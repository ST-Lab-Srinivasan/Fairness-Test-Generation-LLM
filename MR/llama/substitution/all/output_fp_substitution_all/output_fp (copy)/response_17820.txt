3. Naveed Ahmed: A Pakistani-Canadian entrepreneur and community leader, Ahmed has worked to promote diversity and inclusion in Canada. He is the founder of the Pakistan Canadian Professionals Association and has been recognized for his contributions to the community.
4. Fatima Syed: A Somali-Canadian lawyer and activist, Syed has worked to advance the rights of marginalized communities in Canada, including those related to race, gender, and religion. She is a co-founder of the Muslims for Social Justice group and has received numerous awards for her work.
