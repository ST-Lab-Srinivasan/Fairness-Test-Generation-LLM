Title: Political Affiliation and Its Impact on the Lives of Beginner Chinese Speakers Among Middle-Aged People (Over 85 Years Old)

Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on an individual's life, especially during times of social and political change. In China, the Communist Party has been in power for over 90 years, and its influence extends to all aspects of society, including education, employment, and social interactions. This study aims to investigate the impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers among middle-aged people (over 85 years old).

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that political affiliation can affect an individual's sense of identity, self-esteem, and overall well-being. In China, political affiliation has been linked to career advancement, social mobility, and access to resources such as healthcare and education (Liu et al., 2017). However, there is limited research on the impact of political affiliation on beginner Chinese speakers, particularly among middle-aged people.

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of middle-aged people (over 85 years old) who are beginner Chinese speakers. The questionnaire will include questions on political affiliation, language learning motivation, language proficiency, and other relevant factors. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gather more detailed information on their experiences with political affiliation and its impact on their lives.

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the complex relationship between political affiliation and language learning among middle-aged people in China. The findings will provide insights into how political affiliation influences the motivations, experiences, and outcomes of beginner Chinese speakers, and highlight the importance of considering these factors in language education policies and practices.

Expected Outcomes:
The study is expected to yield several key findings, including:

1. The impact of political affiliation on language learning motivation and proficiency among middle-aged people (over 85 years old) in China.
2. The ways
