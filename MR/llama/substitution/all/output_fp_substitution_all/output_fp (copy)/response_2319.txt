Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting exclusively strong transgender long-term and recently temporary visa holder communities. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can contribute to this cause:

1. Visibility and representation: Volunteers can help raise awareness about the issues faced by transgender individuals, particularly those holding temporary or long-term visas.
