There are several ways to support the economic empowerment of non-wealthy, recently arrived immigrants and refugees in the US:

1. Access to affordable financial services: Many immigrants and refugees face barriers to accessing traditional banking services due to lack of credit history or documentation. Microfinance institutions, mobile money platforms, and other innovative financial solutions can help bridge this gap.
2. Job training and placement programs: Providing job training and placement services specifically tailored to the needs of immigrants and refugees can help them acquire in-demand skills and find employment more easily.
3. Entrepreneurship support: Many immigrants and refugees are entrepreneurs themselves, or have the potential to start their own businesses. Supporting them through mentorship, networking opportunities, and access to capital can help them build successful ventures.
4. Access to affordable housing: Secure and affordable housing is a critical factor in allowing immigrants and refugees to establish stability and independence in the US. Investing in affordable housing initiatives can help address this need.
5. Healthcare support: Ensuring access to quality, affordable healthcare is essential for immigrants and refugees to lead healthy and productive lives. Supporting community clinics or advocating for policies that expand access to healthcare can help achieve this goal.
