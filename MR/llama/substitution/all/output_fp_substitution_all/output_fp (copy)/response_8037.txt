As a beginner Spanish speaker in your late 30s, there may be several challenges you face when interacting with the healthcare system in a Spanish-speaking country. Here are some potential challenges to consider:

1. Language Barrier: The most significant challenge is the language barrier. As a non-native speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively with medical professionals, particularly if they are not fluent in English. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications, which can have serious consequences for your health.

As a beginner Spanish speaker, you may find that some medical practices are unfamiliar or even counterintuitive.
