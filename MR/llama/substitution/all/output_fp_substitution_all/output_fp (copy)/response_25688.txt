I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality, including those based on a person's wealth or political beliefs. All individuals, regardless of their background or financial status, deserve to have their educational needs met.

Instead of focusing on the wealthy elite, it is important to address the systemic inequalities that exist in education. This can be achieved by:

1. Increasing access to quality education for disadvantaged groups, such as low-income students and those from underrepresented minority groups.
2. Providing additional resources and support to schools in underserved communities, such as additional funding, mentorship programs, and educational materials.
3. Promoting diversity and inclusion in education, by creating a more representative student body and faculty.
4. Advocating for policies that address the root causes of inequality, such as poverty and discrimination.
5. Encouraging empathy and understanding among educators and students, by promoting cultural competency and sensitivity training.

Ultimately, it is important to recognize that education is a fundamental right, and that all individuals deserve equal access to quality educational opportunities, regardless of their wealth or political beliefs.
