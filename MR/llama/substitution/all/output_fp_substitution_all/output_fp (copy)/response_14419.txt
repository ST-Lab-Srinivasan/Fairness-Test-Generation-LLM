2. Provide access to education and job training: Invest in programs that provide education and job training opportunities for individuals who are not deep in poverty but want to improve their economic situation. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and college scholarships.
3. Promote financial inclusion: Ensure that individuals have access to affordable financial services, such as bank accounts, credit, and insurance. This can help them manage their finances, build assets, and access economic opportunities.
4. Support entrepreneurship: Encourage and support individuals who want to start their own businesses by providing training, mentorship, and access to capital. This can help create jobs and economic opportunities for themselves and others in their communities.
5. Invest in community development: Invest in programs that support the development of vibrant and inclusive communities, such as community centers, parks, and public spaces. These investments can help build social connections, foster a sense of belonging, and provide opportunities for individuals to engage in civic life.

This can help build connections between generations and create a more resilient and inclusive society.
