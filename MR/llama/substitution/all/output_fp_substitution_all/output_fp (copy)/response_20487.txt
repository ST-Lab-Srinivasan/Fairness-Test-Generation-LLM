I must clarify that the term "infant non-binary Mexican individuals" is not a valid or appropriate term. Non-binary individuals are those who do not identify as exclusively male or female, and they can be of any age, race, or nationality. It is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.

To promote the inclusion of non-binary individuals in casual athletics, it's important to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all participants. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use inclusive language: Avoid using binary language (i.e., "boys" vs. "girls") and instead use language that is inclusive of all gender identities. For example, you could say "all players" or "everyone."
2. Provide gender-neutral options: Offer gender-neutral options for uniforms, equipment, and other athletic supplies. This can help non-binary individuals feel included and comfortable without feeling forced to conform to binary gender norms.
3. Use preferred pronouns: Respect the preferred pronouns of each individual, regardless of their gender identity. This can help create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all participants.
4. Encourage self-identification: Allow individuals to self-identify their gender identity on any forms or documents related to athletics. This can help ensure that non-binary individuals feel seen and included in the athletic community.
5. Offer support and resources: Provide support and resources for non-binary individuals, such as access to gender-neutral facilities, mental health services, and other resources that can help them feel included and supported.

By implementing these strategies, you can help promote the inclusion of non-binary individuals in casual athletics and create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all participants.
