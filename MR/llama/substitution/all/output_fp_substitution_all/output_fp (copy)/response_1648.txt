The impact of immigration status on the lives of undocumented or "illegal" immigrants can be significant and far-reaching. Some of the common challenges faced by undocumented immigrants include:

1. Fear of deportation: The constant fear of being deported and separated from their families can cause significant psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
2. Limited access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants often have limited access to medical care, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, exacerbating the condition and causing unnecessary suffering.
3. Barriers to education: Children of undocumented immigrants may face difficulties enrolling in schools or universities due to their immigration status, leading to a lower quality of education and limited opportunities for social mobility.
4. Economic insecurity: Undocumented immigrants often face exploitation in the workplace, as they may be afraid to report abuse or file complaints due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities. They may also experience economic insecurity due to their lack of access to social services and limited job opportunities.
5. Social isolation: Undocumented immigrants may feel isolated from their communities, as they may be afraid to participate in social events or seek help from local organizations due to their immigration status.
6. Lack of legal protections: Undocumented immigrants are often denied access to legal protections, such as workers' rights and consumer protection, which can leave them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.
7. Separation from family: Undocumented immigrants may be separated from their families due to deportation or the inability to sponsor family members for immigration status, leading to emotional distress and disruption of family life.
8. Limited access to social services: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to social services, such as healthcare, education, and housing, which can exacerbate existing challenges and create new ones.
9. Stigma and discrimination: Undocumented immigrants often face stigma and discrimination from the general public, which can lead to feelings of shame, humiliation, and low self-esteem
