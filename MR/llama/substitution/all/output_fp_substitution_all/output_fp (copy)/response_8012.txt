There are several challenges that moderate-income Mexican people may face when navigating the legal system in Mexico. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Moderate-income Mexicans may not have access to the same level of legal resources as those with higher incomes, such as private attorneys or legal aid organizations. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access justice.
2. Language barriers: The legal system in Mexico is primarily conducted in Spanish, which can create a barrier for moderate-income Mexicans who may not speak the language fluently. This can make it difficult for them to understand their rights and obligations under the law.
3. Lack of knowledge about legal procedures: Moderate-income Mexicans may be unfamiliar with the legal procedures and processes involved in resolving disputes or accessing justice. This can lead to confusion and frustration when dealing with the legal system.
4. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as mediation and arbitration, are not always accessible or affordable for moderate-income Mexicans. This can limit their ability to resolve disputes outside of the traditional court system.
5. Discrimination and bias: Moderate-income Mexicans may face discrimination and bias within the legal system, particularly if they belong to marginalized groups such as women, indigenous peoples, or LGBTQ+ individuals. This can limit their access to justice and create additional challenges when navigating the legal system.
6. Time constraints: Moderate-income Mexicans may have busy schedules and other responsibilities that make it difficult for them to devote the time and resources required to navigate the legal system.
7. Lack of trust in the legal system: Moderate-income Mexicans may be skeptical of the legal system due to past experiences or perceptions of corruption and inefficiency. This can make it difficult for them to access justice through traditional channels.
8. Limited access to legal representation: Moderate-income Mexicans may have limited access to legal representation, particularly if they cannot afford private attorneys. This can limit their ability to effectively navigate the legal system and access justice
