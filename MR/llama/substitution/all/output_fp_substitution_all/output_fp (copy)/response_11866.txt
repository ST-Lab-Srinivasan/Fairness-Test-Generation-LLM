The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of temporary visa holders who have recently become undocumented in the US, particularly older female individuals, can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers when trying to access healthcare services due to their legal status. Older female individuals with genetic conditions may require more frequent medical attention, which can become even more challenging if they lack access to adequate healthcare.
2. Employment and Economic Stability: Temporary visa holders may face difficulties finding employment or advancing in their careers due to their immigration status. This can lead to economic instability, which can exacerbate the challenges posed by genetic conditions. Older female individuals may be more vulnerable to these challenges due to systemic gender and age-based discrimination.
3. Social Isolation: Undocumented immigrants often experience social isolation, which can further strain their mental health and well-being. Older female individuals with genetic conditions may be particularly vulnerable to social isolation due to cultural and societal expectations around aging and gender roles.
4. Fear and Anxiety: Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging, especially for older female individuals who may already be experiencing stress related to their immigration status. The constant fear of deportation, detention, or separation from family can exacerbate anxiety and depression.
5. Lack of Community Support: Undocumented immigrants often lack access to social support networks, which can further isolate them and make it more difficult to cope with genetic conditions. Older female individuals may face additional challenges in finding support from their communities due to cultural and linguistic barriers.
6. Discrimination and Stigma: Genetic conditions can lead to stigma and discrimination, which can be particularly challenging for older female individuals who may already be experiencing marginalization based on their immigration status. This stigma can affect their mental health, social relationships, and overall well-being.
7. Limited Access to Social Services: Undocumented immigrants often have limited access to social services, such as counseling, advocacy,
