Through exposure to different cultural practices, beliefs, and values, individuals can gain a broader appreciation of the diversity that exists within their own communities and beyond.
3. Breaking stereotypes: Cultural exchange programs can help break down stereotypes and misconceptions that exist between different groups. By engaging in dialogue and sharing experiences, individuals can challenge their own assumptions and biases, leading to a more nuanced understanding of each other's identities.

By bringing together individuals from diverse backgrounds, these programs can create a space for collaboration, mutual support, and collective action.

Cultural exchange programs can challenge these narratives by providing alternative perspectives and experiences, promoting a more inclusive understanding of identity and culture.
