Financially disadvantaged ethnic Hispanic individuals face a number of obstacles when trying to access healthcare within the medical system. These difficulties include:

1. Limited access to health insurance: Financial constraints can limit access to health insurance, which is needed to pay for medical care and services. Many financially disadvantaged ethnic Hispanics may not be able to afford health insurance, or they may have limited coverage that does not include essential healthcare services.
2. Language barriers: For those who are not fluent in English, navigating the healthcare system can be challenging. Communication difficulties can lead to misunderstandings and errors in diagnosis and treatment, which can result in poor health outcomes.
3. Cultural differences: There may be cultural differences between ethnic Hispanics and the healthcare providers they encounter. For example, some ethnic Hispanics may have different expectations about their role in the medical decision-making process or different attitudes towards Western medicine.

These services may not be available in their area or they may require additional resources that are not accessible due to financial constraints.

Discrimination and stigma: Financially disadvantaged ethnic Hispanics may encounter discrimination and stigma within the healthcare system, which can further exacerbate existing health disparities. For example, they may be subject to racial or ethnic profiling, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care.

This can increase their risk of developing chronic conditions and exacerbate existing health disparities.
