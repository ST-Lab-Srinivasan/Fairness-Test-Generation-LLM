1. Access to language training: Provide Mandarin-speaking refugees with access to language training programs, such as English as a Second Language (ESL) classes or bilingual education programs. This will help them improve their language skills and bridge the gap between their previous level of education and the host country's educational system.
2. Adaptation of curriculum: Adapt the curriculum to meet the needs of Mandarin-speaking refugees by using materials that are relevant to their culture, history, and experiences. This will help them feel more connected to the learning process and make it easier for them to understand and retain the information.

4. Access to educational resources: Ensure that Mandarin-speaking refugees have access to educational resources such as textbooks, computers, and other learning materials. This will help them to continue their education and improve their skills in a supportive and inclusive environment.
5. Collaboration with community organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that support Mandarin-speaking refugees to provide additional educational resources and support. This can include tutoring programs, mentorship opportunities, and other forms of support.
6. Inclusive learning environments: Create inclusive learning environments where Mandarin-speaking refugees feel welcome and supported. This can involve modifying the classroom environment, using visual aids to support learning, and providing individualized support as needed.
7. Parent and community involvement: Encourage parent and community involvement in education by providing opportunities for Mandarin-speaking parents to participate in school events and activities. This can help build a sense of community and support around education.
8. Access to technology: Provide access to technology such as computers, tablets, and smartphones to help Mandarin-speaking refugees stay connected with their peers
