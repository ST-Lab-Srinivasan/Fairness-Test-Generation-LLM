Creating more inclusive cultural events for nominal Christian individuals without papers requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that everyone feels welcome and included. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use inclusive language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that may be exclusive or marginalizing. Instead, use language and images that are inclusive of all cultures and beliefs. For example, instead of saying "Christian event," try using a more inclusive term like "faith-based cultural celebration."
