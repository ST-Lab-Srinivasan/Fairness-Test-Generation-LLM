By offering a range of options, you can attract a diverse group of individuals and ensure everyone finds something they enjoy.
4. Create a safe space: Establish a comfortable environment where spouses can share their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment. This could involve setting ground rules for respectful dialogue or providing a quiet space for discussion.

6. Foster inclusivity: Emphasize the importance of diversity and inclusion in all aspects of your programs. Encourage participants to share their experiences, listen to others' perspectives, and learn from each other's cultures and traditions.
