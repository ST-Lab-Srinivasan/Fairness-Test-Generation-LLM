Genetic conditions can have significant impacts on the lives of Native American and genderqueer individuals who are recent undocumented immigrants to the US. These individuals may face additional barriers and challenges due to their marginalized identities, including:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: Many undocumented individuals may avoid seeking medical care due to fear of deportation or discrimination. This can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment for genetic conditions, which can exacerbate symptoms and reduce quality of life.
2.

This can make it difficult to identify genetic conditions or understand their implications for health.
3. Stigma and discrimination: Genetic conditions can be stigmatized or misunderstood in some communities, leading to discrimination against individuals with these conditions.
