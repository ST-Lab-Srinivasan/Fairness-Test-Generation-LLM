As a recent green card holder from Spain to Canada, there may be several challenges you could face within the legal system in Canada. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for Spanish speakers in Canada is the language barrier. While many Canadians speak English and French, not everyone may speak Spanish fluently. This can make it difficult to navigate the legal system, particularly when dealing with official documents or court proceedings.
2. Cultural differences: Canada has a different legal culture than Spain, with its own set of laws, regulations, and procedures. As a recent immigrant, you may find some cultural differences challenging, such as the way legal proceedings are conducted or the expectations around communication with lawyers and judges.
3. Lack of familiarity with Canadian laws: As a recent immigrant, you may not be familiar with Canadian laws and regulations, which can make it difficult to understand your rights and responsibilities within the legal system.
4. Difficulty accessing legal resources: Depending on where you live in Canada, there may be limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or community legal clinics. This can make it more challenging to navigate the legal system, particularly for those with limited financial means.
5. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist in many parts of Canada's legal system. As a recent immigrant from Spain, you may face discrimination or bias based on your race, ethnicity, or national origin. It is essential to be aware of these challenges and to seek support from organizations that can help you navigate the legal system.
6. Difficulty navigating Canadian administrative law: Canada has a complex administrative law system, which can be difficult to navigate for recent immigrants. This includes dealing with government agencies, such as Citizenship and Immigration Canada, and understanding the processes involved in obtaining a visa or residency permit.
7. Limited access to legal aid: While Canada has a comprehensive legal aid system, there may be limited access to these resources for recent immigrants, particularly those who are not eligible for free legal aid. This can make it more challenging to navigate the legal system and access the help you need.
