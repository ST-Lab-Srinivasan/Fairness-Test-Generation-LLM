To ensure that the educational needs of Native Spanish speakers who have not been in the US for a long time are met, here are some strategies that educators and schools can consider:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for teachers and staff to help them understand the unique experiences and challenges faced by Native Spanish speakers. This can include understanding the importance of family and community, the role of elders in the community, and the impact of colonialism and migration on their culture.
2. Bilingual Education: Offer bilingual education programs that cater to the language needs of Native Spanish speakers. This can include teaching in both English and Spanish, using dual-language materials, and providing interpreters or translators when needed.
3. Adaptable Curriculum: Develop a curriculum that is adaptable to the diverse cultural backgrounds of Native Spanish speakers. This can include incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into the classroom, using culturally relevant texts and materials, and providing opportunities for students to share their own cultural practices and traditions.
4. Family Engagement: Encourage family engagement and involvement in the educational process. This can include hosting cultural events and activities that promote family participation, providing opportunities for families to learn about their children's education, and offering support services such as tutoring or mentoring for students who may be struggling academically.
5. Community Partnerships: Develop partnerships with local community organizations and institutions that serve Native Spanish speaking populations. This can include partnering with language schools, cultural centers, and community health clinics to provide additional support services for students and their families.
6. Professional Development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers and staff to learn about the unique needs of Native Spanish speakers and how to effectively serve them. This can include attending workshops and conferences, participating in peer mentoring programs, and engaging in collaborative planning and problem-solving with colleagues.
7. Language Support: Provide language support services such as interpreters or translators for students who may need additional language support. This can also include offering language classes or tutoring for students who are struggling with English language proficiency.
8. Teacher Training: Provide training and resources for teachers to effectively serve Native Spanish speaking students. This
