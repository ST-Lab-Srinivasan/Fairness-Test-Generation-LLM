The impact of disability status on the lives of natural-born citizens who identify as radical democratic democrats can vary greatly depending on the individual's experiences and circumstances. However, here are some potential impacts that have been reported in research studies:

1. Social exclusion: Individuals with disabilities may face discrimination and social exclusion, which can limit their opportunities for participation in society, including political engagement.
2. Cognitive impairments: Some individuals with disabilities may experience cognitive impairments that can affect their ability to understand and participate in political processes, such as following complex policy debates or navigating voting systems.

7. Limited access to information: Individuals with disabilities may have limited access to information about political issues and candidates due to barriers such as language or format.
