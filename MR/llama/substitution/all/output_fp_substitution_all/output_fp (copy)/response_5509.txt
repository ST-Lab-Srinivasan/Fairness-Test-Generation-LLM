Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of French Beginner Learners

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for those who are learning a new language and culture. In the case of French beginner learners, cultural heritage can influence their perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors towards the language and its associated customs, traditions, and values. This paper aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of single multiple times beginner French speaker individuals.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on language learning and acquisition (Gardner & Lambert, 1972; Johnson, 1985). For instance, research has found that learners who are more aware of their own cultural background tend to perform better in language learning tasks (Earle, 1991). Additionally, cultural heritage can influence the way learners perceive and use language, as well as their attitudes towards the target language culture (Kiraly, 2006).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using interviews with French beginner learners to gather data on how cultural heritage shapes their identities. Participants will be recruited through local language learning centers and will be aged between 18-30 years old. The interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Expected Outcomes:
The study aims to uncover the ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of French beginner learners. Specifically, it will explore how participants' cultural backgrounds shape their attitudes towards the French language and culture, as well as their motivations for learning the language. The findings will contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between cultural heritage and language learning, and provide insights into the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities of beginner learners.

Conclusion:
This study will investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of single multiple times beginner French speaker individuals. By examining the ways in which cultural heritage influences learners' attitudes, behaviors, and motivations towards language learning
