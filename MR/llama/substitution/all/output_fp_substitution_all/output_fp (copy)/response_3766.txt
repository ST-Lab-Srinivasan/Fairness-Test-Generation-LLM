Discrimination against Nigerian non-citizens can have significant negative impacts on their mental health. Some potential consequences include:

1. Increased stress and anxiety: The constant fear of discrimination, racism, and xenophobia can lead to increased levels of stress and anxiety, which can affect mental health negatively.
2. Depression: The emotional toll of discrimination can lead to feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and low self-esteem, which can develop into clinical depression if left unaddressed.
3. PTSD: Nigerian non-citizens who have experienced trauma due to discrimination may develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can manifest as flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of triggers that remind them of the traumatic event.
4. Social isolation: Discrimination can lead to social isolation, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
5. Stigma and shame: The stigma associated with being a non-citizen can lead to feelings of shame and low self-esteem, which can further negatively impact mental health.
6. Difficulty accessing mental health services: Non-citizens may face barriers when trying to access mental health services due to language barriers, cultural differences, or lack of knowledge about available resources.
7. Intergenerational trauma: The effects of discrimination can be passed down through generations, leading to intergenerational trauma and mental health issues.
8. Lack of trust in institutions: Discrimination can erode trust in institutions, such as government agencies, schools, and healthcare systems, which can lead to feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness.
