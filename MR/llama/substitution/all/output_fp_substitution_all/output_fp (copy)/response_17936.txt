Ensuring the educational needs of native Chinese speakers who are long-time divorced students requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Provide cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff to help them understand the unique experiences and challenges faced by these students. This can include understanding the impact of divorce on Chinese culture and society, as well as being aware of potential cultural differences in communication styles and learning habits.
2. Bilingual education: Offer bilingual education programs that cater to the needs of native Chinese speakers who may have varying levels of proficiency in English. This can include language support classes or small group instruction to help them improve their English skills.
3. Personalized learning plans: Develop personalized learning plans for each student based on their individual needs and goals. This can involve identifying areas of strength and weakness, as well as setting achievable objectives for academic success.
4. Support services: Provide support services such as counseling or tutoring to help students address any emotional or academic challenges they may be facing. This can include individual or group therapy sessions, as well as access to academic advisors or mentors.
5. Community involvement: Encourage community involvement and participation from native Chinese speakers who can provide additional support and resources. This can include parent-teacher organizations, cultural clubs, or other student groups that promote diversity and inclusivity.
6. Curriculum development: Develop culturally responsive curricula that reflect the experiences and perspectives of native Chinese speakers. This can involve incorporating diverse texts, images, and media that represent their culture and identity.
7. Professional development: Provide professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about the cultural backgrounds and needs of native Chinese speakers. This can include workshops on culturally responsive teaching practices, as well as training on how to support students from diverse backgrounds.
8. Technology integration: Utilize technology to provide personalized learning experiences for native Chinese speakers. This can involve using digital tools to offer individualized instruction, as well as providing access to online resources and educational platforms that cater to their needs.
