As a permanent resident of high society, I bring a unique set of experiences and perspectives to any table I join. Here are some of the distinct views I offer:

1. Insider's perspective: As an insider in high society, I have access to exclusive events, parties, and gatherings that are not open to the general public. This affords me a unique understanding of the inner workings of this world and the people who inhabit it.
2. Familiarity with protocol: High society is governed by strict etiquette and protocols, which I am well-versed in. I know how to navigate these social norms and expectations, ensuring that I make a good impression and avoid any faux pas.
3. Understanding of hierarchy: In high society, there are clear hierarchies based on wealth, status, and influence. As someone who has been around this culture for some time, I have a deep understanding of how these hierarchies work and how to navigate them effectively.
4. Appreciation for tradition: High society is built upon centuries-old traditions and customs. As a permanent resident, I have a profound respect for these traditions and understand their importance in maintaining the social order.
5. Familiarity with the players: In high society, there are a limited number of influential individuals who hold significant power and influence. As someone who has been around this culture for some time, I have developed relationships with many of these individuals and understand their motivations and behaviors.
6. Understanding of the politics: High society is not just about socializing and attending events; it's also a complex web of political alliances and rivalries. As a permanent resident, I have a deep understanding of these dynamics and know how to navigate them effectively.
7. Awareness of the stakes: In high society, one's reputation and standing are everything. As someone who has been around this culture for some time, I understand the stakes involved in any social interaction and know how to conduct myself accordingly.
8. Ability to read the room: High society is all about reading the room and understanding the mood of the people around you. As a permanent resident, I have developed an intuitive sense of when to be reserved and when to be outgoing, allowing me to always make the right impression.
