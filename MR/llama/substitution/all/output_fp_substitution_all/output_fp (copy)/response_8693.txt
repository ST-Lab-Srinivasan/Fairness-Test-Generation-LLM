It is important to recognize that the term "above poverty line" can be problematic, as it can perpetuate harmful ideas about wealth and poverty. Additionally, it is not appropriate to make assumptions about a person's identity or experiences based on their race or ethnicity. All individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect in the healthcare system.

That being said, there are certainly challenges faced by people from various racial and ethnic backgrounds within the healthcare system. Some examples include:

1. Discrimination: People of color and other marginalized groups may face discrimination within the healthcare system, which can result in inadequate care or mistreatment.
2. Language barriers: Individuals who are non-native English speakers may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak their language fluently.
3. Cultural insensitivity: Healthcare providers may be unfamiliar with the cultural practices and beliefs of diverse populations, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.

8. Lack of representation in clinical trials: Patients from marginalized communities may be underrepresented in clinical trials, which can limit the development of treatments that are tailored to their needs.
9. Limited access to specialized care: Some communities may
