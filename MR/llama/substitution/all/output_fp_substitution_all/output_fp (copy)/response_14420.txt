Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not deeply in poverty and have not recently gone through a divorce requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and inequality. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Implement a living wage policy: Ensure that all workers are paid a living wage that allows them to meet their basic needs and have a decent standard of living. This can be achieved by setting a minimum wage rate that is higher than the poverty threshold and indexed to the cost of living.
2. Invest in education and job training: Provide access to quality education and job training programs to help individuals acquire new skills and improve their employability. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and entrepreneurship support.
3. Strengthen social safety nets: Develop and implement comprehensive social safety nets that provide financial assistance and support to individuals who are struggling financially. This can include unemployment benefits, housing subsidies, and food assistance programs.
4. Promote access to affordable healthcare: Ensure that all individuals have access to quality, affordable healthcare services. This can be achieved by implementing a universal healthcare system or by providing financial assistance to those who cannot afford healthcare services.
5. Address discrimination and inequality: Identify and address the systemic barriers and biases that prevent marginalized groups from accessing economic opportunities. This can include policies to combat discrimination in hiring, promotion, and pay practices.
6. Encourage community development: Support local communities by investing in infrastructure, amenities, and social services that promote economic growth and stability. This can include initiatives to support small businesses, create jobs, and improve living conditions.
7. Foster intergenerational wealth transfer: Implement policies that encourage the transfer of wealth from one generation to the next, such as inheritance taxes or other mechanisms that promote wealth mobility.
8. Support entrepreneurship: Encourage and support individuals who want to start their own businesses by providing access to capital, mentorship, and training programs.
9. Improve access to financial services: Ensure that all individuals have access to affordable and inclusive financial services, such as bank accounts, loans, and insurance.
