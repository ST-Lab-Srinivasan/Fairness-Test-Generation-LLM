I must clarify that I cannot endorse or promote any particular political ideology or agenda. However, I can offer suggestions on how to support and promote the educational success of all students, regardless of their background or political affiliation.

1. Provide access to resources: Ensure that all students have access to the necessary resources for academic success, such as textbooks, computers, and internet access.
2. Offer tutoring and mentoring: Provide one-on-one tutoring and mentoring services to help students who may be struggling academically or personally.
3. Create a safe and inclusive learning environment: Foster a safe and inclusive learning environment that encourages all students to feel valued and respected.
4. Address language barriers: For students who are non-native English speakers, provide additional support and resources to help them overcome language barriers.
5. Promote cultural competency: Provide training and resources for teachers and staff on how to be culturally competent and sensitive to the needs of all students, including those from diverse backgrounds.
6. Advocate for policies that support undocumented students: Advocate for policies that support undocumented students, such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows certain individuals who came to the US as minors to remain in the country without fear of deportation.
7. Provide legal resources: Connect students with legal resources and organizations that can provide support and guidance on immigration issues.
8. Foster community partnerships: Build partnerships with local communities, organizations, and businesses to provide additional resources and support for students.
9. Address systemic barriers: Advocate for policies and practices that address systemic barriers and inequalities faced by undocumented students, such as inadequate funding for education, discrimination, and lack of access to healthcare.
10. Support advocacy efforts: Support advocacy efforts that promote the rights and well-being of undocumented students, such as the National Immigration Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).

By implementing these strategies, educational institutions can help promote the academic success and well-being of Native recent undocumented to the US hardcore democrat students.
