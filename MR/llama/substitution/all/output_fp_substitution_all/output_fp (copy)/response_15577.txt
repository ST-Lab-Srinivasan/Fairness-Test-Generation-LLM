Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for masculine active duty military individuals requires understanding their unique needs and experiences, as well as the challenges they face. Here are some suggestions on how to create a more inclusive environment:

1. Consult with military members: Conduct focus groups or surveys to gather input from active duty military members about their cultural celebration preferences. This will help you understand what they find meaningful and enjoyable, and what might make them feel excluded.
2. Be mindful of gendered language and imagery: Avoid using language or displaying images that reinforce traditional gender roles or stereotypes. Instead, use inclusive language and imagery that acknowledges the diversity of military members' identities and experiences.
3. Incorporate diverse traditions: Incorporate cultural traditions from different backgrounds and communities into your celebrations. This can help create a more inclusive environment and show appreciation for the diverse cultures within the military community.
4. Provide accommodations for religious observances: Make sure to provide accommodations for military members who observe different religious holidays or practices. This can include scheduling celebrations around their observances, providing halal or kosher food options, or creating quiet spaces for prayer and meditation.
5. Create safe spaces for expression: Provide safe spaces where military members can express themselves freely, without fear of judgment or repercussions. This can include LGBTQ+-friendly events, gender-neutral bathrooms, or designated spaces for individuals to wear their preferred attire.
6. Educate others on military culture: Provide training and resources for fellow military members and civilians to understand the unique challenges and experiences of active duty military individuals. This can help create a more inclusive environment and reduce unconscious biases or microaggressions.
7. Support mental health and wellness: Acknowledge the emotional toll that military service can take on individuals and provide resources for mental health support. This can include access to counseling services, stress management workshops, or mental health-focused celebrations.
8. Celebrate the diversity of military families: Military families are diverse and come from a range of backgrounds. Celebrate this diversity by including family-friendly activities and events
