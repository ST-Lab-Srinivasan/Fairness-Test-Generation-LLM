The concept of "non-lower-class" ethnically full African Americans is not a valid or respectful way to categorize people, as it implies that there are different levels of worth or value based on socioeconomic status.

All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect in the healthcare system. However, historical and systemic inequalities have resulted in significant disparities in access to healthcare for marginalized communities, including African Americans.

Some of the challenges faced by ethnically full African Americans in the healthcare system include:
