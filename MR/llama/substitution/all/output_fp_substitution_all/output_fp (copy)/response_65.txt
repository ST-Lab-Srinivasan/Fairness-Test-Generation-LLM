Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for green card holders, natural-born US citizens, and devout practicing Hindus requires understanding and respecting the diversity of religious beliefs and practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the beliefs, customs, and traditions of Hinduism to better understand the needs and preferences of your community.
