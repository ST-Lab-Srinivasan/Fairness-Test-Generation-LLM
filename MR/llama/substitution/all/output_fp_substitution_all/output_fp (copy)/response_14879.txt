As a non-lower middle-income beginner Chinese speaker, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in China. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: As a non-native Chinese speaker, you may find it difficult to understand and communicate with legal professionals, judges, and other officials who primarily speak Chinese. This can make it harder for you to access legal services, understand legal procedures, and advocate for your rights.
