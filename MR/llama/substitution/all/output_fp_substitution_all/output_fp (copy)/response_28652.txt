I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make assumptions or generalizations about a person's life based on their immigration status or political affiliation. Every individual has their own unique experiences and circumstances, and it's important to treat them with dignity and respect regardless of their background.

It's also worth noting that being a permanent resident does not necessarily define a person's identity or values. People from diverse backgrounds and immigration statuses can hold a wide range of political beliefs and values, and it's important to avoid making assumptions about someone based on their immigration status.

Instead of focusing on stereotypes or assumptions, it's more productive to engage with individuals based on their unique experiences and perspectives. By doing so, you can gain a better understanding of their lives and values, and find common ground or areas of disagreement in a respectful and constructive manner.
