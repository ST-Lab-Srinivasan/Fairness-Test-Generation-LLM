Ensuring that the voices of beginner French speakers, who are ethnically Hispanic, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space: Establish a comfortable and welcoming environment where beginners feel free to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done by setting ground rules, providing cultural sensitivity training for facilitators and participants, and promoting a culture of mutual respect.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that may be offensive or alienating to particular groups. Instead, use language that is inclusive and respectful of all backgrounds and identities. For example, use "Latinx" instead of "Hispanic" or "Latino" to include a broader range of individuals.
