Promoting the educational success of autistic students, particularly those with moderate levels of autism, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Individualized Education Program (IEP): Develop an IEP that outlines specific goals, objectives, and accommodations tailored to the student's strengths, weaknesses, and learning style. Regularly review and update the IEP to ensure it remains relevant and effective.
2. Structured Learning Environment: Create a structured and predictable learning environment that caters to the student's sensory processing needs. This can involve using visual schedules, routines, and cues to help them stay organized and focused.
3. Teacher Training: Provide teachers with training on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and how to teach students with autism. This can include understanding the unique characteristics of ASD, communication strategies, and behavior management techniques.
4. Paraprofessional Support: Assign a paraprofessional, such as a special education teacher or instructional assistant, to work closely with the student and provide additional support in the classroom. This can include breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps, providing visual supports, and using positive behavioral interventions.
5. Social Skills Training: Offer social skills training to help students develop and improve their social interactions, communication, and relationships with peers and teachers. This can involve group activities, role-playing exercises, and one-on-one coaching.
6. Sensory Integration Therapy: Provide sensory integration therapy to help students process and integrate sensory information from their environment. This can involve activities such as brushing, joint movement, and swinging, which can help regulate the student's sensory system.
7. Communication Supports: Use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies, such as picture communication symbols, gestures, or electronic devices, to help students communicate more effectively.
8. Adapted Curriculum: Modify the curriculum to meet the student's individual needs and learning style. This can involve breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps, providing visual supports, and using hands-on activities to help students learn and retain information.
9. Behavior
