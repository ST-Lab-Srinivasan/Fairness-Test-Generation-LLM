Lower middle-income recent temporary visa holders to Canada may face several challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Lack of Knowledge and Understanding: Many temporary visa holders may not be familiar with the Canadian legal system, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complex rules and procedures. They may struggle to understand their rights and obligations as non-citizens in Canada.
2. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Lower middle-income individuals may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid services, and other forms of support. This can make it harder for them to seek legal advice and representation when needed.
3. Language Barriers: Temporary visa holders who are not fluent in French or English may face difficulties communicating with legal professionals, courts, and other government agencies. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and missed opportunities for legal assistance.
4. Difficulty Proving Eligibility: To access certain legal services or benefits, temporary visa holders may need to prove their eligibility. This can be challenging, especially if they do not have the necessary documents or proof of their immigration status.
5. Limited Timeframe: Temporary visa holders often have a limited timeframe in which to resolve their legal issues. For example, they may have to leave Canada before their visa expires or face deportation. This can create a sense of urgency and stress that can be difficult to manage.
6. Cultural Barriers: Temporary visa holders may face cultural barriers when interacting with the legal system in Canada. For example, they may have different expectations about how legal proceedings should unfold or what constitutes appropriate behavior in a courtroom.
7. Limited Financial Resources: Lower middle-income temporary visa holders may struggle to pay for legal services, which can limit their access to legal assistance. This can make it harder for them to pursue legal remedies or defend themselves in court.
8. Fear of Deportation: Many temporary visa holders may be undocumented or have a pending deportation case. This can create significant fear and anxiety, which can impact their ability to seek legal assistance or navigate the legal system
