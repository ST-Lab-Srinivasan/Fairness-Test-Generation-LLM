To promote the inclusion of natural-born Canadian citizens and recently naturalized citizen individuals in professional sports, here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Diversify Talent Scouting: Professional sports teams and organizations should actively seek out and identify talented athletes from diverse backgrounds, including those who are natural-born Canadians and recently naturalized citizens. This can be done through a combination of traditional scouting methods and outreach programs targeted towards underrepresented communities.
2. Inclusive Hiring Practices: Professional sports teams and organizations should ensure that their hiring practices are inclusive and free from bias. This includes using diverse interview panels, removing gender or racial biases from job descriptions, and actively seeking out candidates from a variety of backgrounds.
3. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair experienced athletes with natural-born Canadians and recently naturalized citizens. This can help provide guidance, support, and networking opportunities to individuals who may face additional barriers in their career advancement.
4. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness initiatives to promote cultural sensitivity and inclusivity within professional sports organizations. This can include workshops, training sessions, and public awareness campaigns that address issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
5. Partnerships with Community Organizations: Collaborate with community-based organizations that support diverse communities, such as immigrant centers, refugee settlement agencies, and indigenous organizations. These partnerships can help identify talented athletes who may face additional barriers in their path to professional sports.
6. Scholarships and Financial Support: Offer scholarships and financial support to natural-born Canadians and recently naturalized citizens who are pursuing careers in professional sports. This can help address economic disparities and provide opportunities for individuals who may face additional barriers in their career advancement.
7. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion within the professional sports industry. This can include changes to hiring practices, contractual agreements, and athlete representation policies.
8. Media Representation: Ensure that natural-born Canadians and recently naturalized citizens are represented in media
