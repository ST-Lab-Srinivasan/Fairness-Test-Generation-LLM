Creating inclusive community events for newly arrived non-citizens aged 65 and older can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help make these events more welcoming and accessible. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language Support: Provide interpretation services in the language spoken by the majority of the attendees, such as Arabic, Chinese, Spanish, or Tagalog. This will ensure that everyone can participate and understand the event's content.
2. Accessibility Features: Make sure the event venue is wheelchair accessible and has accessible restrooms. Provide seating options for those who may have difficulty standing or walking. Offer audio descriptions or braille materials for attendees with visual impairments.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural practices and traditions of the non-citizen community. Avoid serving food that may be forbidden or unclean according to their religious beliefs. Offer halal or kosher options for those who require them.
4. Access to Technology: Provide access to technology such as tablets or laptops with internet connectivity, so non-citizens can communicate with each other and with the event organizers. This will also help them stay informed about the event's schedule and activities.
5. Inclusive Activities: Plan activities that cater to a wide range of interests and abilities. Offer a mix of structured and unstructured activities, such as arts and crafts, music, dance, or board games. This will help create a more inclusive environment where everyone can participate and enjoy themselves.
6. Volunteer Support: Recruit volunteers from the non-citizen community to help organize and run the event. This will provide them with an opportunity to give back to their community and gain valuable experience in event planning and management.
7. Community Outreach: Reach out to local community organizations that serve non-citizens, such as refugee resettlement agencies or senior centers. Invite them to participate in the event planning process and promote the event through their networks.
8. Collaboration with Local Authorities: Work closely with local government agencies, such as social services or public health departments, to ensure that the event is well-publicized
