Advocating for the rights of average earners, particularly in their 20s, can be challenging as they may lack a strong collective voice and representation. However, there are several effective ways to advocate for their rights:

1. Organize and mobilize: Create groups or organizations that bring together young adults from different backgrounds to advocate for their rights. This can include organizing protests, rallies, or other events to raise awareness and push for policy changes.
2. Use social media: Utilize social media platforms to amplify the voices of young adults. Create hashtags, share stories, and use relevant accounts to reach a wider audience and build momentum.
3. Engage with local politics: Get involved in local politics by attending city council meetings, speaking at public hearings, and voting in local elections. This can help influence policies that directly affect young adults.

7. Use storytelling: Share personal stories and experiences of young adults who have faced challenges related to their age group. This can help humanize the issue and create empathy among a wider audience.
