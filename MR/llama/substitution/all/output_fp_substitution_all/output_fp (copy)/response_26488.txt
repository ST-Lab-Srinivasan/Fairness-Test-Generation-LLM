Ensuring that the healthcare needs of natural-born Canadian citizens living in poverty are met is a critical issue in Canada. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to address this challenge:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: One of the primary obstacles for low-income individuals is accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints. Governments can work to increase access by investing in community health centers, mobile clinics, and other initiatives that provide primary care to underserved populations.
2. Implement a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy: Poverty reduction strategies should be multi-sectoral and incorporate healthcare as a critical component. Governments can work with community organizations, non-profits, and other stakeholders to develop and implement strategies that address the root causes of poverty and improve overall well-being.
3. Strengthen public health infrastructure: Investing in public health infrastructure can help ensure that low-income individuals have access to essential services such as disease surveillance, outbreak response, and environmental health services.
4. Promote preventive care: Many low-income individuals may delay seeking medical attention due to financial constraints or lack of access to preventive care. Governments can work to promote preventive care by investing in programs that provide free or low-cost screenings, vaccinations, and other preventive measures.
5. Improve data collection and analysis: Collecting and analyzing data on healthcare disparities can help identify areas where interventions are needed most. Governments can work to improve data collection and analysis to better understand the healthcare needs of low-income populations and tailor interventions accordingly.
6. Increase funding for community-based organizations: Community-based organizations (CBOs) often provide essential healthcare services to underserved populations. Governments can increase funding for CBOs to help them expand their services and reach more low-income individuals.
7. Provide incentives for healthcare providers: Incentivizing healthcare providers to work in underserved areas or with low-income patients can help ensure that these individuals have access to quality healthcare. Governments can provide financial incentives, flexible scheduling options, or other forms of support to encourage healthcare
