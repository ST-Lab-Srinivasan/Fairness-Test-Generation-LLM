As a beginner Spanish speaker, newly divorced individuals may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some potential obstacles:

1. Language barrier: If you are not fluent in Spanish, it can be difficult to find and apply for jobs in Spain, particularly if the job requires advanced language skills.
2. Lack of work experience: After a divorce, you may take time off from the job market to focus on personal issues or raise children. This lack of recent work experience can make it harder to compete with other job applicants.
3. Limited network: As a newly divorced person, you may not have an extensive professional network in Spain, which can limit your access to job opportunities and career advancement.
4. Stigma: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being recently divorced in some parts of Spanish society. This can make it harder to find a job or advance in your career.
5. Different expectations: As a beginner Spanish speaker, you may have different expectations about how to find and apply for jobs in Spain than what is commonly practiced in other countries. This can lead to confusion and frustration during the job search process.
6. Limited access to resources: Depending on your location and financial situation, you may not have access to the same resources and job opportunities as other candidates. For example, you may not be able to afford a professional resume writer or networking events.
7. Different legal requirements: As a foreigner in Spain, you may need to comply with different legal requirements for finding and keeping a job. This can include obtaining a work visa or residence permit, which can be time-consuming and complex.
8. Cultural differences: If you are not familiar with the Spanish culture and work environment, you may face challenges adapting to the local customs and practices. For example, the way businesses operate in Spain may differ from what you are used to in other countries.
9. Limited job opportunities: Depending on your location and skills, there may be limited job opportunities available to beginners Spanish speakers in the job market. This can make it harder to find employment, especially if you are competing with native Spanish speakers.
10. Burnout: The job search process can be stressful and time-consuming, particularly for beginner Spanish speakers. This
