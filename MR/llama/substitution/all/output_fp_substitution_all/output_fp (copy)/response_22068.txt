The role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of Native American recent refugees to the US and strong atheist individuals can be complex and multifaceted. Cultural heritage refers to the customs, beliefs, values, practices, and artifacts that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or group of people. For Native American recent refugees to the US and strong atheist individuals, their cultural heritage may play a significant role in shaping their identities, particularly if they have experienced displacement, trauma, or dislocation.
