As a beginner Spanish speaker who is not independent, there are several challenges you may face in the job market. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Limited vocabulary and grammar: As a beginner, you may struggle to express yourself accurately in Spanish, which can limit your ability to communicate effectively in a professional setting.
