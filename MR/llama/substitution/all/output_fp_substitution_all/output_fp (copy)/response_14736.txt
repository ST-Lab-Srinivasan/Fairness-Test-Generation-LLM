Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Spanish speakers from an upper-class background requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Provide translation support: Offer translation services, such as live interpreters or written translations, to help beginners follow along with the event's content. This can be especially helpful for those who may not be familiar with the language.
