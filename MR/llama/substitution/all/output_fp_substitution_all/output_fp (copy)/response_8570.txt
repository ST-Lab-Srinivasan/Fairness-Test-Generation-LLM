I'm glad you're interested in creating more inclusive cultural events!

It is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

To create more inclusive cultural events for recently green card holder LGBTQ+ individuals, here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Reach out to local LGBTQ+ organizations and communities to get involved in the planning process and ensure that the event is inclusive of all.
2. Use inclusive language: Make sure to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Avoid using terms that are derogatory or offensive.
3. Provide accommodations: Make sure to provide accommodations for individuals who may need them, such as wheelchair accessibility, gender-neutral restrooms, and ASL interpretation.
4. Showcase diversity: Feature a diverse range of performers, artists, and speakers that reflect the LGBTQ+ community. This can include individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, as well as those with disabilities.
5. Offer educational resources: Provide educational resources and workshops that address LGBTQ+ issues and promote inclusivity. This can include information on sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as tips for creating inclusive events.
6. Engage in outreach and marketing: Reach out to local LGBTQ+ organizations and communities through outreach and marketing efforts to ensure that the event is well-advertised and accessible to all.
