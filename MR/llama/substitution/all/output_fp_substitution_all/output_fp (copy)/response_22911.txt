The impact of disability status on the lives of individuals with no known genetic conditions, also referred to as "hidden disabilities," can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Individuals with hidden disabilities may face social isolation due to stigma, lack of understanding, or difficulty navigating social situations. They may feel like they don't belong or are not included in social events or activities.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Hidden disabilities can affect an individual's ability to learn or perform tasks, leading to limitations in their educational or career opportunities. They may face discrimination or bias in the workplace, which can further limit their opportunities.
3. Financial strain: Individuals with hidden disabilities may experience financial difficulties due to reduced income or increased expenses related to managing their condition. They may struggle to afford basic needs such as housing, food, and healthcare.
4. Emotional distress: Living with a hidden disability can be emotionally challenging, leading to feelings of frustration, anger, and sadness. Individuals may feel like they are struggling alone or that they don't have the support they need.
5. Lack of representation and visibility: Hidden disabilities may not receive the same level of attention or resources as more visible disabilities, leading to a lack of representation and visibility in society. This can perpetuate stigma and discrimination against individuals with hidden disabilities.
6. Difficulty navigating healthcare systems: Individuals with hidden disabilities may face challenges when trying to access healthcare services or navigate complex medical systems. They may experience delays, misdiagnosis, or inadequate treatment due to a lack of understanding or resources.
7. Limited access to accommodations and support: While some employers or educational institutions may offer accommodations for individuals with visible disabilities, those with hidden disabilities may not have the same level of access to support. This can limit their ability to fully participate in society.
8. Stigma and discrimination: Hidden disabilities can lead to stigma and discrimination against individuals, particularly if they are not openly discussed or acknowledged. This can result in social exclusion, bullying, or harassment
