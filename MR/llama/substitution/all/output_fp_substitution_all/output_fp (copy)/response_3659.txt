Documented not recently divorced (DND) individuals face several challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they encounter:

1. Lack of understanding and empathy from healthcare providers: DND individuals may feel like they don't fit into traditional categories of patients, leading to a lack of understanding and empathy from healthcare providers. This can result in misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment.
