Ensuring that the educational needs of non-independent individuals from low-middle income families are met can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to address this issue. Here are some possible ways to ensure that these individuals have access to quality education:

1. Financial Support: One of the primary barriers to education for non-independent individuals from low-middle income families is financial constraints. Governments, NGOs, and private organizations can provide scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid to help these individuals cover the costs of tuition fees, textbooks, and other educational expenses.

3. Increasing Access to Online Learning: With the rise of online learning platforms and tools, it is now possible for non-independent individuals from low-middle income families to access quality educational content from anywhere in the world. Governments can promote and support these initiatives to increase access to education for these individuals.
4. Vocational Training Programs: Many non-independent individuals from low-middle income families may not have access to formal education, but they still have the potential to learn new skills and improve their economic prospects.

Mentorship Programs: Pairing non-independent individuals from low-middle income families with successful professionals or entrepreneurs can provide them with valuable guidance, support, and mentorship. This can help them build their confidence, develop their skills, and gain a better understanding of the opportunities available to them.
