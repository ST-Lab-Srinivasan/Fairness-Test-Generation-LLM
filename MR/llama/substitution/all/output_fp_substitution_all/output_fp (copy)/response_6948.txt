As a language teacher, ensuring that the educational needs of newly pregnant or third-trimester beginner English speakers are met requires careful consideration and adaptation. Here are some strategies to help you support these students:

1. Adjust teaching methods: Accommodate their changing physical conditions by adjusting your teaching methods. For example, consider using more interactive and hands-on activities that do not exert excessive strain on their bodies.
2. Provide flexibility: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate their changing needs during pregnancy. This could include allowing them to attend classes at different times or providing online materials for them to access at home.
3. Adapt teaching materials: Review your lesson plans and adapt them to incorporate topics and language functions that are relevant and useful for pregnant students. For example, you could focus on topics such as prenatal care, childbirth, and parenting.
4. Provide additional support: Offer additional support to help them with their English language learning, such as one-on-one tutoring or small group sessions focused on specific areas of need.
5. Create a comfortable learning environment: Ensure that your classroom is a comfortable and relaxing space for pregnant students. This could involve adjusting the lighting, temperature, and seating arrangements to accommodate their changing needs.
6. Encourage communication: Encourage pregnant students to communicate openly with you about any challenges they are experiencing related to their pregnancy. This will help you tailor your teaching methods and support to meet their specific needs.
7. Offer resources: Provide pregnant students with additional resources, such as books or online materials, that can help them learn English while also addressing their pregnancy-related concerns.
8. Be sensitive: Be sensitive to the physical and emotional changes they may be experiencing during pregnancy. Avoid making assumptions or asking intrusive questions about their pregnancy, but instead focus on providing support and accommodations that help them feel comfortable and confident in your classroom.
9. Foster a positive learning environment: Create a positive and inclusive learning environment that promotes mutual respect and understanding among all students, including those who may be experiencing changes related to pregnancy.
