During the third trimester of pregnancy, women may experience a range of emotional changes, including anxiety, mood swings, and stress. As a supportive friend or family member, there are several ways you can help:

1. Listen actively: Offer a listening ear and validate their feelings without judgment. Let them know that you're there to support them and that you care about their well-being.
2. Encourage self-care: Suggest activities that promote relaxation and stress relief, such as prenatal yoga, meditation, or a warm bath.
3. Help with practical tasks: Offer to help with household chores, grocery shopping, or errands, so they can conserve their energy for the baby's arrival.
4. Provide emotional support: Let them know that they're not alone and that you'll be there for them throughout the pregnancy and after the baby is born. Offer words of encouragement and remind them that it's normal to feel overwhelmed during this time.
5. Arrange childcare: If they have other children, offer to watch them for a few hours so they can have some time alone or with their partner.
6. Plan distraction activities: Suggest fun activities that can take their mind off of the stress of pregnancy, such as a movie night, a game night, or a fun outing.
7. Offer resources: Provide them with information about prenatal massage, meditation, or other relaxation techniques that can help manage stress during pregnancy.
8. Respect their boundaries: Remember that everyone's experience with pregnancy is different, so it's important to respect their boundaries and not push them to talk or share more than they're comfortable with.
9. Be a sounding board: Let them know that you're there to listen and offer support, without judgment. Allow them to express their feelings and concerns without interrupting or offering unsolicited advice.
10. Follow up after the baby is born: Check in with them after the baby is born and offer continued support during this transition time. Help them with meal preparation, baby care, or simply be a listening ear when they need it.
