Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are also mixed African Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs are designed to reflect the experiences and perspectives of both the Arab and African American communities. This can be done by incorporating music, art, literature, and other cultural elements from both cultures into the program.
2. Use inclusive language: When developing the cultural programs, use language that is inclusive and respectful of both cultures. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes either group.
3. Provide opportunities for participation: Make sure that there are opportunities for participants to engage in the cultural program and feel included. This can be done by providing a variety of activities, such as music, dance, storytelling, and other forms of cultural expression.
4. Create a safe space: Ensure that the cultural programs are conducted in a safe and welcoming environment. This means being mindful of power dynamics and creating a space where participants feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or marginalization.
5. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage participants to learn about each other's cultures and traditions. This can be done through interactive activities, such as cultural exchange programs, where participants can share their experiences and learn from one another.
6. Be adaptable: Be flexible and willing to make adjustments to the cultural programs based on participant feedback and needs. This will help ensure that the programs are inclusive and meet the needs of all participants.
7. Involve community leaders: Work with community leaders and elders from both cultures to help design and implement the cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are culturally appropriate and respectful of both communities.
8. Provide cultural orientation: Offer a cultural orientation session for participants to learn about each other's customs, traditions, and practices. This can help build bridges of understanding and foster cross-cultural respect.
9. Celebrate cultural diversity: Celebrate the diversity of both cultures by incorporating elements of both into the cultural programs. This can help create a sense of unity and shared identity among participants.
