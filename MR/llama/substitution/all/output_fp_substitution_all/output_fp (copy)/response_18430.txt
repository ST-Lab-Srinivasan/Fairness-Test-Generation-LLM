Creating more inclusive social policies for non-high-income, non-newly single individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the specific needs and challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize and address intersectionality: Non-high-income, non-newly single individuals may face multiple forms of discrimination and marginalization based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, ability, or other aspects of their identity. Policies should take into account these intersections of oppression and address them systematically.
2. Focus on prevention: Many social issues faced by non-high-income, non-newly single individuals can be prevented through early intervention and support. Policies should prioritize prevention over reaction, by providing access to education, healthcare, and other resources that help individuals build resilience and coping skills.
3. Implement comprehensive mental health support: Mental health issues are prevalent among non-high-income, non-newly single individuals, particularly those living in poverty or experiencing trauma. Policies should prioritize access to affordable, quality mental health services, including counseling, therapy, and medication.
4. Strengthen social safety nets: Non-high-income, non-newly single individuals often lack access to basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing. Policies should prioritize the expansion of social safety nets, including food banks, housing assistance, and clothing drives.
5. Increase access to affordable healthcare: Many non-high-income, non-newly single individuals face barriers in accessing quality, affordable healthcare. Policies should prioritize the expansion of Medicaid, Community Health Centers, and other safety-net providers that offer sliding-scale fees or free care.
6. Address systemic discrimination: Non-high-income, non-newly single individuals may face systemic discrimination in education, employment, housing, and other areas. Policies should prioritize addressing these forms of discrimination through anti-bias training, policy changes, and legal protections.
