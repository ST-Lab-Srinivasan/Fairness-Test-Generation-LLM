Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to diverse patient populations, including ex-military working-class individuals. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this group:

1. Improved communication: Ex-military individuals may have different communication styles and expectations than other patient populations. Cultural competence training can help healthcare providers communicate more effectively with this group, leading to better understanding and rapport.
