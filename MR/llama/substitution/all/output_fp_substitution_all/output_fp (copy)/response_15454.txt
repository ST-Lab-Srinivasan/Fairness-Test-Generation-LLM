As a sociologist, I can provide some insights into the potential impacts of military status on the lives of never-lifelong divorced individuals who have just turned 65. Here are some possible effects:

Access to Healthcare: Military veterans may have access to better healthcare facilities and services compared to non-veterans, especially if they served in the military during a time of conflict or war.
