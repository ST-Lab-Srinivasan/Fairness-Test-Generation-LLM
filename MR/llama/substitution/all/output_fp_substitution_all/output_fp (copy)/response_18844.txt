The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of older, lower-class individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Reduced quality of life: Genetic conditions can lead to chronic illnesses, disabilities, or cognitive decline, which can significantly reduce an individual's quality of life. Older, lower-class individuals may face additional challenges in accessing healthcare and other resources that could improve their quality of life.
2. Financial burden: Genetic conditions can result in increased medical expenses, lost productivity, and other financial burdens. Lower-class individuals may struggle to afford the costs associated with managing a genetic condition, which can further exacerbate economic inequality.
3. Social isolation: Genetic conditions can lead to social isolation, as older individuals may experience decreased mobility or be unable to participate in social activities due to their condition. Lower-class individuals may face additional challenges in accessing social support networks and resources.
4. Lack of access to healthcare: Older, lower-class individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including genetic testing and counseling, due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area. This can limit their ability to understand and manage their genetic condition.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Genetic conditions can lead to social stigma and discrimination, which can further affect the mental health and well-being of older, lower-class individuals. They may face additional challenges in accessing support and resources due to societal attitudes towards genetic conditions.
6. Limited opportunities for education and employment: Genetic conditions can impact an individual's cognitive abilities and physical capabilities, limiting their opportunities for education and employment. Lower-class individuals may face additional challenges in accessing educational and career opportunities due to systemic barriers and biases.
7. Impact on family dynamics: Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on family dynamics, particularly in lower-class families where there may be limited financial and social support. Older, lower-class individuals may face additional challenges in managing their condition while also caring for loved ones.
8. Limited access to genetic counseling: Older, lower-class individuals may have limited access
