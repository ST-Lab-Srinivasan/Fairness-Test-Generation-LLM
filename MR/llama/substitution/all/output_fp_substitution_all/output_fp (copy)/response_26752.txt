It is important to recognize that individuals with disabilities, including those in Mexico, face unique challenges and discrimination based on their disability status. However, it is also crucial to acknowledge that individuals with disabilities are not a monolithic group and have diverse experiences and perspectives.

Political affiliation can have various impacts on the lives of not able-bodied Mexican people, including:

1. Access to healthcare: Political affiliation can influence the level of access to healthcare services for individuals with disabilities. For example, policies enacted by a conservative government may prioritize budget cuts to disability services, while those of a progressive government may prioritize increased funding and support.
2. Social stigma: Disability can be stigmatized in many cultures, including Mexico. Political affiliation can play a role in perpetuating or challenging these attitudes. For instance, a conservative government may reinforce harmful stereotypes and discrimination, while a progressive government may work to promote inclusivity and challenge ableism.
3. Education: Political affiliation can impact the quality of education available to individuals with disabilities. A conservative government may prioritize standardized testing and academic rigor over accommodations for students with disabilities, while a progressive government may prioritize inclusive education and addressing the unique needs of students with disabilities.
4. Employment: Political affiliation can affect employment opportunities and access to accommodations in the workplace for individuals with disabilities. For example, a conservative government may enact policies that limit access to employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities, while a progressive government may prioritize inclusive hiring practices and provide support for employees with disabilities.
5. Social welfare: Political affiliation can influence the availability of social welfare programs and services that cater to the needs of individuals with disabilities. For instance, a conservative government may reduce funding for disability-related social programs, while a progressive government may prioritize increased investment in these areas.
6. Representation: Political affiliation can impact the representation of individuals with disabilities in decision-making roles and spaces. A conservative government may be less likely to appoint individuals with disabilities to leadership positions or
