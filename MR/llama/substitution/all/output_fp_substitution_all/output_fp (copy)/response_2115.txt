Addressing the specific needs of ethnically full African American, non-married, multiple times individuals in education requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers to understand and appreciate the cultural backgrounds of their students, including their experiences, beliefs, values, and practices. This can involve incorporating diverse perspectives and representations in curriculum development, lesson planning, and classroom activities.
2. Identity-based mentorship: Provide mentorship opportunities that are tailored to the unique needs and experiences of ethnically full African American students. This can involve pairing these students with mentors who share their cultural identity and experiences, and providing a safe space for them to discuss their challenges and aspirations.
3. Supportive classroom environment: Create a classroom environment that is inclusive, supportive, and respectful of all students' cultural backgrounds. This can involve promoting positive dialogue and interactions among students, celebrating diverse cultures and traditions, and providing opportunities for students to share their perspectives and experiences.
4. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that may exist in the education system, such as lack of access to resources, biases in curriculum development, and discrimination in hiring practices. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, such as targeted funding for underrepresented groups, diverse hiring practices, and culturally responsive curriculum development.
5. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local communities, organizations, and institutions that support the educational and cultural needs of ethnically full African American students. This can involve providing opportunities for students to engage in community-based learning, mentorship, and leadership development, as well as partnering with community organizations to provide support services such as tutoring, counseling, and mentorship.
6. Family engagement: Engage with the families of ethnically full African American students to promote their involvement in their children's education. This can involve providing opportunities for parents to participate in decision-making processes, offering cultural competency training for teachers and staff, and promoting regular communication and collaboration between home and school.
