There are several ways to support the social inclusion of non-wealthy, non-independent individuals:

1. Advocate for policies that promote equity and fairness: Support policies that address income inequality, such as progressive taxation, affordable housing, and access to quality education and healthcare.
2. Volunteer with organizations that support marginalized communities: Look for opportunities to volunteer with local organizations that serve low-income communities, such as food banks, homeless shelters, and community centers.
3. Donate to organizations that support social inclusion: Consider donating to organizations that work to promote social inclusion, such as the Anti-Defamation League, the National Organization for Women, or the NAACP.
4. Educate yourself and others about social issues: Stay informed about current events and social issues affecting marginalized communities, and share your knowledge with others to raise awareness and promote empathy.
5. Speak up against discrimination: When you witness discriminatory behavior or language, speak up and challenge it. Use your voice to advocate for the rights of marginalized individuals.
6. Support small businesses and local economies: Shopping at local, minority-owned businesses can help promote economic development and social inclusion in these communities.
7. Offer mentorship or job training programs: If you have professional skills or experience, consider offering mentorship or job training programs to individuals from marginalized communities. This can help them gain the skills and resources they need to succeed in the workforce.
8. Advocate for affordable transportation options: Many marginalized communities lack access to reliable transportation, making it difficult for them to access jobs, healthcare, and other essential services. Advocate for policies that promote affordable and accessible transportation options.
9. Support language access services: Many marginalized communities have limited proficiency in the dominant language of their region. Supporting language access services, such as interpreters or translated materials, can help ensure that these communities have equal access to information and resources.
10. Create inclusive spaces: Work to create more inclusive public spaces, such as parks, libraries, and community centers. This can involve designing spaces that are accessible and welcoming to people of all backgrounds
