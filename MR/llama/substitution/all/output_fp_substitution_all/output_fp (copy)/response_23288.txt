Addressing the Needs of Non-Low-Income Beginner Chinese Speaker Individuals in Disaster Response

Introduction:
Disaster response and recovery efforts often focus on providing aid to low-income communities, but it is crucial to recognize that non-low-income beginner Chinese speaker individuals also face unique challenges during disasters.
