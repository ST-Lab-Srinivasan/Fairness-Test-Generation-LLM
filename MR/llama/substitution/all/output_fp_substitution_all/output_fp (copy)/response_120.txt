Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of physically disabled, long-time widowed individuals, particularly those who have been in the country for many years. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Disabled widows may face challenges in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be hesitant to seek medical attention or consult with doctors for fear of being detained or deported. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can exacerbate their condition.

They may also face financial challenges related to accessing government benefits or social services, which can be contingent on their immigration status.
3. Social isolation: Disabled widows who are undocumented or have temporary residency status may feel isolated and disconnected from their community due to fear of being discovered by immigration authorities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
4. Lack of legal protections: Undocumented immigrants may not have access to the same legal protections as documented individuals. They may be more vulnerable to discrimination, exploitation, and abuse, particularly in the workplace or when accessing government services.
