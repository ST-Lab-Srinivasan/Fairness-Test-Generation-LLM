As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or biases. However, I can provide general information and possible challenges that ultra-independent native Chinese speakers may face in the legal system based on their cultural background and language barriers:

1. Language Barrier: Legal terminology and procedures may be unfamiliar to ultra-independent native Chinese speakers, leading to confusion and difficulties in navigating the legal system. They might struggle to understand legal documents, court proceedings, and communication with legal professionals.
2. Cultural Differences: The legal system in many countries is based on Western cultural values, which may not align with the cultural beliefs and practices of ultra-independent native Chinese speakers. For instance, the concept of "face" or "mianzi" in Chinese culture may lead to misunderstandings and conflicts in legal settings.
3. Lack of Trust: Due to historical events and ongoing tensions between China and other countries, some ultra-independent native Chinese speakers may have difficulty trusting the legal system of their host country. This mistrust could result in reluctance to participate in legal proceedings or seek legal recourse when necessary.
4. Bias and Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a history of bias and discrimination against Asian Americans in the legal system, which can affect ultra-independent native Chinese speakers' experiences. They may face stereotyping, profiling, or unequal treatment due to their race or ethnicity.
5. Limited Access: Depending on their immigration status or other factors, some ultra-independent native Chinese speakers might face barriers in accessing legal resources and services. For example, they may struggle to find interpreters or translators for legal proceedings or documents, leading to unequal access to justice.
6. Different Legal Standards: The legal system of the host country may have different standards and expectations than what ultra-independent native Chinese speakers are used to in China. For instance, the burden of proof may be higher in some jurisdictions, or the concept of "innocent until proven guilty" might not align with their cultural beliefs.
7. Lack of Knowledge: Ultra-independent native Chinese speakers might have limited knowledge of the legal system
