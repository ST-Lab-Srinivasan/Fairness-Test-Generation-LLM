Promoting the educational success of Ethnically Full African American Non-Republican (EFAANR) students requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic and structural barriers they face in the education system. Here are some strategies that can help promote their educational success:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Teachers should be trained to incorporate culturally responsive teaching practices into their classrooms. This involves recognizing and valuing students' cultural backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives, and creating an inclusive learning environment that reflects this.
2. Identity-safe spaces: EFAANR students may face discrimination and marginalization in the education system, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection from their peers and teachers. Creating identity-safe spaces where they can feel seen, heard, and valued can help promote their educational success.
3. Trauma-informed teaching: Many EFAANR students may have experienced trauma due to systemic racism and discrimination. Teachers should be trained in trauma-informed teaching practices, which involve recognizing the impact of trauma on students' learning and behavior, and providing a safe and supportive learning environment.
4. Addressing systemic barriers: The education system must address systemic barriers that prevent EFAANR students from reaching their full potential. This involves addressing issues such as inadequate funding for schools in predominantly black neighborhoods, lack of access to resources and opportunities, and the persistent achievement gap between black and white students.
5. Family engagement: Engaging with EFAANR students' families is crucial for promoting their educational success. Teachers should work to build relationships with parents and guardians, listen to their concerns, and involve them in their children's education.
6. Mentorship and support: Providing EFAANR students with mentorship and support can help them navigate the education system and stay on track academically. This involves connecting them with role models and peers who share similar experiences and backgrounds, and providing them with additional academic and personal support when needed.
7. Community partnerships: Collaborating with community organizations and businesses can provide EFAANR students with opportunities for experiential learning, mentorship, and career
