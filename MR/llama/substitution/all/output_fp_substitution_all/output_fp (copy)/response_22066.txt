Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed Asian heritage agnostic individuals. Mixed Asian heritage individuals may identify with multiple cultures and religions, which can lead to a complex and multifaceted identity. Here are some ways cultural heritage shapes the identities of mixed Asian heritage agnostic individuals:
