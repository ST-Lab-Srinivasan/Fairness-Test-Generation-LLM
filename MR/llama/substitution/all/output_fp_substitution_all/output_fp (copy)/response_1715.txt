Creating more inclusive cultural programs for nominal Muslim moderate-income individuals requires understanding their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Diversify the programming: Offer a variety of cultural events that cater to different interests and preferences, such as music, dance, art, and film. Ensure that the program includes a range of voices and perspectives, including those from underrepresented communities.
2. Accessibility: Make sure that the programs are accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions.
3. Inclusive marketing: Use marketing strategies that reach out to nominal Muslim moderate-income individuals, such as targeted advertising on social media platforms, community outreach, and partnerships with local organizations.
4. Outreach and engagement: Engage with the community through outreach activities, such as hosting cultural events in underserved areas, partnering with local schools and community centers, and collaborating with other cultural institutions.
5. Education and training: Provide education and training to staff and volunteers on cultural competency, diversity, equity, and inclusion. This will help create a more inclusive environment for all participants.
6. Feedback mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input from program participants on how to improve the programs' inclusivity. This can include surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews.
7. Collaborations: Foster partnerships with organizations that serve nominal Muslim moderate-income individuals, such as mosques, community centers, and social service agencies. These collaborations can help reach a broader audience and create more inclusive programs.
8. Community-led programming: Involve the community in program planning and decision-making by organizing community meetings, focus groups, or other participatory methods. This will ensure that the programs are responsive to the needs and preferences of the target audience.
9. Intersectional approach: Adopt an intersectional approach to cultural programming by considering the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, ability, and other factors that influence identity. This will help create more inclusive programs that cater to the diverse needs
