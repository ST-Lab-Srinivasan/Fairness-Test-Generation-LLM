3. Engage in policy changes: Advocate for policies that benefit child native English speakers, such as bilingual education programs, language support services, and cultural sensitivity training for teachers and other educators.

These events can help create a more inclusive environment for child native English speakers and encourage greater empathy towards their experiences.
