Supporting the economic empowerment of upper middle-income Native natural-born US citizen individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to capital: Many Native entrepreneurs lack access to capital and credit, which hinders their ability to start or grow their businesses. Programs like the Native American Business Development Center (NABDC) and the US Small Business Administration's (SBA) Microloan program can help provide funding and support.
2. Entrepreneurship training and education: Providing training and education on entrepreneurship and business management can help Native individuals develop the skills they need to succeed in the business world. Programs like the National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development (NCAIED) and the Native American Business Association (NABA) offer such programs.
3. Mentorship and networking: Connecting Native entrepreneurs with experienced mentors and networking opportunities can help them build valuable relationships and gain insights into the business world. Programs like the SBA's Small Business Mentorship Program and the National Indian Business Association (Niba) offer such opportunities.
4. Access to markets: Many Native entrepreneurs face challenges in accessing markets and customers, which can hinder their ability to grow their businesses. Programs like the SBA's Marketplace Lending program and the USDA's Rural Business Development Grants can help provide access to new markets and customers.
5. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Supporting the cultural preservation and revitalization of Native communities can help create a sense of identity and purpose, which can in turn support economic empowerment. Programs like the Native American Heritage Foundation (NAHF) and the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) offer grants and support for cultural preservation and revitalization initiatives.
6. Advocacy and policy change: Advocating for policies that support Native economic development, such as tax incentives, loan guarantees, and access to affordable healthcare, can help create a more favorable business environment. Organizations like the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) and the Native American Rights Fund (NARF) work on advocacy and policy
