Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Spanish speakers, advanced learners over the age of 90, and middle-aged individuals (ages 85+) requires careful planning and consideration. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and enjoyable for all participants:

1. Provide language support: Offer simultaneous interpretation or sign language interpretation during events to assist those who may not speak Spanish fluently. This can be done through hired interpreters or volunteers trained in interpretation.
2. Use visual aids: Utilize images, videos, and other visual elements to convey information and keep attendees engaged, especially for those with hearing or language barriers.
3. Offer adaptive technology: Make sure the event space is equipped with adaptive technology, such as closed captioning or audio descriptions, to assist participants who may have difficulty accessing certain information.
4. Flexible seating and mobility: Provide flexible seating arrangements and ensure that the event space is wheelchair-accessible to accommodate individuals with mobility issues.
5. Accessibility training for staff and volunteers: Offer accessibility training for event staff and volunteers to ensure they are aware of the needs of participants with disabilities and can provide appropriate support.
6. Inclusive programming: Design events that cater to diverse interests and abilities, such as cultural performances, art exhibitions, or workshops that focus on topics relevant to older adults (e.g., memory loss, cognitive stimulation).
7. Communication support: Provide clear and consistent communication with participants before, during, and after the event, using multiple channels (e.g., email, phone, social media) to ensure everyone is informed.
8. Age-friendly activities: Plan activities that are enjoyable and accessible for all ages, such as group games, puzzles, or crafts.
9. Volunteer support: Recruit volunteers who can provide additional support to participants, such as helping with navigation or providing one-on-one attention during events.
10. Collaboration with disability organizations: Partner with local organizations that advocate for people with disabilities to gain insight and expertise in creating inclusive community events.
