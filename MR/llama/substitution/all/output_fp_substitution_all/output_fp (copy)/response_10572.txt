Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting non-conservative and non-lower-class communities by providing them with access to resources, opportunities, and social capital that they may not have otherwise had. Here are some ways volunteerism can support these communities:

1. Access to resources: Volunteers can provide access to resources such as food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare that may be difficult for these communities to access on their own. For example, volunteers may help staff a food bank or organize a clothing drive for a local homeless shelter.
2. Education and skills-building: Volunteers can provide educational opportunities and skills-building workshops to members of these communities, helping them to acquire new skills and knowledge that can improve their lives.
