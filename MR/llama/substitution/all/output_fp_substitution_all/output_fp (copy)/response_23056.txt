Ensuring that the voices of native English speakers who have not been married for a long time are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create an inclusive environment: Foster an atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable sharing their opinions and experiences. Encourage active listening and empathy towards others.
2. Use diverse representation: Ensure that the decision-making group is representative of the diversity of voices in the community, including those who have not been married for a long time. This can be done by actively seeking out individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences.
3. Focus on underrepresented groups: Give special attention to the voices of native English speakers who have not been married for a long time. Make sure they are included in discussions and decision-making processes that affect their lives.
4. Use anonymous surveys or focus groups: Conducting anonymous surveys or focus groups can help individuals share their opinions without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be particularly useful for those who may feel uncomfortable speaking up in a group setting.
5. Encourage mentorship and sponsorship: Pair individuals from underrepresented groups with more senior or experienced colleagues who can provide guidance, support, and advocacy. This can help them build confidence and navigate decision-making processes more effectively.
6. Establish a system of checks and balances: Implement a system where diverse voices are represented at all levels of decision-making, from the initial planning stages to the final implementation. This can help ensure that a wide range of perspectives are taken into account and that no one group dominates the decision-making process.
7. Provide training and resources: Offer training and resources to help individuals develop their leadership and communication skills. This can help them feel more confident and empowered to participate in decision-making processes.
8. Encourage collaboration and cooperation: Foster a culture of collaboration and cooperation among diverse groups, encouraging them to work together towards common goals. This can help ensure that everyone's voice is heard and valued.
9. Use technology to facilitate communication: Utilize digital platforms and tools to enable remote participation in decision-making processes, making it easier for individuals who may face barriers to attendance
