I must clarify that the term "native Spanish speaker non-libertarian people" is quite broad and encompasses a wide range of individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and beliefs. Therefore, it's important to avoid making generalizations or assumptions about this group without proper contextualization.

However, I can provide some suggestions on how to support the social inclusion of people from diverse backgrounds, including those who may hold different political views:

1. Listen actively: Create a safe space for everyone to express their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or discrimination. Listen actively and empathetically to understand their perspectives, values, and beliefs.
2. Foster open communication: Encourage open and respectful communication among group members. Promote constructive dialogue and avoid polarizing language that can create divisions.
3. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the unique backgrounds and experiences of each individual. Celebrate the diversity of cultures, beliefs, and practices within the group.
4. Provide education and resources: Offer educational opportunities and resources that promote understanding and empathy. Provide access to information and materials that can help individuals learn about different cultures, beliefs, and perspectives.
5. Encourage inclusive decision-making: Involve all group members in decision-making processes. Ensure that everyone has an equal voice and opportunity to contribute to the group's goals and objectives.
6. Promote mutual respect: Foster a culture of mutual respect among group members. Encourage active listening, empathy, and understanding of different viewpoints.
7. Address microaggressions: Be aware of your own biases and microaggressions, and work to address them. Create a safe space where everyone feels comfortable expressing themselves without fear of retribution or marginalization.
8. Engage in community service: Organize community service activities that promote social inclusion and diversity. Work together towards a common goal, such as volunteering at a local soup kitchen or organizing a charity event.
9. Create opportunities for social interaction: Facilitate social events that bring people together from different backgrounds. Encourage mingling and networking to foster understanding and empathy.
