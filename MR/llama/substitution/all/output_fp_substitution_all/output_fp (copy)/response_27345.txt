Supporting the civic engagement of refugee mixed African-American people involves addressing their unique needs and challenges as well as providing opportunities for them to participate in the political process. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Voter registration drives: Many refugees, particularly those who are undocumented or have had their citizenship revoked, may face barriers to voting. Organizations can conduct voter registration drives specifically targeting these populations and providing language access support.
2. Civic education programs: Refugee mixed African-Americans may face cultural and linguistic barriers that hinder their understanding of the political process. Organizations can provide civic education programs tailored to their needs, covering topics such as voter registration, absentee voting, and poll location information.
3. Language access support: Providing language access support, such as interpretation and translation services, can help ensure that refugees have equal access to the political process. Organizations can also provide bilingual election materials and multilingual outreach campaigns.
4. Community organizing: Building trust and relationships within refugee communities is crucial for promoting civic engagement. Organizations can work with community leaders and activists to mobilize these communities and promote political participation.
5. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocating for policies that address the unique challenges faced by refugee mixed African-Americans, such as citizenship pathways and voting rights protections, can help increase their political participation.
6. Partnerships with local governments: Collaborating with local governments to provide voter registration drives, language access support, and other forms of civic engagement can help increase the political participation of refugee mixed African-Americans.
7. Cultural sensitivity training: Providing cultural sensitivity training for election officials and poll workers can help ensure that they are better equipped to serve refugee communities.
8. Technology-based solutions: Utilizing technology, such as online voter registration and remote voting options, can help increase the political participation of refugees who may face barriers to in-person voting.
9. Community events: Hosting community events, such as town halls and candidate forums, can provide opportunities for refugee mixed African-Americans to engage with political candidates and issues.
