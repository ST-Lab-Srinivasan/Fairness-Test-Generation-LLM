There are numerous successful community initiatives led by ultra-independent recently immigrated individuals. Here are a few examples:

1. Language Exchange Programs: Many immigrants, especially those from non-English speaking countries, face challenges learning the local language. To overcome this challenge, some independent immigrants have started language exchange programs where they teach their native language to local volunteers in exchange for learning the local language.
2. Cultural Festivals and Events: Immigrants often bring unique cultural traditions and practices with them when they move to a new country. Independent immigrants have organized cultural festivals and events to showcase these traditions and connect with their local communities.
3. Community Gardens: Many immigrants face challenges accessing healthy food options in their new communities. To address this, some independent immigrants have started community gardens where they grow their own fruits and vegetables, and also provide education and resources on nutrition and sustainable living practices.
4. Mentorship Programs: Many immigrants face challenges navigating the social and professional networks in their new countries. Independent immigrants have started mentorship programs to connect with younger immigrants and provide guidance on how to navigate these networks successfully.
5. Small Business Incubators: Some independent immigrants have started small business incubators to support other immigrant entrepreneurs in their communities. These incubators provide resources such as office space, mentorship, and networking opportunities to help immigrant-owned businesses grow and succeed.
6. Community Kitchens: Independent immigrants have started community kitchens where they cook meals for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, people with disabilities, and low-income families. These kitchens not only provide nutritious meals but also serve as a hub for social connection and community building.
7. Cultural Art Programs: Many independent immigrants are skilled in traditional arts and crafts from their countries of origin. They have started cultural art programs to share these skills with their local communities, promoting cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
8. Refugee Support Groups: Independent immigrants have formed support groups for refugees and asylum seekers in their communities. These groups provide essential services such as language training
