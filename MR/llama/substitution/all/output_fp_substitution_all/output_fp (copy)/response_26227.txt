The impact of military status on the lives of non-conservative individuals extends beyond those living above the poverty line. Here are some ways in which military status can affect the lives of non-conservative individuals:

1. Loss of privacy: Military personnel often have to undergo extensive background checks and surveillance, which can lead to a loss of privacy. They may also be subject to random drug testing and other forms of monitoring that can infringe on their right to privacy.
2. Limited civilian opportunities: The military often requires its members to adhere to strict rules and regulations, which can limit their ability to pursue civilian opportunities. For example, a soldier may not be able to take a job outside of the military because they are required to follow certain protocols or wear specific uniforms.

This can be particularly difficult for non-conservative individuals who may have different priorities than the military and may struggle to balance work and family life.
