1. Use visual aids and illustrations: Beginner Spanish speakers may benefit from using visual aids and illustrations to help them understand medical concepts and procedures. This could include pictures, diagrams, or videos that demonstrate medical terminology and procedures.

Providing cultural sensitivity training for staff can help ensure that they are better equipped to communicate effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds.
