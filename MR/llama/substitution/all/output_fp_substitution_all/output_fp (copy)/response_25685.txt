Lower-income passport holders may face several challenges when accessing healthcare services, including:

1. Limited financial resources: Lower-income individuals may struggle to afford medical costs, including copays, deductibles, and coinsurance. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate health problems and create more expensive health issues down the line.
2. Lack of health insurance: Many lower-income individuals may not have access to health insurance, either due to lack of affordability or lack of availability in their area. This can make it difficult to access necessary medical care, especially for chronic conditions or emergency situations.
3. Language barriers: Lower-income individuals who are non-native English speakers may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
4. Limited access to specialized care: Lower-income individuals may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, or neurologists, due to geographic barriers or lack of availability in their area.
5. Discrimination and bias: Lower-income individuals may face discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, which can lead to delayed or withheld care.
6. Limited transportation options: Lower-income individuals may have limited access to transportation, which can make it difficult to get to medical appointments or pick up prescriptions.
7. Limited knowledge of the healthcare system: Lower-income individuals may have limited knowledge of the healthcare system and how to navigate it, which can lead to difficulties in accessing care.
8. Fear of deportation: Undocumented immigrants may face additional challenges when seeking medical care, including fear of deportation or detention by immigration authorities.
9. Limited cultural competency: Healthcare providers may have limited cultural competency when caring for lower-income individuals from diverse backgrounds, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
10. Limited access to mental health services: Lower-income individuals may have limited access to mental health services, including therapy and psychiatric care, due to geographic barriers or lack of availability in their area.
