It is important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Here are some potential impacts of immigration status on the lives of non-wealthy, liberal individuals:

1. Uncertainty and insecurity: Individuals with uncertain or unstable immigration status may experience anxiety and stress due to the lack of control over their lives. They may be constantly worried about their immigration status, including potential deportation or separation from their families.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Many non-wealthy individuals may struggle to access healthcare due to financial constraints. If they are undocumented, they may be reluctant to seek medical attention for fear of being reported to immigration authorities. Even if they have legal status, they may face language barriers or cultural differences that can hinder their ability to navigate the healthcare system.
3. Limited access to education: Non-wealthy individuals may face financial barriers that prevent them from pursuing higher education. Undocumented individuals may be unable to access financial aid or scholarships, while those with temporary status may worry about their ability to remain in the country long enough to complete their studies.
4. Limited job opportunities: Non-wealthy individuals may struggle to find employment due to a lack of access to job training programs, networking opportunities, or other resources that can help them advance in their careers. They may also face discrimination or bias based on their immigration status.
5. Social isolation: Individuals with uncertain immigration status may experience social isolation due to fear of being rejected or discriminated against by their communities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
6. Limited access to legal services: Non-wealthy individuals may struggle to afford legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the complex immigration system. They may also face language barriers or cultural differences that can hinder their ability to communicate with legal professionals.
7. Lack of political representation: Undocumented individuals may feel marginalized and disconnected from the political process due to their lack of formal citizenship. This can lead to a sense of powerlessness and disenfranchisement, which can further exacerbate feelings of anxiety and stress.
