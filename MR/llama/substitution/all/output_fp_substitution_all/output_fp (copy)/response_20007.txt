Supporting moderate independent Native English speaker (NEST) communities can be a challenging but rewarding task. Here are some effective strategies to help you achieve your goals:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that all NESTs feel welcome and included in the community. Encourage them to participate in activities and events, and offer support when needed.
2. Foster communication and collaboration: Encourage NESTs to communicate with each other and work together on projects or initiatives. This can help build relationships and foster a sense of community.
3. Provide opportunities for language development: Offer language classes, conversation groups, or other activities that allow NESTs to practice their English skills and improve their proficiency.
4. Celebrate cultural diversity: Encourage NESTs to share their cultures and traditions with the community. This can help build bridges between different cultures and foster a sense of mutual respect.
5. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair experienced NESTs with newer members of the community, providing them with guidance and support as they navigate their new surroundings.
6. Provide resources and support: Offer access to resources such as language learning materials, cultural events, and job search support. This can help NESTs feel more connected to the community and better equipped to navigate their new environment.
7. Foster a sense of belonging: Encourage NESTs to get involved in local events and initiatives, and help them find ways to contribute to their communities. This can help them feel more connected to their new homes and build a sense of belonging.
8. Be mindful of cultural differences: Be sensitive to the cultural norms and practices of NESTs, and avoid making assumptions or imposing your own culture on them. Instead, learn about their cultures and traditions, and find ways to respectfully integrate them into the community.
9. Encourage networking: Pair NESTs with local professionals, entrepreneurs, and other influential individuals in the community. This can help them build connections and opportunities for personal and professional growth.
10. Offer social activities: Organize events and activities that bring NESTs together, such as potluck dinners, movie nights, or outdoor excursions.
