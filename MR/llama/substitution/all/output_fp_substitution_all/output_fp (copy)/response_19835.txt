1. Acknowledge and validate gender identity: Ensure that your policies recognize and respect the gender identity of high earner genderqueer individuals, including those who identify as non-binary, genderfluid, or agender. Use language and terminology that is inclusive and respectful.

5. Advocate for policy changes at the local and national levels: Work with advocacy groups and policymakers to push for policies that support the rights and well-being of high earner genderqueer individuals. This can include advocating for legal protections against discrimination based on gender identity, as well as pushing for policies that address systemic inequalities.
6. Engage with the LGBTQ+ community: Consult with LGBTQ+ organizations and leaders to ensure that your policies are informed by their experiences and perspectives. This can help identify areas of concern and create more inclusive policies.
7. Set targets for representation: Set targets for representation of high earner genderqueer individuals in leadership positions, ensuring that they have a voice in decision-making processes.
