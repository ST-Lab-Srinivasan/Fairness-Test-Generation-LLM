To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner Chinese speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Conduct surveys or questionnaires: Create a survey or questionnaire to gather data on the challenges and difficulties faced by beginner Chinese learners. You can distribute it through online platforms, language learning communities, or in-person classes.
2. Analyze language learning apps data: Many language learning apps, such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone, collect data on users' progress, errors, and behavior. You can analyze this data to identify common mistakes or areas where learners struggle the most.
3. Use sentiment analysis: Analyze online reviews, comments, or social media posts from beginner Chinese learners to gauge their sentiment towards language learning resources, tutors, or classes. This can help you identify which aspects of language learning are most challenging for beginners.
4. Create a user journey map: Map out the entire journey of a beginner Chinese learner, from initial interest to eventual fluency. Identify key touchpoints, such as the first time using a language learning app or attending a class, and analyze the data to understand which factors influence learners' progress.
5. Conduct interviews: Interview beginner Chinese learners to gather qualitative data on their experiences, challenges, and motivations. This can help you gain insights into the unique obstacles faced by each individual learner.
6. Analyze learning data: Use machine learning algorithms or statistical models to analyze learners' language use patterns, such as grammar mistakes, vocabulary usage, or sentence structure. Identify common errors and areas where learners struggle the most.
7. Monitor progress over time: Track beginner Chinese learners' progress over a significant period, such as several months or a year. Analyze how their language skills evolve and identify any consistent patterns or challenges.
8. Evaluate learner behavior: Use data to understand how beginner Chinese learners interact with language learning resources, such as the amount of time spent on each resource, the types of activities they engage in, or the frequency of use. Identify which behaviors are most predictive of success.
9. Determine the impact of external factors: Analyze the impact of external factors, such as cultural background, motivation level
