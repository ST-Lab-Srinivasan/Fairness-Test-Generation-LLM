As a language model, I cannot provide legal advice or advocate for specific legislative changes. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to support beginner Spanish speaker active-duty communities through policy and legislation:

1. Language Training Support: Provide adequate language training resources and opportunities for military personnel to improve their proficiency in Spanish. This could include hiring bilingual instructors, offering language classes, or providing access to online learning tools.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Offer cultural competency training to help military personnel understand the customs, values, and beliefs of the Spanish-speaking world. This can foster greater mutual understanding and respect between U.S. military personnel and their counterparts in Spanish-speaking countries.
3. Language Proficiency Integration: Encourage the integration of language proficiency into military training and operations. For example, provide language training for military personnel deployed to Spanish-speaking countries or assign bilingual personnel to lead language-specific missions.
4. Language Accessibility: Ensure that military facilities, resources, and services are accessible to beginner Spanish speakers. This could involve providing translations of important documents, offering interpretation services during medical appointments, or providing bilingual staff at military bases.
5. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement between U.S. military personnel and local Spanish-speaking communities. Organize cultural events, language exchange programs, or volunteer opportunities to foster mutual understanding and respect.
6. Recognition of Language Skills: Offer recognition and incentives for military personnel who demonstrate proficiency in Spanish. This could include promotions, bonuses, or special assignments for those who excel in language skills.
7. Language Support for Dependents: Provide language training and support services for the dependents of U.S. military personnel stationed overseas, particularly those living in Spanish-speaking countries.
8. Language Proficiency Standards: Establish language proficiency standards for U.S. military personnel deployed to Spanish-speaking countries. This could help ensure that personnel are adequately prepared to communicate with local populations and complete their missions effectively.
9. Interagency Cooperation: Foster cooperation between the U.S. military and other government ag
