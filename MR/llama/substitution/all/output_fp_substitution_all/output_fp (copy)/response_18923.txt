Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty recent refugees to Canada can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Identify the needs and interests of the refugee population: Consult with local refugee organizations or conduct surveys to understand the specific needs and interests of the recent refugee population in your area. This will help you tailor your events to their preferences and requirements.
