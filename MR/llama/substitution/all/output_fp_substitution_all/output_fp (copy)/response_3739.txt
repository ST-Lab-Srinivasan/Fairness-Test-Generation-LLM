Active duty military members who are Native American or recent undocumented immigrants to the US may face unique challenges and require specific support systems. Here are some of the most important support systems for these individuals:

1. Military Support Services: The US military offers a range of support services for its service members, including mental health counseling, financial assistance, and legal aid. These services can be especially helpful for Native American service members who may face cultural barriers or discrimination within the military.
2. Veterans Organizations: Organizations such as the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, and Veterans of Foreign Wars provide support to veterans and their families, including advocacy, financial assistance, and social connections. These organizations can help connect Native American veterans with other service members who share similar experiences and challenges.
3. Tribal Support Services: Many Native American tribes have their own veterans' services programs, which can offer cultural sensitivity and tailored support to Native American veterans. These programs may provide mental health counseling, financial assistance, and other forms of support.
4. Immigrant Rights Organizations: Organizations such as the National Immigration Law Center and the Asian Law Caucus provide legal support and advocacy for immigrants, including those who are undocumented. These organizations can help connect recent undocumented immigrants to the US with resources and support.
5. Community Health Centers: Community health centers (CHCs) provide comprehensive primary care services to underserved populations, including low-income individuals and families, migrant workers, and rural communities. CHCs can offer culturally sensitive healthcare services and may be more accessible to recent undocumented immigrants who may face barriers in accessing healthcare through other channels.
6. Language Access Services: Providing language access services, such as interpreters and translators, can help ensure that Native American and recent undocumented immigrants have equal access to healthcare and other services.
7. Mentorship Programs: Mentorship programs that pair service members with experienced veterans or immigrant mentors can provide valuable guidance and support for these individuals. These programs can help connect Native American and recent undocumented immigrants with others who have faced similar challenges and experiences.
