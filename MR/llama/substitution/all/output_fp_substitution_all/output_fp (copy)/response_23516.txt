As a French language model, I can provide some insights on the challenges faced by beginner French speakers aged 65 or older (and above 85 specifically) in the healthcare system. However, please note that these are generalizations and may not apply to every individual.

1. Decreased cognitive abilities: As people age, their cognitive abilities, including memory, attention, and processing speed, can decline. This can make it more difficult for older adults to learn a new language, especially one as complex as French.
2. Limited mobility or dexterity: Older adults may experience physical limitations that can make it harder to practice speaking, writing, or using technology related to learning French.
3. Hearing or vision loss: Many older adults experience age-related hearing or vision loss, which can affect their ability to comprehend spoken or written French.
4. Prioritizing other life tasks: Older adults may have more pressing concerns in their daily lives, such as managing chronic health issues, caring for loved ones, or dealing with financial and legal matters. As a result, they may not prioritize learning a new language.
5. Limited access to resources: Some older adults may not have access to reliable transportation, internet, or educational resources that can help them learn French.
6. Lack of motivation: Older adults may feel less motivated to learn a new language due to various reasons such as decreased mobility, reduced social interactions, or simply feeling less inclined to challenge themselves.
7. Limited opportunities for interaction: Older adults may have limited opportunities to interact with native French speakers, which can hinder their ability to practice speaking and listening in real-life situations.
8. Fear of making mistakes: Many older adults may be hesitant to speak French due to fear of making mistakes or feeling embarrassed about their language skills.
9. Limited attention span: Older adults may have a shorter attention span, which can make it harder for them to focus and retain new information.
10. Difficulty with cultural references: Older adults may find it challenging to understand cultural references or colloquial expressions in French, as their cultural background and experiences may be different from those of native speakers.
