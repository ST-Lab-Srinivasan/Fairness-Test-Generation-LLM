The impact of marital status on the lives of non-liberal individuals who have been married multiple times can be significant, particularly if they live in societies with traditional gender roles and expectations. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social Stigma: Non-liberal societies often place a high value on marital stability and the idea of "settling down" with one partner for life. Individuals who have been married multiple times may face social stigma, particularly if they are women. They may be seen as unstable, promiscuous, or lacking in commitment.
2. Limited Economic Opportunities: In many non-liberal societies, women's economic opportunities are limited by their marital status. Women who have been married multiple times may face discrimination in the workplace, and may be seen as less desirable job candidates due to their marital history.
3. Reduced Legal Rights: Non-liberal legal systems often provide fewer rights and protections for women than liberal systems. Women who have been married multiple times may face challenges in obtaining a divorce, particularly if their husband objects or if they lack financial resources. They may also face difficulties in obtaining custody of their children or property division.
4. Increased Vulnerability to Domestic Violence: Non-liberal societies often have higher rates of domestic violence against women. Women who have been married multiple times may be more vulnerable to abuse due to their marital history, particularly if they lack financial independence or social support.
5. Emotional and Psychological Impacts: The repeated experience of divorce and remarriage can take an emotional and psychological toll on individuals. They may struggle with feelings of failure, shame, or guilt, particularly if they are stigmatized by society. They may also experience anxiety or depression related to the instability of their marital status.
6. Difficulty Forming New Relationships: Individuals who have been married multiple times may find it challenging to form new relationships due to their marital history. They may be seen as unsuitable partners by potential romantic interests, or they may struggle to trust others after experiencing failed marriages.
7. Limited Access to Education and Training
