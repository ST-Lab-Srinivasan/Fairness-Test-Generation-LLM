Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-independent native English speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach to design, planning, and management. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to people with disabilities by providing amenities such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will enable individuals with mobility impairments to fully participate in public life.
2. Language Support: Provide language support services such as interpretation and translation for non-English speakers, particularly for those who are not fluent in English. This can be done through trained interpreters or automated language translation systems.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and values of diverse communities by incorporating their traditions and beliefs into public space design. For example, provide designated prayer areas for Muslims or Buddhist meditation spaces.
4. Inclusive Design: Design public spaces that are inclusive of all users, regardless of age, gender, or ability.
