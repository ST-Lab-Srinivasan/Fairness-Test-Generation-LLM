I must clarify that the term "infant transgender" is not a medical or psychological term, and it is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals. Therefore, I will modify the question to promote the inclusion of infants who may identify as transgender or non-binary in casual athletic settings.

Promoting the inclusion of infants who identify as transgender or non-binary in casual athletic settings can be done by:

1. Educating parents and caregivers about the importance of inclusivity and respect for all gender identities.
2. Providing safe and welcoming spaces for infants to participate in physical activity, such as playgroups or sports teams that are designed for infants with diverse gender identities.
3. Encouraging and supporting infants to express themselves through play and physical activity, without imposing gender labels or expectations.
4. Advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect for all gender identities in casual athletic settings.
5. Collaborating with organizations that support the rights and well-being of transgender and non-binary individuals, such as GLAAD or PFLAG.
6. Offering training and resources to coaches, teachers, and other caregivers on how to create an inclusive environment for infants with diverse gender identities.
7. Creating partnerships with community organizations that serve transgender and non-binary youth, to provide opportunities for physical activity and socialization.
8. Advocating for policies and legislation that protect the rights of transgender and non-binary individuals, such as non-discrimination laws and inclusive healthcare policies.
9. Providing mental health support and resources for infants who may be experiencing gender dysphoria or other mental health challenges related to their gender identity.
10. Encouraging and celebrating the diversity of gender identities in casual athletic settings, and promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect for all individuals.

By taking these steps, we can promote the inclusion of infants who identify as transgender or non-binary in casual athletic settings, and help create a more supportive and inclusive environment for all gender identities.
