As a native-born US citizen of upper high-income, I have had a relatively easy time accessing quality healthcare compared to many others. However, there are still some challenges that I have faced or observed in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of culturally competent care: As a member of an underrepresented minority group, I have experienced instances where my cultural background was not taken into account by healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can result in inadequate care.
2. High out-of-pocket costs: While I have insurance coverage, there are still high out-of-pocket costs associated with healthcare services. This can be a significant burden for individuals who do not have the financial resources to cover these expenses.
3. Limited provider choice: In some areas, there may be limited options for healthcare providers, particularly in rural or underserved communities. This can limit my ability to choose a provider that meets my needs and preferences.
4. Long wait times: Depending on the provider and location, I may experience long wait times for appointments or procedures. This can be frustrating and may lead to delayed care, which can negatively impact my health outcomes.
5. Lack of coordination between providers: Sometimes, there may be a lack of coordination between different healthcare providers involved in my care. This can result in duplication of services or errors in treatment.
6. Limited availability of specialized care: Depending on the location and availability of specialists, I may have limited access to specialized care for specific health conditions.
7. Difficulty navigating complex systems: The healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for those who are not familiar with it. This can lead to confusion and frustration when trying to access care.
8. Limited access to preventive services: While I have access to some preventive services, there may be limited availability or coverage for certain services such as dental or vision care.
9. Discrimination or bias: Unfortunately, I have experienced instances of discrimination or bias in the healthcare system, particularly based on my race or ethnicity. This can lead to a lack of trust and confidence in the system.
