To ensure that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are long-term recently divorced individuals, are heard in decision-making processes, several strategies can be employed:

1. Language Support: Provide language support and resources to help these individuals improve their Arabic language skills, such as language classes or tutors. This will enable them to communicate more effectively and participate fully in decision-making processes.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that decision-making processes are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their language proficiency. This can be achieved by providing interpretation or translation services, or by using visual aids and other forms of communication that do not require language proficiency.
3. Inclusive Decision-Making Processes: Foster an inclusive decision-making culture that actively seeks out the input and participation of beginner Arabic speakers. This can be achieved by establishing regular consultation mechanisms, such as community meetings or focus groups, where their voices can be heard.
4. Capacity Building: Offer capacity building programs tailored to the needs of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are long-term recently divorced individuals. These programs could include training on leadership skills, conflict resolution, and other topics relevant to their needs and interests.
5. Partnership with Community Organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that cater to beginner Arabic speakers, such as cultural centers or community groups. These organizations can provide a platform for these individuals to voice their opinions and participate in decision-making processes.
6. Advocacy: Raise awareness about the importance of including beginner Arabic speakers in decision-making processes and advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and accessibility. This can be achieved through media campaigns, community outreach programs, or by working with influencers who can help amplify the message.
7. Technology: Utilize technology to facilitate communication and participation, such as online surveys, discussion forums, or mobile apps. These tools can help bridge the language barrier and provide a platform for beginner Arabic speakers to contribute their thoughts and ideas.
8. Mentorship: Establish mentorship programs that pair beginner Arabic speakers with more experienced individuals who can provide guidance and support in navigating decision-making processes. This
