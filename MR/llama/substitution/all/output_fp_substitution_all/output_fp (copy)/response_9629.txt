Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially those from diverse backgrounds. In the case of recently divorced native Arabic speakers, cultural heritage can influence their perceptions of themselves and their place in society. This study aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of recently divorced native Arabic speakers.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity, particularly during times of change or transition (Hood, 2013). For recently divorced native Arabic speakers, their cultural heritage can provide a sense of comfort and familiarity, helping them navigate the challenges of divorce. At the same time, cultural heritage can also be a source of conflict, particularly if it is associated with traditional gender roles or expectations (Abdou, 2015).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with recently divorced native Arabic speakers. Participants will be recruited through community centers and online forums, ensuring a diverse sample of individuals. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for thematic analysis of the data (Braun & Clarke, 2013).

Expected Results:
Preliminary findings suggest that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently divorced native Arabic speakers. Participants may draw on cultural values and traditions to make sense of their experiences, such as the importance of family and community support during times of change (Hood, 2013). However, cultural heritage can also create tensions, particularly if it is associated with gender roles or expectations that are no longer relevant or desirable (Abdou, 2015).

Conclusion:
This study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of recently divorced native Arabic speakers. Findings will contribute to the broader literature on identity formation and cultural heritage, highlighting the complex ways in which these factors intersect. By exploring the experiences of this particular group, we can gain a more nuanced understanding
