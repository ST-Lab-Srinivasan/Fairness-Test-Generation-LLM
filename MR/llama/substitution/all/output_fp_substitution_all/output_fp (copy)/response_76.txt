Creating more inclusive social policies for blue-collar ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the role of caregiving: Blue-collar workers, particularly women, often take on caregiving responsibilities, which can limit their ability to pursue education and career opportunities. Policies should recognize the value of caregiving work and provide support for caregivers, such as flexible work arrangements or financial assistance.
2. Provide access to education and training: Many blue-collar workers lack access to education and training opportunities that can help them acquire new skills and advance in their careers. Governments and employers should invest in vocational training programs, apprenticeships, and adult education initiatives to help blue-collar workers upskill and reskill.
3. Address wage inequality: Blue-collar workers are often paid lower wages than their white-collar counterparts, even when they have similar levels of education and experience. Policies should aim to address wage inequality by promoting fair compensation practices and providing benefits that reflect the value of blue-collar work.
4. Promote job security: Blue-collar workers are often exposed to job insecurity due to factors such as outsourcing, automation, and economic downturns. Policies should prioritize job security by promoting stable employment arrangements, providing support for entrepreneurship and small business development, and investing in industries that offer stable employment opportunities.
5. Advocate for affordable housing: Many blue-collar workers struggle to afford decent housing due to stagnant wages and rising housing costs. Policies should prioritize affordable housing options, such as rent control, subsidized housing, and homeownership programs, to help blue-collar workers access safe and secure housing.
6. Strengthen social safety nets: Blue-collar workers are often vulnerable to economic shocks due to factors such as job loss or illness. Policies should strengthen social safety nets by providing unemployment insurance, disability benefits, and other forms of financial support to help blue-collar workers weather economic downturns.
