Advocating for the rights of recent refugees in the US, particularly those who have served in the military, can be a challenging task. However, there have been several successful examples of advocacy efforts that have improved the lives of these individuals. Here are some examples:

1. The Refugee Act of 1980: This federal law was passed to provide assistance and protection to refugees coming to the US.

2. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA): This federal law provides protections for active-duty military members who are called to serve in the military. The SCRA helps ensure that service members can continue to receive benefits, such as housing and employment protections, while they are serving in the military.
3. The Equal Access to Housing in Suburban Areas (EAHSA) Act: This federal law was passed to provide affordable housing options for low-income families, including refugees, in suburban areas. The law helped to address a lack of affordable housing options for these individuals and families.
4. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Resettlement Program: This program provides resettlement opportunities for refugees who are unable to return to their home countries due to conflict, persecution, or other factors.
