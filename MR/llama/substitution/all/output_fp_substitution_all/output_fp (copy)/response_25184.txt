Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those from ethnically full African-American communities, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting equity and inclusion. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Build relationships and trust: Establishing trust and rapport with these individuals is key to getting them involved in decision-making processes. This can be done by spending time with them, listening to their concerns, and showing appreciation for their perspectives.
2. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops to help these individuals improve their English proficiency. This will not only help them communicate more effectively but also give them the confidence they need to participate in decision-making processes.
3. Use interpreters and translators: When conducting meetings or decision-making sessions, use interpreters and translators to ensure that these individuals can fully participate. This can be especially helpful for those who may not speak English fluently.
4. Involve them in the decision-making process from the start: Make sure that these individuals are included in the initial planning stages of any decision-making processes. This will give them a voice and ensure that their perspectives are taken into account from the beginning.

7. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion within any decision-making process by actively seeking out and valuing diverse perspectives. This can be done by setting clear goals and expectations for inclusivity, providing training on cultural competence, and holding individuals accountable for promoting equity.
