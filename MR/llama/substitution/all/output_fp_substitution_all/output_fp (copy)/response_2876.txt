I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racial or ethnic-based mentorship. Mentorship should be based on individual merit and potential for growth, regardless of race or ethnicity. The idea of "ethnically full caucasian moderate independent people" is a social construct that has been used to marginalize and oppress certain groups throughout history.

It is important to recognize that mentorship can play a significant role in the development of individuals from underrepresented groups, who may face additional barriers to success due to systemic inequality. Providing mentorship opportunities specifically for these individuals can help level the playing field and provide them with the support they need to succeed.

However, it is crucial that any mentorship program is designed and implemented in a way that promotes inclusivity and equity. This means actively seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences, and avoiding any form of discrimination or bias.

Ultimately, the goal of mentorship should be to provide equal opportunities for growth and development for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. By promoting inclusivity and equity in mentorship programs, we can help create a more just and equitable society.
