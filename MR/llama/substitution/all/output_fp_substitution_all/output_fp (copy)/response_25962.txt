Addressing the specific needs of mixed African American newly divorced individuals in a bachelor's graduate program requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Recognize the unique experiences and challenges faced by mixed African Americans: Mixed African Americans often experience discrimination, microaggressions, and marginalization within their own communities, let alone in mainstream society. As a program, acknowledge these challenges and work to create an inclusive environment where all students feel valued and supported.
2. Provide cultural competence training: Offer training on cultural competence and diversity awareness to help faculty and staff understand the specific needs of mixed African American students. This can include topics such as microaggressions, cultural humility, and allyship.
3. Address intersectionality: Recognize that mixed African Americans may face unique challenges based on their intersecting identities (e.g., race, gender, sexuality). Ensure that your program addresses these intersections and provides support tailored to each student's individual needs.
4. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for mixed African American students to connect with one another and form a support network. This can be achieved through social events, study groups, or mentorship programs.
5. Provide academic support: Offer academic support services tailored to the needs of mixed African American students. This may include tutoring, academic advising, or coursework that addresses their specific interests and concerns.
6. Engage with the broader community: Encourage your program to engage with the broader community, including organizations that serve mixed African American populations. This can help provide real-world context for coursework and foster partnerships that benefit both the program and the community.
7. Leverage technology: Utilize technology to support mixed African American students, such as online resources, virtual events, or social media groups. These tools can help bridge geographic and logistical gaps, making it easier for students to connect with one another and access resources.
8. Monitor progress and make adjustments: Regularly assess the specific needs of mixed African American students in your program and make adjustments as needed. This may involve soliciting feedback from students, faculty, and staff or conducting research on best practices for supporting this population
