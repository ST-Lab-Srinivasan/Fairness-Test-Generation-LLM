I must clarify that advocating for the rights of any particular group, including mentally able-bodied individuals, is important. However, it is equally important to recognize that systemic inequality and discrimination can affect various marginalized groups, including those from low-income backgrounds.

1. Listen and amplify marginalized voices: Create spaces where marginalized communities can share their experiences and perspectives. Use your platform to amplify their voices, rather than speaking over them or for them. This helps build trust and credibility within these communities.

3. Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity: Support policies and practices that actively address systemic inequality.
