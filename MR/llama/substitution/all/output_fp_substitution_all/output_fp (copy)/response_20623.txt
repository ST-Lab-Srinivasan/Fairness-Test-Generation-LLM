Creating more inclusive cultural programs for casual Buddhists living just above the poverty line requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that your programs are accessible to people of all backgrounds and income levels. Offer scholarships, sliding scale fees, or free events to make them more affordable for those living on a tight budget.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural context and values of the communities you are serving. Avoid imposing external cultural practices that may be alienating or unfamiliar to your participants.
