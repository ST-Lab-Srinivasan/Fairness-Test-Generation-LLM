As a language model, I cannot take a political stance or advocate for specific legislative changes. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to support and include long-time civilian communities in the military and defense sector:

1. Language support: Provide language training and resources for English speakers who may not be fluent in the local language(s) spoken in the countries where they are serving. This could include language classes, interpreters, and translation services.
2. Cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training to help long-time civilian community members understand and respect local customs and traditions. This could include workshops, seminars, and interactive activities that promote cross-cultural understanding.
3. Inclusive hiring practices: Ensure that hiring processes are fair and inclusive, and that long-time civilian community members have equal opportunities for employment within the military and defense sector. This could include targeted recruitment efforts and mentorship programs to support career advancement.
4. Access to education and training: Provide access to educational and training opportunities for long-time civilian community members, such as language classes, vocational training, and certification programs. This could help them acquire new skills and knowledge that can benefit their careers and personal lives.
5. Community outreach and engagement: Establish regular community outreach and engagement programs to connect with long-time civilian communities and address any concerns or issues they may have. This could include town hall meetings, public forums, and social events that promote dialogue and collaboration.
6. Affordable housing options: Provide affordable housing options for long-time civilian community members who may be struggling to find affordable housing in the areas where they are serving. This could include subsidized rentals or homeownership programs.
7. Healthcare support: Ensure that long-time civilian community members have access to quality healthcare services, including mental health support and wellness programs. This could include on-base medical facilities, off-base clinics, and telemedicine services.
8. Community infrastructure investment: Invest in community infrastructure that supports the needs of long-time civilian communities, such as parks, recreational facilities, and community centers.
