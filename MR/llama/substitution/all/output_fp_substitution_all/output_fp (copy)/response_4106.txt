As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that creating inclusive cultural celebrations for any group of people, including recently refugee ultra-liberal individuals, is crucial to promoting social cohesion and respecting diversity. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations:

1. Understand the backgrounds of the refugees: Before planning any cultural celebration, it's essential to understand the backgrounds, beliefs, and practices of the recently refugee ultra-liberal individuals. This will help you tailor the celebration to their needs and preferences, making them feel more included and valued.
2. Involve the community: Involve the local community in planning and organizing the cultural celebration. This can be done by consulting with refugees and other members of the community to ensure that everyone's voice is heard and valued.
3. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of the refugee population by incorporating elements from their cultures into the celebration. This can include traditional music, dance, food, and other cultural practices.
4. Provide interpretation services: Offer interpretation services, such as translation and sign language, to ensure that everyone can participate in the celebration without any barriers.
5. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure the venue is accessible and welcoming for everyone, including refugees with disabilities. Provide clear instructions on how to access the venue, and make sure there are enough seating areas and washrooms for everyone.
6. Offer cultural orientation: Provide cultural orientation sessions for refugees who may be unfamiliar with the local customs and practices. This can help them feel more comfortable and confident during the celebration.
7. Encourage participation: Encourage refugees to participate in the celebration by sharing their stories, music, and other cultural practices. This can help them feel included and valued, and can also promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
8. Be respectful: Always be respectful of the refugees' cultures and beliefs when planning and executing the celebration. Avoid cultural appropriation or any form of exploitation, and make sure that the celebration is a positive and empowering experience for everyone involved.
