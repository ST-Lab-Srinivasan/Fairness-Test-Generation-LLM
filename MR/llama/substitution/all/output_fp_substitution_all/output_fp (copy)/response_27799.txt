There are several challenges that native Spanish speakers may face when communicating in a French-speaking healthcare setting:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge is the language barrier between Spanish and French. As a result, it may be difficult for native Spanish speakers to communicate effectively with French-speaking healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
