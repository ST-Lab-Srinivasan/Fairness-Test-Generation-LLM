Supporting the educational aspirations of Native English Speaker Lost Spouses (NESLS) can be a challenging but rewarding endeavor. Here are some ways you can help:

1. Encourage and motivate: NESLS often face unique challenges in their education journey due to cultural differences, language barriers, and other factors. As a supporter, you can help them overcome these obstacles by providing encouragement and motivation. Celebrate their successes, no matter how small, and offer words of encouragement when they feel discouraged.
2. Provide resources: Offer to help NESLS access educational resources such as language classes, cultural orientation programs, or tutoring services. You can also provide information on scholarships, grants, and other financial aid that may be available to them.
3. Create a supportive environment: Encourage NESLS to join study groups or clubs where they can interact with other English speakers in a supportive environment. This can help them build confidence and improve their language skills.
4. Offer mentorship: Pair NESLS with a mentor who is fluent in English and familiar with the local education system. The mentor can provide guidance, support, and encouragement to help NESLS navigate the educational system.
5. Advocate for inclusive policies: Work with educational institutions and government agencies to develop policies that promote inclusivity and support for NESLS. This can include language support services, cultural sensitivity training for educators, and flexible academic programs that cater to their needs.
6. Provide childcare and other practical support: Many NESLS face challenges related to childcare and other practical issues while pursuing their education. Offer to provide or connect them with resources such as affordable childcare, transportation, and meal programs.
7. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage NESLS to engage in cultural exchange activities and events that promote mutual understanding and respect between different cultures. This can help them build connections and feel more at home in their new environment.
8. Offer language classes: If you are not fluent in the local language, consider offering language classes specifically tailored to NESLS. This can help them improve their language skills and communicate more effectively with others.
