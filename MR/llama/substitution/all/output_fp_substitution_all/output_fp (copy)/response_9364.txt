Ensuring that the healthcare needs of all citizens, regardless of their socio-economic status, are met is a critical aspect of any healthcare system. Here are some strategies that can be employed to ensure that the healthcare needs of natural-born Indian citizens, including those above the poverty line, are met:

1. Universal Healthcoverage: Implementing universal health coverage (UHC) can help ensure that everyone has access to essential health services without facing financial hardship. UHC aims to provide comprehensive coverage for all citizens, regardless of their income or social status.
2. Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between public and private healthcare providers can help expand the availability of healthcare services, especially in rural areas where access to quality healthcare may be limited. Private providers can supplement public healthcare facilities, offering specialized care and increasing accessibility.
3. Telemedicine and Mobile Health Services: Leveraging technology can bridge the gap between urban and rural areas, providing remote consultations and telemedicine services. Mobile health clinics or vans can also reach out to underserved populations in remote areas.
4. Community-based Healthcare: Involving local communities in healthcare delivery can help build trust and increase participation. Community health workers (CHWs) can serve as intermediaries between healthcare providers and patients, providing basic health services and promoting health awareness.
5. Training and Capacity Building: Providing training and capacity building programs for healthcare professionals in underserved areas can help improve the quality of care and increase accessibility. This can include training programs for CHWs, nurses, and other frontline health workers.
6. Health Insurance Schemes: Implementing or expanding health insurance schemes can help reduce out-of-pocket expenses for patients, especially those from lower-income households. This can encourage people to seek medical care without worrying about financial burdens.
7. Public Education and Awareness: Raising public awareness about the importance of healthcare and the need for equitable access can help promote a culture of preventive care and early intervention. Public education campaigns can emphasize the benefits of regular check-ups, vaccinations, and other preventive measures.
