1. Offer a variety of activities: Provide a range of activities that cater to different interests and preferences, such as language classes, cultural workshops, and social events. This will help ensure that everyone feels included and engaged.
2. Make it accessible: Ensure that the event is easily accessible for all participants, including those who may have mobility issues or other accessibility needs. Provide clear instructions on how to get to the event location, and make sure there are enough parking spaces and transportation options available.
3. Use inclusive language: Make sure that all communication materials, such as flyers, posters, and social media posts, are in both English and Chinese. This will help ensure that everyone feels included and valued.
