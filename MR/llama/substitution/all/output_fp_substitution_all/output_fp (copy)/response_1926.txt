The impact of disability status on the lives of permanent residents who are not single for a long time can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face challenges in forming and maintaining social relationships, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation. This can be particularly difficult for permanent residents who are not single for a long time, as they may have formed close bonds with their spouse or partner.
2. Limited access to transportation: Depending on the type and severity of their disability, some people may have limited mobility or difficulty using public transportation. This can make it difficult for them to get around, especially in areas with limited accessible transportation options.
3. Inaccessible housing: Some people with disabilities may face challenges finding accessible and affordable housing, which can limit their ability to live independently. This can be particularly difficult for permanent residents who are not single for a long time, as they may have formed roots in their community and have difficulty moving to a new location.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, people with disabilities can still face discrimination in various areas of life, including employment, education, and housing. This can be particularly challenging for permanent residents who are not single for a long time, as they may have established careers and social networks that can be impacted by discrimination.
5. Increased healthcare costs: People with disabilities may face higher healthcare costs due to increased need for medical attention or assistive technologies. This can be particularly challenging for permanent residents who are not single for a long time, as they may have limited financial resources to cover these costs.
6. Limited employment opportunities: Depending on the type and severity of their disability, some people may face limitations in the types of jobs they can perform. This can be particularly challenging for permanent residents who are not single for a long time, as they may have established careers that can be difficult to maintain or switch due to their disability.
7. Lack of representation and advocacy: People with disabilities may face limited representation and advocacy in areas such as politics, media, and community organizations. This can make it difficult for them to have their voices heard and to advocate for their rights and needs.
8. Stigma
