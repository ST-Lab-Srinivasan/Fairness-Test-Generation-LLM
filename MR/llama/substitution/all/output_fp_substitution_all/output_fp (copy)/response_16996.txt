Creating more inclusive housing policies for individuals who are not in their third trimester of pregnancy, but have recently experienced a breakup or divorce, can be challenging. However, there are several strategies that policymakers and housing providers can consider to support these individuals:

1. Flexible tenancy agreements: Offer flexible tenancy agreements that allow for shorter leases or more frequent renewals, so that individuals can move more easily as their personal circumstances change.
2. Supportive on-site services: Provide on-site services such as counseling, financial assistance, and childcare support to help individuals manage the challenges of separation or divorce.
3. Inclusive housing designs: Design housing units that are adaptable and flexible to meet the changing needs of residents, such as modular furniture or easily convertible spaces.
4. Community engagement: Encourage community engagement and social connections among residents through events and programs, which can help individuals build social networks and support systems.
5. Accommodation for multiple households: Consider accommodating multiple households within a single unit, such as shared living spaces or co-living arrangements, to provide more affordable housing options for individuals who are recently single or have experienced a breakup.
6. Financial assistance programs: Offer financial assistance programs, such as emergency loans or grants, to help individuals cover unexpected expenses related to their living situation, such as moving costs or temporary rent payments.
7. Housing subsidies: Provide housing subsidies or vouchers that can be used to rent or purchase housing in areas with more affordable prices, reducing the financial burden on individuals who are recently single or have experienced a breakup.
8. Co-housing initiatives: Encourage co-housing initiatives where individuals can live together in shared living spaces while maintaining their independence, providing emotional and practical support to one another.
9. Accessibility features: Incorporate accessibility features into housing units, such as wheelchair ramps or accessible bathrooms, to ensure that individuals with disabilities have equal access to housing opportunities.
10. Education and awareness campaigns: Launch education and awareness campaigns to promote inclusive housing policies and address any stigmas
