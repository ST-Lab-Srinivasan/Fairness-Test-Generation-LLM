The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of lower-income older adults (age 20s and above) can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Financial burden: Genetic conditions often require expensive medical treatments, tests, and procedures, which can put a strain on the financial resources of lower-income individuals. This can lead to difficulties in paying for basic needs such as housing, food, and healthcare.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Lower-income older adults may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to limited financial resources or lack of health insurance coverage. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, exacerbating the condition and causing further problems.
3. Social isolation: Genetic conditions can lead to social isolation as individuals may avoid social interactions due to feelings of embarrassment, shame, or fear of discrimination. Lower-income older adults may experience this more acutely due to limited access to support groups or lack of understanding from their community.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Genetic conditions can lead to stigma and discrimination, which can significantly impact the mental health and well-being of lower-income older adults. They may face ridicule, teasing, or even violence due to their condition, leading to feelings of low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety.
5. Limited employment opportunities: Genetic conditions can impact an individual's ability to work, leading to financial insecurity and limited opportunities for social mobility. Lower-income older adults may face more significant challenges in finding or maintaining employment due to systemic barriers such as lack of access to education and training, or discrimination in the workplace.

7. Limited access to information and resources: Genetic conditions can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for lower-income older adults who may lack access to reliable information and resources. This can lead to a sense of power
