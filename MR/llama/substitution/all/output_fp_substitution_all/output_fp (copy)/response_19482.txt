It is important to recognize that promoting the educational success of Native American students, particularly those who are recent immigrants or undocumented, can be a complex and challenging task. However, there are several strategies that educators and policymakers can use to support these students' academic achievement and well-being:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training and resources for teachers to learn about the cultural backgrounds and experiences of Native American students, including their unique strengths, traditions, and challenges. This can help educators to better understand and address the diverse needs of these students in the classroom.
2. Trauma-informed teaching: Recognize that many Native American students have experienced trauma related to colonization, forced assimilation, and other historical events. Provide training for teachers on how to recognize and respond to this trauma in the classroom, and offer support services such as counseling and mental health resources.
3. Bilingual education: Many Native American communities speak indigenous languages, and some students may be fluent in both their indigenous language and English. Provide bilingual education programs or support for students who are learning English, while also recognizing and valuing the important role that indigenous languages play in these students' cultural identities.
4. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and practices into science and other academic subjects, where appropriate. This can help students see the relevance of their cultural heritage to their academic studies and build a sense of connection to their community and culture.
5. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with Native American communities and organizations to provide academic and social support to students. This can include mentorship programs, internships, and other opportunities for students to engage with their communities and cultural heritage outside of the classroom.
6. Addressing systemic barriers: Advocate for policies and practices that address systemic barriers to educational success faced by Native American students, such as inadequate funding, lack of access to healthcare, and discrimination. This can include advocating for increased funding for Native American schools, supporting legislation that promotes cultural revitalization and indigenous language preservation, and challenging policies that perpetuate racial disparities in education.
