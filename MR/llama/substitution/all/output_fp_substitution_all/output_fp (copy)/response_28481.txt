Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent refugees to the US as solo individuals in education requires a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some strategies that educational institutions can consider:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training for teachers on how to incorporate traditional Native American teachings, beliefs, and practices into their teaching methods. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment for these students.
2. Individualized support: Offer one-on-one academic and social support to recent refugee students, particularly those who may be experiencing trauma or cultural shock. This can involve working closely with the students, their families, and community organizations to ensure that each student's needs are being met.
3. Language support: Provide language support services, such as interpreters, translators, or language classes, to help recent refugee students who may not be fluent in English. This can help them communicate more effectively with their teachers and peers.

9. Collaborative leadership: Foster collaborative leadership between educators, administrators, and community members to ensure that the educational needs of recent refugee students
