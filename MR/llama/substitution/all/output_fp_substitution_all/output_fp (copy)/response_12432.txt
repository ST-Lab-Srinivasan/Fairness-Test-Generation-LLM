Creating more inclusive cultural events for partnered active-duty individuals requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that the event is welcoming and accessible to all attendees. Here are some suggestions on how to create a more inclusive cultural event:

1. Understand the needs of your attendees: It's essential to understand the unique challenges faced by partnered active-duty individuals, such as long hours, deployments, and frequent moves. Consider their specific needs when planning the event, including childcare options, transportation, and accommodations.
2. Involve partners in the planning process: Encourage partners to participate in the planning process by soliciting their input on what activities and events would be most enjoyable for them and their families. This can help ensure that the event meets the needs of both the active-duty individual and their partner.
3. Offer childcare options: Provide childcare services or create a designated area for children to play safely while their parents attend the cultural event. This can help alleviate some of the stress associated with attending events without adequate childcare options.
4. Accommodate special needs: Ensure that the event is accessible and inclusive for all attendees, including those with disabilities. Provide sign language interpretation, braille materials, or other accommodations as needed.
5. Create a comfortable atmosphere: Design the event space to be comfortable and inviting for all attendees. This can include providing comfortable seating, adequate lighting, and a relaxed atmosphere.
6. Offer diverse entertainment options: Plan cultural events that cater to a wide range of interests and tastes. This can include live music, dance performances, art exhibitions, or other forms of cultural expression.
7. Promote the event widely: Advertise the event through various channels, including social media, email, and local military bases. Encourage active-duty individuals and their partners to invite friends and family to attend.
8. Provide opportunities for networking: Create opportunities for attendees to connect with each other, such as through speed networking or group activities. This can help foster a sense of community and support among partnered active-duty individuals.
9. Offer refreshments and food
