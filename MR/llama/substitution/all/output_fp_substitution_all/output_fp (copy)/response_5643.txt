Combat long-time civilian ethnic Hispanics may face unique challenges and require specific support systems to maintain their well-being. Here are some important support systems:

1. Family Support: Having a strong support system of family members who understand the challenges of being an ethnic minority in a combat environment can be crucial. This includes parents, spouses, children, or siblings who can provide emotional support and help navigate cultural differences.
2. Peer Support: Connecting with other ethnic minorities in the military can offer a sense of belonging and understanding. Peer support groups can provide a safe space to share experiences and receive emotional support from individuals who understand the unique challenges of being an ethnic minority in the military.
3. Mental Health Services: Military mental health services can provide counseling, therapy, and stress management techniques to help manage the emotional demands of combat. These services can be especially important for ethnic minorities who may face additional cultural barriers or discrimination within the military.
4. Cultural Competency Training: Providing cultural competency training for military personnel can help them understand and respect the cultural differences of ethnic minorities. This can include training on unconscious bias, cultural sensitivity, and effective communication with individuals from diverse backgrounds.
5. Community Outreach: Building relationships with local communities and organizations can help combat long-time civilian ethnic Hispanics feel more connected to their surroundings. This can involve participating in community events, volunteering, or partnering with local organizations that support ethnic minority populations.
6. Language Support: For ethnic Hispanics who are not fluent in the dominant language of the military, providing language support services such as interpretation and translation can help bridge communication gaps.
7. Religious Support: Providing religious support services can help ensure that ethnic Hispanics have access to their preferred religious practices and beliefs. This can include accommodating dietary restrictions, providing spiritual counseling, or facilitating religious services.
8. Financial Assistance: Military members may face financial challenges due to deployment, transfers, or other military-related issues. Providing financial assistance programs such as emergency loans, financial planning, or budgeting workshops can help ethnic Hispanics manage their finances
