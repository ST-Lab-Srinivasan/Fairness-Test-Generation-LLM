Promoting the accessibility of public services for very elderly (90s+) non-high-income individuals requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various barriers to access. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Transportation: Provide accessible and affordable transportation options, such as wheelchair-accessible vehicles or door-to-door services, to ensure that older adults can easily access public services.
2. Accessibility features: Ensure that public buildings and facilities are accessible and easy to navigate for individuals with mobility impairments. This includes installing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
3. Assistive technology: Provide assistive technology devices, such as audio descriptions or large print materials, to help older adults access information and services.
4. Language support: Offer language support services, such as interpreters or translated materials, to ensure that older adults who are limited English proficient can access services.
5. Outreach and education: Conduct outreach and education campaigns to raise awareness about the availability of accessible public services and how to access them. This can be done through community events, workshops, or one-on-one consultations.
6. Alternative communication methods: Provide alternative communication methods, such as tactile graphics or Braille, for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
7. Home-based services: Offer home-based services, such as meal delivery or housekeeping, to help older adults maintain their independence and avoid the need to travel to access services.
8. Collaboration with service providers: Work with service providers, such as senior centers or non-profit organizations, to offer a range of services that are accessible and convenient for older adults.
9. User-friendly systems: Develop user-friendly systems, such as online portals or mobile apps, to make it easier for older adults to access public services and manage their appointments and payments.
10. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policies that promote accessibility and inclusion, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Older Americans Act (OAA), which provide guidelines and funding for accessible services.
