Creating more inclusive cultural programs for culturally Hindu beginner English speakers requires understanding and respecting their cultural background. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Engage with the local Hindu community to get feedback on what they would like to see in a cultural program. This will help ensure that the program is culturally relevant and meaningful to them.
2. Provide cultural context: Offer explanations and background information on Hindu customs, traditions, and beliefs to help beginners understand the cultural significance of the events.
3. Use accessible language: Avoid using complex Hindi or Sanskrit terms that may be difficult for English speakers to understand. Instead, use simple language that is easy to comprehend.
4. Offer translation support: Provide translation support during events or workshops to help beginners who may not be fluent in Hindi or other Indian languages.
5. Create a welcoming environment: Ensure that the program creates a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere for beginners who may feel out of place in traditional cultural settings.
6. Foster intercultural exchange: Organize events or workshops where beginners can interact with experienced Hindus, fostering cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
7. Provide educational resources: Offer educational resources such as books, videos, or online courses that teach Hindu customs, traditions, and beliefs in an accessible and beginner-friendly manner.
8. Host cultural events: Organize cultural events that showcase Hindu festivals, rituals, and practices in a way that is respectful and inclusive of beginners.
9. Create a safe space: Establish a safe space for beginners to ask questions and share their experiences without fear of judgment or ridicule.
