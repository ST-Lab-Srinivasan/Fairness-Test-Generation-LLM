Lower-income refugees face numerous challenges in accessing and navigating the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Lack of Documentation: Many lower-income refugees lack the necessary documents, such as a valid passport or immigration papers, to access healthcare services. This can make it difficult for them to receive medical care, especially in countries with strict documentation requirements.
2. Limited Access to Healthcare Facilities: Refugees often face barriers when trying to access healthcare facilities, including language barriers, transportation difficulties, and lack of knowledge about available services.
3. Financial Barriers: Lower-income refugees may struggle to pay for medical care, especially in countries with high out-of-pocket costs or limited government assistance programs. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, exacerbating health problems.
4. Cultural and Language Barriers: Refugees may face cultural and language barriers when seeking healthcare, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their health needs.
5. Trauma and Mental Health Issues: Many refugees have experienced trauma and violence in their home countries or during their journey to the host country. They may struggle with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, they may face barriers when trying to access mental health services due to language barriers or limited cultural competency among healthcare providers.
6. Discrimination and Stigma: Refugees may experience discrimination and stigma from healthcare providers or community members, which can lead to feelings of isolation and mistrust.
7. Limited Knowledge about Health Issues: Refugees may have limited knowledge about health issues in their host country, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system effectively.
8. Lack of Trust: Refugees may lack trust in the healthcare system due to past experiences or cultural beliefs, which can lead to delayed or foregone care.
9. Limited Access to Specialized Care: Refugees may have limited access to specialized care, such as pediatric or maternity services, due to language barriers or lack of knowledge about available services.
