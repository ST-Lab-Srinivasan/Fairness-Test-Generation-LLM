As a native French speaker and beginner Arabic speaker, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in an Arabic-speaking country. Here are some potential challenges you may encounter:

1. Language barrier: The biggest challenge faced by native French speakers in the legal system of an Arabic-speaking country is the language barrier. As a beginner Arabic speaker, you may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures, which can make it difficult to navigate the system effectively.
