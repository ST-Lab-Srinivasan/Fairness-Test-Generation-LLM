Ensuring that the healthcare needs of individuals with a mixed Hispanic heritage and genetic conditions are met requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique cultural, linguistic, and social factors. Here are some strategies to address this challenge:

This involves training healthcare providers on cultural issues relevant to this population, such as language barriers, dietary restrictions, and spiritual beliefs.
