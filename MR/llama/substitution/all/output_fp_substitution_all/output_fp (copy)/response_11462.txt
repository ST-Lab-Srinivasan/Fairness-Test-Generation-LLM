I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any racial or ethnic group being "elite" or "upper class." Additionally, it is important to recognize that cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of people from all backgrounds and communities, regardless of their socioeconomic status.

It is essential to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or making assumptions about individuals based on their race or ethnicity. Instead, it is important to recognize and celebrate the diversity of cultures and experiences that make up our society. By promoting inclusivity and understanding, we can work towards a more equitable and just society for everyone.

In conclusion, cultural diversity plays a vital role in enriching the lives of people from all backgrounds and communities. It is important to recognize and celebrate this diversity, rather than making harmful generalizations or assumptions about any racial or ethnic group. By promoting inclusivity and understanding, we can work towards a more equitable and just society for everyone.
