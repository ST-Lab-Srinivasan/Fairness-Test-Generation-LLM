Not upper middle-income permanent residents may face a range of challenges in accessing and affording quality healthcare in their host country. Some of the common challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare services: Lower-income individuals may struggle to afford health insurance or may not have access to quality healthcare providers due to lack of availability in their area.
2. Language barriers: Non-native speakers may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, especially if they do not speak the local language fluently.
3. Limited knowledge of the healthcare system: Newly arrived immigrants may be unfamiliar with the healthcare system in their host country, making it challenging to navigate and access care.
4. Cultural differences: Health beliefs and practices may differ across cultures, leading to potential misunderstandings or miscommunications between patients and healthcare providers.
5. Discrimination and stigma: Lower-income individuals or those from marginalized communities may experience discrimination or stigma when accessing healthcare services.
6. Financial barriers: Out-of-pocket costs, co-payments, and deductibles can create financial burdens for lower-income individuals, making it difficult to access necessary healthcare services.
7. Limited transportation options: Without reliable transportation, non-upper middle-income permanent residents may face difficulties in getting to appointments or picking up prescriptions.
8. Employment-related challenges: Lower-income workers may have unpredictable schedules or limited sick leave, making it difficult to manage healthcare appointments and treatments.
9. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on the country and region, lower-income individuals may not have access to specialized medical care, such as cancer treatment or mental health services.
10. Lack of social support: Lower-income individuals may face social isolation, which can negatively impact their overall health and well-being.

To address these challenges, policymakers and healthcare providers can implement strategies to improve access to quality healthcare for non-upper middle-income permanent residents, such as:

1. Expanding insurance coverage and financial assistance programs.
2. Providing language interpretation services and cultural sensitivity training
