Introduction:

Marriage and disability can have a significant impact on an individual's life. In the case of physically disabled native Arabic speakers, there may be additional challenges related to cultural and societal expectations, language barriers, and accessibility issues. This study aims to explore the impact of marital status on the lives of physically disabled native Arabic speaker individuals.

Literature Review:

Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on individuals with disabilities. On one hand, marriage can provide emotional support, financial stability, and social inclusion (Hackett et al., 2017). On the other hand, it can also create additional challenges related to caregiving responsibilities, stigma, and discrimination (Bhugra et al., 2008).

For physically disabled native Arabic speakers, there may be additional cultural and societal expectations that can impact their marital experiences. In many Arab cultures, marriage is seen as a union between two families rather than between two individuals (Hardoon et al., 2016). This can create pressure on physically disabled individuals to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations, which may be challenging for them given their disability-related limitations.

Moreover, language barriers can also play a significant role in the marital experiences of physically disabled native Arabic speakers. Many physically disabled individuals may face communication difficulties due to their disability, which can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization (Al-Sharif et al., 2017).

Methodology:

This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with physically disabled native Arabic speakers who are married or in a romantic relationship. Participants will be recruited through local disability organizations and online support groups. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather data on the impact of marital status on the participants' lives, including their experiences with caregiving, stigma, and discrimination.

Results:

The results of this study will provide insights into the experiences of physically disabled native Arabic speakers in relation to marital status. The following themes are expected to emerge from the
