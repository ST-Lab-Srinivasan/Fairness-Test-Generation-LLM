Instead of focusing on the economic empowerment of specific racial or ethnic groups, it is more important to address the systemic barriers and inequalities that exist in society. This can involve implementing policies and practices that promote greater equality and inclusion, such as:

1. Education and skills development: Providing access to quality education and training programs can help individuals from underrepresented groups acquire the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the economy.
2. Access to capital and funding: Ensuring that individuals from underrepresented groups have equal access to capital and funding opportunities can help them start and grow their businesses.
3. Diversity and inclusion initiatives: Implementing diversity and inclusion initiatives in the workplace can help create a more inclusive and equitable environment for individuals from underrepresented groups.
4. Addressing systemic barriers: Identifying and addressing systemic barriers, such as discrimination and bias, can help create a more level playing field for all individuals.
5. Encouraging entrepreneurship: Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation can help create new opportunities and jobs for individuals from underrepresented groups.
