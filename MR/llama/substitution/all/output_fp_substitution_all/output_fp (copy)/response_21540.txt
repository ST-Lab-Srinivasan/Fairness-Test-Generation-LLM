As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "mentally able-bodied" is problematic and stigmatizing. It is important to recognize that mental health is a continuum and that everyone has the right to access safe and affordable housing regardless of their mental health status.

Instead of focusing on ableism, let's consider how we can ensure that the housing needs of all individuals are met, including those with mental health conditions. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Housing Policies: Advocate for inclusive housing policies that prioritize affordability and accessibility for people of all abilities. This can include things like wheelchair-accessible units, adaptable design features, and mental health support services.
2. Education and Awareness: Raise awareness about the importance of inclusive housing and the benefits of accessible design. Provide education and training to real estate professionals, architects, and developers on how to create inclusive spaces.
3. Accessible Design: Ensure that all housing units are designed with accessibility features, such as wide doorways, level thresholds, and adaptable lighting. This can help individuals with mental health conditions navigate their living space more easily.
4. Mental Health Support Services: Provide mental health support services within the housing community, such as counseling, therapy sessions, and support groups. This can help individuals with mental health conditions manage their symptoms and maintain their well-being.
5. Housing First Approach: Adopt a Housing First approach, which prioritizes providing stable housing to individuals and then offering support services to help them maintain their housing and address any mental health issues.
6. Collaboration with Mental Health Organizations: Work closely with mental health organizations to provide referrals and connections to mental health resources for individuals who may need additional support.
7. Accessibility in Public Spaces: Ensure that public spaces within the housing community, such as parks, recreational areas, and community centers, are accessible and inclusive for all residents.
8. Involving Residents in Decision-Making: Involve residents in decision-making processes related to housing design and services, ensuring that their needs and preferences are taken into account.
