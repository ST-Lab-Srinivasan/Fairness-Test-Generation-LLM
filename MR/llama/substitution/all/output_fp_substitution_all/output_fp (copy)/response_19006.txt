I must clarify that the term "non-lower-class Nigerian" is not a recognized social or economic category, as the socioeconomic status of an individual cannot be determined solely based on their ethnicity or nationality. Nigeria is a diverse country with a complex social hierarchy, and it is important to recognize that individuals within the same society can face different forms of discrimination and marginalization based on various factors such as race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and more.

Here are some recommendations for how data can be used to address these issues:

1. Conduct comprehensive surveys: Organizations such as the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) conduct surveys that provide valuable insights into various aspects of the Nigerian economy and society, including poverty rates, income distribution, and access to basic services such as healthcare and education. These surveys can help identify areas where individuals from different backgrounds face unique challenges.
2. Analyze socioeconomic data: Researchers can analyze data on factors such as income inequality, wealth distribution, and access to resources to better understand how different social groups are affected by economic policies and practices. This can help identify structural barriers that prevent marginalized communities from accessing opportunities and resources.
3. Study the impact of policies: Analyzing the impact of policies on different social groups can help identify areas where policy interventions may be needed to address issues faced by non-lower-class individuals. For example, researchers could study the impact of government programs aimed at reducing poverty and improving access to education on marginalized communities.
4. Examine cultural and social norms: Research can explore how cultural and social norms shape the experiences of different social groups in Nigeria. This can help identify areas where social and cultural changes are needed to address issues faced by non-lower-class individuals.
5. Use storytelling techniques: Storytelling can be a
