As an ultra-liberal person learning Chinese, you may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some potential obstacles and ways to overcome them:

1. Lack of language proficiency: One of the biggest challenges for beginner Chinese speakers is the lack of language proficiency. To overcome this, focus on practicing your speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills regularly. Consider taking language courses or using language learning apps to improve your skills.
2. Limited job opportunities: As an ultra-liberal person, you may face discrimination or limited job opportunities due to your political beliefs. To overcome this, consider networking with other like-minded individuals and creating a professional community that supports your values. You can also look for jobs in industries that are more accepting of diverse perspectives, such as non-profit organizations, educational institutions, or creative fields.
3. Cultural differences: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may encounter cultural differences that can affect your job performance. For example, in some Asian cultures, direct communication styles may be preferred over indirect communication styles. To overcome this, research and learn about the cultural norms of the countries where you plan to work, and adapt your communication style accordingly.
4. Stereotyping and bias: As an ultra-liberal person, you may face stereotyping or bias based on your political beliefs. To overcome this, focus on building your skills and credentials, and avoid discussing your political views in job interviews or professional settings. Instead, emphasize your strengths and qualifications, and showcase your ability to work with diverse groups of people.
5. Limited resources: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may have limited access to resources such as language learning materials, job listings, or networking opportunities. To overcome this, seek out online communities or language exchange programs that can provide support and resources for learners. You can also leverage social media platforms to connect with other language learners and professionals in your field.
6. Difficulty in finding a job: As an ultra-liberal person, you may face discrimination or difficulty in finding a job due to your political beliefs. To overcome this, consider volunteering or taking on freelance work to gain experience and build your portfolio. You
