As a native French speaker and natural-born US citizen, I have experienced firsthand the challenges faced by individuals like me in the US healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Language barriers: For those who are not fluent in English, navigating the healthcare system can be difficult. Many hospitals and medical providers do not offer translation services, making it hard for non-English speakers to communicate their symptoms or understand their treatment plans.
2. Cultural differences: The US healthcare system is highly influenced by American culture, which may not align with the cultural values and beliefs of immigrant populations. For example, some cultures may have different attitudes towards medical care, or they may place a greater emphasis on alternative therapies.
3. Access to care: Immigrants may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to their immigration status. For instance, undocumented immigrants may be reluctant to seek medical attention for fear of deportation, while those with legal status may encounter difficulties in finding affordable insurance.
4. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not always be aware of the cultural nuances and beliefs of diverse patient populations. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, or even mistrust.

6. Financial barriers: Immigrants may face financial challenges in affording healthcare services, especially if they lack access to affordable insurance or have limited financial resources.
7. Discrimination: Unfortunately, some immigrant populations may experience discrimination when seeking medical care, particularly those from marginalized communities. This can lead to mistrust and hesitance to seek necessary care.
8. Difficulty navigating the system: The complexities of the US healthcare system can be overwhelming for anyone, let alone those who are not familiar with the language or cultural norms. Non-native English speakers may struggle to navigate the system, including understanding insurance options, finding affordable care, and accessing necessary resources.
9. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on their immigration status or insurance coverage
