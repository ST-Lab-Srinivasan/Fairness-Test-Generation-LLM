Promoting the inclusion of low-earning, no known genetic conditions individuals in professional athletics can be achieved through a multi-faceted approach that addresses various barriers and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and Awareness: Raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity in sports and the potential benefits of participating in athletics for individuals with low earnings or no known genetic conditions. This can be done through workshops, seminars, and campaigns that target coaches, athletes, and other stakeholders.
2. Access to Resources: Provide resources such as training facilities, equipment, and coaching services to individuals who may not have access to these opportunities otherwise. This can help level the playing field and provide equal opportunities for all athletes.
3. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair experienced athletes with those who are just starting out. This can provide guidance, support, and motivation to help individuals overcome challenges and reach their full potential.
4. Scholarships and Financial Support: Offer scholarships and financial support to individuals who may not have the means to participate in sports due to financial constraints. This can help remove financial barriers and provide equal opportunities for all athletes.
5. Adaptive Sports Programs: Develop adaptive sports programs that cater to the unique needs of individuals with low earnings or no known genetic conditions. These programs can provide modified sports equipment, modified rules, and trained coaches and officials to ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all athletes.
6. Advocacy and Policy Change: Work with advocacy groups and policymakers to push for policy changes that promote inclusivity in sports. This can include measures such as anti-discrimination laws, accessibility standards, and funding opportunities specifically designed for individuals with low earnings or no known genetic conditions.
7. Media Representation: Promote media representation of athletes with low earnings or no known genetic conditions to challenge stereotypes and biases and increase visibility and acceptance of these athletes in society.
8. Community Engagement: Engage with local communities and involve them in the promotion of inclusivity in sports. This can be done through outreach programs, community events
