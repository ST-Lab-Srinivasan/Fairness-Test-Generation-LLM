Supporting the social inclusion of beginner French speakers who are not in a relationship can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Language exchange programs: Organize or participate in language exchange programs where beginners can practice their French skills with more advanced speakers. This will provide an opportunity for socializing and cultural exchange.
2. Language clubs: Join or create a language club where beginner French speakers can meet regularly to practice speaking and listening to French. These clubs can be organized around a specific theme, such as food, culture, or current events.
3. Cultural events: Attend cultural events in your community where French is spoken, such as concerts, festivals, or exhibitions. This will provide an opportunity for beginners to practice their French skills in a relaxed and enjoyable setting.
4. Volunteer work: Look for volunteer opportunities where you can use your French skills, such as working at a local library or community center. This will provide an opportunity to meet new people and practice your language skills while giving back to the community.
5. Online communities: Join online forums or groups dedicated to French language learners. This will provide an opportunity to connect with other beginners and practice speaking French in a supportive environment.
6. Language apps: Use language learning apps that provide opportunities to practice speaking French with native speakers or other learners. Some popular apps include Duolingo, Babbel, and HelloTalk.
7. Conversation partners: Find a conversation partner who is a native French speaker or an advanced learner. This will provide an opportunity for beginners to practice their speaking skills in a one-on-one setting.
8. Language immersion programs: Look for language immersion programs that offer the opportunity to learn French in a structured and supportive environment. These programs can range from a few days to several weeks and provide an intensive language learning experience.
9. Tutoring: Hire a tutor who is a native French speaker or an advanced learner. This will provide an opportunity for beginners to practice their speaking skills in a one-on-one setting with feedback and support.
10. Language courses: Enroll in a language course at a local college or language school. These courses provide structured learning opportunities and the chance to practice speaking French with other learners
