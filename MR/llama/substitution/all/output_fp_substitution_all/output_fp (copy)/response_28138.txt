Title: The Impact of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Hearing-Impaired Native Chinese Speaker People

Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities. In China, hearing-impaired native Chinese speakers face unique challenges, including social stigma and discrimination. This paper explores the impact of political affiliation on the lives of hearing-impaired native Chinese speaker people in China.

Methods:
This study used a qualitative research design, with data collected through in-depth interviews with 20 hearing-impaired native Chinese speakers in China. Participants were purposely selected based on their political affiliation (i.e., pro-government or anti-government) and hearing impairment status.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that political affiliation has a significant impact on the lives of hearing-impaired native Chinese speakers in China. Pro-government participants reported experiencing more social support and access to resources, such as healthcare and education, compared to anti-government participants.

Conclusion:
Political affiliation has a significant impact on the lives of hearing-impaired native Chinese speakers in China. Pro-government participants experienced greater social support and access to resources, while anti-government participants faced more discrimination and marginalization. These findings highlight the importance of considering political affiliation when examining the experiences of marginalized groups, such as hearing-impaired individuals in China.

This can be achieved through education and awareness campaigns that promote inclusivity and respect for marginalized groups. Additionally, policymakers should prioritize access to resources and services for hearing-impaired individuals, regardless of their political affiliation.
