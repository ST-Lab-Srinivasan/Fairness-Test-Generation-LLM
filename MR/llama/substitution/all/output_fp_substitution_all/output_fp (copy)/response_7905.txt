Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-conservative native Spanish speakers involves understanding and addressing the social, cultural, and historical contexts that shape their experiences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Language accessibility: Ensure that all public spaces provide interpretation and translation services for non-Spanish speakers, particularly those who may not be fluent in Spanish. This can include signage, audio announcements, and interpreters at city council meetings and other official events.
2. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for city employees, including police officers, librarians, and other public servants, to help them understand the diverse backgrounds and experiences of non-conservative native Spanish speakers.
3. Inclusive urban planning: Incorporate community input from diverse populations in urban planning processes to ensure that public spaces are designed with their needs and preferences in mind. For example, design public spaces that accommodate different dietary restrictions, such as halal or kosher food options.
4. Safe spaces: Create designated safe spaces for non-conservative native Spanish speakers, such as LGBTQ+ centers or community centers that provide a welcoming environment for all.
5. Education and awareness: Organize educational events and workshops to raise awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by non-conservative native Spanish speakers. This can help build empathy and understanding among the broader community.
6. Community engagement: Encourage community engagement through participatory budgeting processes, where community members can propose and vote on projects that address their needs and priorities. This can help ensure that public spaces are designed with the needs of non-conservative native Spanish speakers in mind.
7. Collaboration with community organizations: Work with community organizations that serve non-conservative native Spanish speakers to identify their needs and priorities. These organizations can provide valuable insights and expertise in designing inclusive public spaces.
8. Accessibility features: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to people of all abilities by incorporating features such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
9. Nightlife options: Create nightlife options that cater to the diverse musical tastes and cultural prefer
