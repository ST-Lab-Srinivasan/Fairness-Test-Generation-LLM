Creating more inclusive public spaces for over 90-year-old Orthodox Jewish individuals requires consideration of their unique needs and cultural practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people with mobility issues, including those who use wheelchairs or have difficulty walking. Provide ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
2. Modesty considerations: Orthodox Jewish individuals may have specific modesty requirements, such as separating men and women in public spaces or providing separate facilities for each gender. Consider these needs when designing the space.
3. Kosher food options: Provide kosher food options in the public space, including meals and snacks. This can help ensure that older adults who follow kosher dietary restrictions have access to nutritious and appropriate food.
4. Cultural activities: Incorporate cultural activities and events that cater to the needs and interests of older Orthodox Jewish adults. This can include lectures, concerts, and other forms of entertainment that reflect their heritage and traditions.
5. Social interaction: Encourage social interaction among older adults by creating spaces for them to gather and connect with one another. This can help combat loneliness and isolation, which are common issues among this age group.
6. Technology integration: Utilize technology to enhance the public space and make it more accessible to older adults. For example, provide tablets or smartphones with larger fonts and simpler navigation for those with vision or dexterity challenges.
7. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by using calming colors, sounds, and lighting. This can help reduce stress and anxiety among older adults who may be sensitive to certain stimuli.
8. Collaboration with local organizations: Partner with local Orthodox Jewish organizations to provide additional support and resources for older adults. This can include transportation services, home repair assistance, and other forms of aid.
9. Educational programming: Offer educational programming that cater to the interests and needs of older Orthodox Jewish adults. This can include classes on Jewish history, culture, and religion, as well as practical life skills training.
10. Inclusive marketing: Promote the public space in
