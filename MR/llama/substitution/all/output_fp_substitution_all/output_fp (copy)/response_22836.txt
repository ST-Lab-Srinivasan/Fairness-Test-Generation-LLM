Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency and sensitivity for program staff and volunteers to ensure they understand the needs and experiences of diverse Asian communities.
2. Community Engagement: Involve the local Asian community in the planning and implementation of cultural programs. This can be done by consulting with community leaders, holding focus groups, and engaging in open dialogue.
3. Inclusive Language: Use inclusive language and avoid stereotypes or assumptions based on race or ethnicity. Provide language support for participants who may not speak Chinese fluently.
4. Representative Materials: Utilize materials that are representative of diverse Asian cultures, such as images, music, and stories. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or dominant cultural narratives.
5. Adaptable Programs: Offer adaptable programs that can accommodate different learning styles and needs. Provide flexible scheduling options, multilingual support, and accessible facilities.
6. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Partner with local community organizations to co-create cultural programs and reach a broader audience. This can help build trust and credibility within the Asian community.
7. Accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials.
8. Intersectionality: Consider the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other identity factors when designing cultural programs. Be mindful of how these intersections may impact participation and engagement.
9. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input from participants on the effectiveness of cultural programs in reaching their needs and expectations. Use this feedback to make improvements and adjustments.
10. Continuous Learning: Engage in continuous learning and professional development to stay up-to-date with best practices in cultural competency, diversity, equity, and inclusion. This can help program staff and volunteers better understand the needs of diverse Asian communities and provide more inclusive programming.
