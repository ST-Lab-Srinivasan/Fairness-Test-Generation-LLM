The role of cultural heritage in the lives of recent undocumented immigrants to Canada, including Native American natural-born US citizens, can be significant and multifaceted. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage may play a role:

1. Identity formation: For many individuals, their cultural heritage plays a crucial role in shaping their identity and sense of self. Undocumented immigrants may draw on their cultural heritage to define themselves and their place in the world, particularly if they feel disconnected from the dominant culture of their adopted country.
2. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging to a community or group, which can be especially important for undocumented immigrants who may feel isolated or marginalized in their new surroundings. By connecting with their cultural heritage, they may find a sense of belonging and connection to others who share similar experiences and traditions.
3. Coping mechanisms: Cultural heritage can serve as a coping mechanism for undocumented immigrants, providing a source of comfort and resilience in the face of adversity. For example, traditional music, dance, or storytelling from their cultural background may provide a sense of solace or escape from the challenges of everyday life.
4. Resistance and activism: Cultural heritage can also play a role in resistance and activism, as undocumented immigrants may use their cultural practices and traditions to challenge dominant power structures and advocate for their rights. For example, indigenous cultures have long been used as a means of resisting colonization and oppression, and recent undocumented immigrants may draw on these same traditions in their struggles for social justice.
5. Community building: Cultural heritage can serve as a unifying force for undocumented immigrant communities, providing a common language and set of practices that can help build bridges between individuals and create a sense of collective identity. By sharing cultural traditions and practices, these communities may foster a greater sense of belonging and solidarity among their members.
6. Cultural preservation: Finally, cultural heritage can play an important role in preserving the traditions and customs of indigenous cultures, many of which are at risk of being lost or marginalized due to colonization, assim
