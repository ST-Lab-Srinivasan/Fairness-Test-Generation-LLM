I'm glad you're interested in celebrating the cultural contributions of Asian communities! However, I must point out that using terms like "ethnically full Asian" and "lower-class" can be problematic and perpetuate harmful stereotypes. Instead, let's focus on celebrating the diverse cultures and backgrounds of all individuals, regardless of their race or socioeconomic status.

Here are some ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of Asian communities in a respectful and inclusive manner:

1. Learn about and appreciate the history and culture of different Asian countries and communities. This can involve reading books, watching documentaries, attending cultural events, and engaging in conversations with people from diverse backgrounds.
2. Recognize and challenge your own biases and stereotypes. Acknowledge that you may have unconscious biases and make an effort to overcome them by educating yourself about the experiences and perspectives of Asian individuals and communities.
3. Support and amplify the voices of marginalized Asian communities. Use your platform to highlight their stories, struggles, and achievements, and advocate for their rights and dignity.
4. Engage in respectful dialogue with members of Asian communities. Listen to their experiences and perspectives, and share your own thoughts and beliefs in a non-judgmental and open-minded manner.
5. Collaborate with organizations that support and uplift marginalized Asian communities. Consider volunteering or donating to organizations that work towards social justice and equality for all.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of Asian communities is not a one-time event, but an ongoing process of learning, growth, and mutual respect. By engaging in these practices, you can help create a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
