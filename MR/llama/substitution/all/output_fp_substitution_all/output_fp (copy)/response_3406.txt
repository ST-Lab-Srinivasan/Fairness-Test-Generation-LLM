Creating more inclusive social policies for unmarried refugees requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and discrimination faced by this group. Here are some recommendations:

1. Recognize the specific needs of unmarried refugees: Unmarried refugees, particularly those who are LGBTQ+ or have other marginalized identities, often face additional barriers in accessing basic rights and services. Policies should acknowledge these disparities and provide targeted support to address them.
2. Include unmarried refugees in the definition of "family": Many social policies are designed with the traditional nuclear family in mind. However, many refugees may not have access to the same level of support as they are not considered part of this normative framework. Policies should be inclusive and recognize that any individual or group can face displacement and marginalization.
3. Provide access to affordable housing: Unmarried refugees often struggle to find affordable and secure housing, which can exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. Policies should prioritize the provision of safe and decent housing options that are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their marital status or other factors.
4. Offer education and training opportunities: Many unmarried refugees face barriers to accessing education and job training due to discrimination, language barriers, and other factors. Policies should prioritize the provision of inclusive educational and vocational opportunities that address the unique needs of this population.
5. Address mental health and wellness: Unmarried refugees often face significant trauma and stress due to their experiences of displacement and marginalization. Policies should prioritize mental health support services that are tailored to the specific needs of this population.
6. Include unmarried refugees in decision-making processes: Unmarried refugees should be included in any decision-making processes related to their care and well-being. This can involve establishing mechanisms for their participation, such as community advisory boards or other forms of involvement.
7. Address discrimination and stigma: Unmarried refugees often face significant discrimination and stigma due to their marginalized identities. Policies should prioritize addressing these issues through awareness-raising
