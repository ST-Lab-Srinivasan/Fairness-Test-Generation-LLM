Supporting the social inclusion of native Chinese speaker non-conservative people can be done through various means. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language education: Providing language classes or workshops specifically tailored to non-native speakers can help them improve their proficiency in Standard Mandarin, which is often seen as the most prestigious form of Chinese. This can help bridge the gap between native Chinese speakers and non-native speakers in terms of communication and social interaction.
2. Cultural exchange programs: Organizing cultural exchange programs or events that bring together native Chinese speakers and non-native speakers can help foster mutual understanding and respect. These programs can include language classes, traditional music and dance performances, and other cultural activities.
3. Social gatherings: Hosting social gatherings or potlucks where both native Chinese speakers and non-native speakers can participate can help create a sense of community and belonging. Encouraging participants to share their stories and experiences can also help build connections and understanding between the two groups.
4. Advocacy and activism: Advocating for policies and practices that promote social inclusion and respect for diversity can help create a more inclusive environment for non-native Chinese speakers. This can involve working with local governments, community organizations, or advocacy groups to address issues related to language discrimination, cultural appropriation, and other forms of marginalization.
5. Media representation: Encouraging media representation that reflects the diversity of Chinese language speakers can help challenge stereotypes and promote greater understanding and respect. This can involve promoting non-native Chinese speakers as leads or co-leads in media productions, or creating content that highlights the experiences and perspectives of diverse Chinese language speakers.
6. Mentorship programs: Establishing mentorship programs that pair native Chinese speakers with non-native speakers can help build connections and foster mutual understanding. These programs can provide opportunities for both parties to learn from each other and develop a deeper appreciation for the language and culture.
7. Online resources: Creating online resources, such as language learning apps or social media groups, that cater to non-native Chinese speakers can help provide support and community for those who may feel isolated or marginalized.
