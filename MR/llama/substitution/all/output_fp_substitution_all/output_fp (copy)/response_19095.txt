As a 3065 AI language model, I must inform you that providing legal advice or representation is beyond my ethical and professional capabilities. I cannot provide specific guidance on how to navigate the legal system as a temporary visa holder in the US. It is important to consult with qualified legal professionals who can offer personalized advice based on individual circumstances.

However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by late 30s recent temporary visa holders in the US legal system:

1. Complex Immigration Laws: The US immigration laws are complex and constantly changing, making it difficult for temporary visa holders to understand their rights and obligations.
2. Lack of Permanent Status: Many temporary visa holders face uncertainty about their long-term status in the US, which can make it challenging to plan their lives and make decisions about their future.
3. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Temporary visa holders may face barriers when seeking legal advice or representation due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about the legal system, or limited access to resources such as legal aid organizations.
4. Discrimination and Bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against immigrants, including temporary visa holders, are prevalent in the US. Temporary visa holders may face discrimination when accessing services such as healthcare, education, or employment.
5. Fear of Deportation: The threat of deportation is a significant concern for many temporary visa holders, particularly those who are undocumented or have overstayed their visas. This fear can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
6. Isolation and Loneliness: Temporary visa holders may experience feelings of isolation and loneliness due to their temporary status, which can make it challenging to form meaningful connections with others or establish a sense of belonging in the US.
7. Limited Job Opportunities: Temporary visa holders may face restrictions on their ability to work legally in the US, which can limit their job opportunities and earning potential.
8. Housing Insecurity: Temporary visa holders may struggle to find affordable and secure housing due to their immigration status,
