As a beginner French speaker who is recently widowed, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some of the common obstacles and potential solutions:

1. Language barrier: As a beginner French speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively in a professional setting, particularly if you're applying for jobs that require fluency in French. Consider taking language classes or using online resources to improve your proficiency.
2. Lack of experience: If you've recently started learning French and are looking to enter the job market, you may lack experience in the field or industry you're interested in. Look for entry-level positions or internships to gain practical experience and build your skills.
