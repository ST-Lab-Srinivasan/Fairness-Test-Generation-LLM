Documented not lifelong married people, also known as "common-law" or "unmarried" couples, face unique challenges when it comes to accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the challenges they may encounter:

1. Lack of legal recognition: Unlike married couples, documented not lifelong married people do not have the same legal rights and protections under the law. This can lead to difficulties in areas such as inheritance, tax benefits, and decision-making authority in medical emergencies.
