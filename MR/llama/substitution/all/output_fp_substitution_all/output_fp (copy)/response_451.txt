Supporting the social inclusion of older adults, particularly those who are natural-born Indian citizens and advanced in age (over 90 years old), is essential for promoting their well-being and quality of life. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Age-friendly communities: Create age-friendly communities that cater to the needs of older adults. This can involve designing public spaces, transportation systems, and buildings to be more accessible and easier to navigate for people of all ages.
2. Intergenerational programs: Organize intergenerational programs that bring together older adults with younger generations. This can help bridge the gap between different age groups and promote understanding and empathy between them.
3. Technology training: Provide technology training sessions specifically designed for older adults to learn how to use digital tools and devices that can help them stay connected with loved ones, access information, and engage in various activities.
4. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage older adults to participate in volunteer opportunities within their communities. This can help them feel more connected and engaged with society while also contributing to the greater good.
5. Social gatherings: Organize social gatherings, such as potlucks or game nights, that bring together older adults and provide opportunities for them to interact with others their age.
6. Cognitive stimulation: Provide cognitive stimulation activities, such as puzzles, brain teasers, or creative pursuits, that can help older adults maintain cognitive function and social engagement.
7. Physical activity programs: Organize physical activity programs, such as exercise classes or sports teams, that cater to the needs of older adults and promote physical activity and social interaction.
8. Cultural events: Organize cultural events, such as music concerts or art exhibitions, that showcase the talents and achievements of older adults and provide opportunities for them to engage with younger generations.
9. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policies and practices that promote social inclusion of older adults, such as age-friendly housing, transportation systems, and employment opportunities.
10. Education and awareness: Educate the broader community about the importance of social inclusion of older adults
