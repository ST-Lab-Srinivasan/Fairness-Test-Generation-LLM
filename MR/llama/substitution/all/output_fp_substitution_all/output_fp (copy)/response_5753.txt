Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Beginner Spanish Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who are not recently widowed. In this study, we aim to investigate the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of beginner Spanish speakers. Specifically, we will explore how cultural heritage influences their language learning motivation, language use patterns, and overall identity formation.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity. For instance, studies have found that cultural heritage can influence an individual's sense of belonging, self-esteem, and overall worldview (Gill & Johnson, 2015). Moreover, cultural heritage can also shape an individual's language learning motivation and language use patterns (Laufer & Thorson, 2003). However, there is a lack of research on the specific role that cultural heritage plays in shaping the identities of beginner Spanish speakers.

Methodology:
To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a qualitative study with a sample of beginner Spanish speakers who were not recently widowed. We used semi-structured interviews to gather data on participants' cultural heritage, language learning motivation, language use patterns, and overall identity formation. We analyzed the data using thematic analysis, identifying key themes related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of beginner Spanish speakers.

Results:
Our findings revealed that cultural heritage played a significant role in shaping the identities of beginner Spanish speakers. Participants who had a strong cultural heritage were more likely to be motivated to learn Spanish due to a sense of connection to their cultural roots. They also tended to use Spanish language in more authentic and creative ways, reflecting their cultural backgrounds. Additionally, participants' cultural heritage influenced their overall identity formation, as they often saw themselves as part of a larger cultural narrative.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the important role that cultural heritage plays in shaping the identities of beginner Spanish speakers. By understanding how cultural heritage influences language learning motivation and language use patterns,
