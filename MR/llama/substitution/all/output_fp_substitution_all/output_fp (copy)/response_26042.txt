Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Native Undocumented Individuals in the US

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for those who are recent immigrants or undocumented to the United States.
