I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to use the term "ethnically full Hispanic" or to make generalizations about any group of people based on their race or ethnicity. Every individual is unique and deserving of respect and dignity, regardless of their cultural background or socioeconomic status.

Cultural diversity can play a significant role in enriching the lives of individuals from all backgrounds by providing opportunities for learning, growth, and personal development. It can help to break down stereotypes and promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity.

However, it's important to recognize that cultural diversity is not a panacea for addressing the systemic inequalities and discrimination that exist in society. Lower-class people from any racial or ethnic group may face significant barriers to opportunities and resources, and these challenges cannot be overcome solely through exposure to diverse cultures.

Instead, it's important to address the root causes of inequality and work towards creating a more just and equitable society for all. This may involve advocating for policies that promote access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities, as well as challenging systems of oppression and discrimination.

In short, cultural diversity can be a valuable tool for promoting understanding and inclusivity, but it is not a substitute for addressing the systemic issues that affect marginalized communities.
