As an ethical and empathetic assistant, I commend you for recognizing the importance of promoting the educational success of non-binary or gender-fluid students. It is crucial to create an inclusive and supportive environment that allows these students to thrive and reach their full potential. Here are some suggestions on how to promote the educational success of not recently single infant gender-fluid students:

1. Use inclusive language and practices: Use gender-neutral language and practices in the classroom, such as referring to all students by their preferred names or pronouns. Provide gender-neutral options for school supplies and activities.
2. Create a safe space: Ensure that the school environment is safe and welcoming for all students, regardless of their gender identity. This can be achieved by providing private spaces for students who may feel uncomfortable sharing bathrooms or locker rooms with students of other genders.
3. Provide support and resources: Offer support and resources specifically tailored to the needs of non-binary and gender-fluid students. This can include access to counseling services, peer support groups, and educational materials that address their unique experiences.
4. Encourage self-expression: Encourage students to express themselves through various means, such as art, music, or writing. This can help them develop their identity and build confidence in their expression.
5. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage non-binary and gender-fluid students to embrace challenges and view failures as opportunities for growth. This can help them develop resilience and perseverance, which are essential for academic success.
6. Involve parents and guardians: Keep parents and guardians informed about their child's educational experience and involve them in decision-making processes related to their child's education. This can help build a supportive network that can advocate for the student's needs.
7. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations that cater to the unique needs of non-binary and gender-fluid students, such as flexible seating arrangements or modifications to assignments and assessments.
8. Celebrate diversity: Organize events and activities that celebrate diversity and inclusivity in the school community. This can help create a culture of acceptance and respect for all students
