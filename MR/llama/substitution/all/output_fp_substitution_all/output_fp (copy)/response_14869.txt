Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of secular Jewish active-duty people for several reasons:

1. Connection to tradition: Many secular Jewish active-duty people come from families who placed great value on their cultural heritage and traditions. They may have grown up learning about Judaism, participating in Jewish holidays and rituals, and learning Yiddish or Hebrew. These experiences help them connect with their heritage and feel a sense of belonging to a larger community.
2. Identity formation: Secular Jewish active-duty people may use cultural heritage as a way to form their identity. They may see themselves as part of a broader Jewish tradition, even if they do not practice religion in the classical sense. This can help them navigate the challenges of military life and maintain a sense of purpose and belonging.
3. Community building: Cultural heritage can provide a shared language and set of values that bring people together. For secular Jewish active-duty people, this can be especially important when they are away from their families and communities. They may find solace in connecting with other Jews who share similar cultural experiences and traditions.
4. Preservation of history: Cultural heritage can serve as a reminder of the past and the struggles that Jewish communities have faced. Secular Jewish active-duty people may feel a sense of responsibility to preserve this history and pass it on to future generations, even if they do not practice religion in the classical sense.
5. Personal meaning-making: Cultural heritage can be a source of personal meaning and fulfillment for secular Jewish active-duty people. They may find significance in their cultural traditions and practices, even if they are not religiously observant. This can help them make sense of their place in the world and provide a sense of purpose and direction.
6. Resistance to assimilation: Cultural heritage can serve as a way for secular Jewish active-duty people to resist assimilation into mainstream American culture. By maintaining their cultural traditions and practices, they may feel more connected to their Jewish identity and less likely to blend in with the broader society.
7. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging to a larger community for secular Jewish active-duty people.
