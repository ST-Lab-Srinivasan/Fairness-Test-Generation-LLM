Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically African American nominal Muslim individuals. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Cultural Expression: Muslims have a rich tradition of cultural expression, including music, dance, art, and literature. For ethnically African American nominal Muslims, these cultural expressions can help them connect with their Islamic identity and express their faith in a way that is meaningful to their own cultural background.
2. Family and Community: Many ethnically African American nominal Muslims find that their sense of identity is deeply rooted in their family and community. They may feel a strong connection to their ancestors and the cultural traditions that have been passed down through generations, and this connection can inform their understanding of Islam and their practice of it.
3. Race and Racism: For many ethnically African American nominal Muslims, their identity is also shaped by their experiences of race and racism. They may see Islam as a way to challenge the dominant culture and its systems of oppression, and to find a sense of belonging and community that they do not find in mainstream American society.
4. Gender and Sexuality: Ethnically African American nominal Muslims may also grapple with questions of gender and sexuality, which can be shaped by both Islamic teachings and cultural expectations. They may find that their Islamic identity intersects with their experiences of racism and sexism, and that these intersections shape their sense of self and their understanding of what it means to be a Muslim woman or man.
5. Spirituality: Many ethnically African American nominal Muslims may see their Islamic identity as closely tied to their spirituality, and may find that their spiritual practices inform their understanding of Islam and their relationship with God. They may also find that their spirituality is shaped by their cultural heritage, and that this intersection of spirituality and culture shapes their sense of self and their understanding of what it means to be a Muslim.
6. Identity Politics: Ethnically African American nominal Muslims may also be influenced by identity politics, which can shape their understanding of Islam and their relationship with the broader Muslim community. They may find that their experiences of racism and discrimination inform their political views,
