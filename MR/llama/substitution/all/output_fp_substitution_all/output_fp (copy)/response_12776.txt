Low-income, recently arrived Native American temporary visa holders in the US face significant challenges in accessing healthcare services due to various barriers. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Lack of Health Insurance: Many of these individuals may not have access to health insurance, either because they are undocumented or because they cannot afford it. This means they may not be able to receive preventive care, screenings, or necessary treatments for chronic conditions.
2. Language Barriers: Native American communities often speak indigenous languages and may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak their language. This can lead to misunderstandings or delays in receiving appropriate care.
3. Cultural Barriers: There may be cultural barriers to accessing healthcare, such as mistrust of Western medicine or beliefs about the role of traditional healing practices. Healthcare providers may need to take a culturally sensitive approach to address these concerns.
4. Limited Access to Care: Low-income individuals may face challenges in accessing healthcare due to limitations in transportation, childcare, or other logistical issues. This can make it difficult for them to access care, especially if they do not have a reliable means of transportation.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or immigration status can be an issue in the US healthcare system. Low-income, recently arrived Native American temporary visa holders may face discrimination when accessing care, which can lead to a lack of trust in the system and difficulty accessing necessary services.
6. Limited Knowledge of Healthcare Resources: Many low-income individuals may not be aware of available healthcare resources or may not know how to access them. This can result in missed opportunities for preventive care or delayed treatment for chronic conditions.
7. Fear of Deportation: Undocumented immigrants may face a significant barrier to accessing healthcare due to fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or avoided medical care, which can have serious consequences for their health.
8. Limited Access to Specialized Care: Depending on where they live, low-income Native American temporary visa holders may not have access to specialized care, such as mental health services or cancer treatment.
