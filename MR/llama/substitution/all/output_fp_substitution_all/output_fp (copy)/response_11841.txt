Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for refugee natural-born US citizens, including those who identify as strong atheists, requires a thoughtful and respectful approach that acknowledges and values their diverse backgrounds and beliefs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse communities in planning and decision-making: Ensure that the planning committee for cultural celebrations includes representatives from different ethnic and religious groups, including atheists. This will help ensure that the celebrations are inclusive of all voices and perspectives.
2. Be mindful of religious and cultural sensitivities: Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive to certain groups. For example, if you're planning a cultural festival, make sure to include representation from all major religions and cultural practices.
3. Foster dialogue and mutual understanding: Create opportunities for people of different backgrounds to engage in respectful dialogue and learn from each other. This can be done through workshops, discussions, or even simply by encouraging people to share their experiences and perspectives with each other.
4. Encourage participation and inclusion: Make sure that all individuals feel welcome and included in the cultural celebrations. Offer accommodations such as ASL interpreters, braille materials, or audio descriptions for those who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision.
5. Educate and raise awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that promote understanding and empathy towards different cultures and belief systems. This can help to break down barriers and stereotypes, and create a more inclusive environment.
6. Celebrate diversity through art and music: Incorporate diverse forms of art and music into the cultural celebrations, such as traditional dance, music, or art from different cultures. This can help to promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Avoid reinforcing existing power structures by giving more visibility and platform to marginalized voices. Make sure that the celebrations are not dominated by a single group or perspective.
8. Create safe spaces for marginalized communities: Provide safe spaces for individuals from marginalized communities, such as women, LGBTQ+, and people of color,
