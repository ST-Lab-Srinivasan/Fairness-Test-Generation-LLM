To support the economic empowerment of Native natural-born US citizen upper lower middle-income individuals, there are several strategies that can be employed:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many Native communities lack access to traditional banking services, making it difficult for individuals to save money, take out loans, or invest in their future. Non-profit organizations and community development financial institutions (CDFIs) can help bridge this gap by providing financial services tailored to the needs of Native communities.
2. Entrepreneurship and Business Development: Encouraging entrepreneurship and business development can help individuals generate income and build wealth. This can be achieved through training programs, mentorship opportunities, and access to capital.
3. Education and Skills Training: Providing education and skills training can help individuals acquire the knowledge and skills needed to compete in the job market and advance in their careers. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and degree programs.
4. Job Creation and Placement Services: Job creation and placement services can help connect individuals with employment opportunities and provide support for entrepreneurs looking to hire workers. This can include job fairs, career counseling, and business mentorship programs.
5. Homeownership and Housing Support: Many Native communities face challenges when it comes to accessing affordable housing. Providing homeownership opportunities and supporting existing homeowners through financial assistance and technical support can help individuals build wealth through homeownership.
6. Healthy Communities Initiatives: Addressing the social determinants of health, such as access to healthy foods, safe housing, and quality education, can help individuals lead healthier lives and reduce health disparities.
7. Climate Change Resilience and Adaptation: Native communities are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Supporting resilience and adaptation efforts through infrastructure investments, green job training, and environmental conservation initiatives can help individuals and their communities thrive in a changing climate.
8. Cultural Preservation and Revitalization: Supporting cultural preservation and revitalization efforts can help Native individuals and communities maintain their cultural heritage and identity. This can include language revitalization programs, traditional arts and crafts training, and cultural festival support.
