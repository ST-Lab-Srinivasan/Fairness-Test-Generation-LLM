Creating more inclusive community programs for Nigerian individuals who have been married multiple times can be a challenging task, but there are several steps that can be taken to make these programs more welcoming and accessible. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the culture and values of the community: It is essential to understand the cultural and social norms of the community you are targeting.
