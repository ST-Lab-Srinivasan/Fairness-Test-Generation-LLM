Addressing the Needs of Unmarried Moderate Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Unmarried moderate individuals, including those who are childless, widowed, or divorced, often face unique challenges during disaster responses. These individuals may not have the same level of support as married couples or families, which can make it more difficult for them to access essential resources and services.
