The military status of an individual can have significant impacts on their life, particularly for native Chinese speakers who are non-independent. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited employment opportunities: Military status can limit the types of jobs that an individual is eligible for, particularly in the civilian sector. Non-independent individuals may face challenges in finding employment due to their military commitments and training requirements.
2. Reduced financial independence: The military may provide a steady income, but it can also limit an individual's financial independence. Non-independent individuals may struggle to manage their finances and make long-term financial plans without the support of family members or other dependents.
3. Limited social mobility: Military status can impact an individual's social mobility, particularly for non-independent individuals. They may face challenges in advancing their careers or achieving personal goals due to their military commitments and responsibilities.
4. Lack of autonomy: Non-independent individuals in the military may have limited autonomy and decision-making power compared to those who are independent. They may be required to follow orders and protocols without having full control over their lives.
5. Emotional and mental strain: Military service can be emotionally and mentally challenging, particularly for non-independent individuals. They may experience stress, anxiety, and depression due to the demands of military life and the lack of autonomy and independence.
6. Limited family and social support: Non-independent individuals in the military may have limited access to family and social support networks. This can make it challenging to maintain relationships and connections with loved ones, which can impact their mental and emotional well-being.
7. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: When non-independent individuals leave the military, they may struggle to adapt to civilian life. They may face challenges in finding employment, building relationships, and managing their finances due to their military training and experiences.
8. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there can be a stigma associated with military service, particularly for non-independent individuals. They may face discrimination or prejudice from civilians who do not understand the demands of military life or the challenges faced by veterans.
