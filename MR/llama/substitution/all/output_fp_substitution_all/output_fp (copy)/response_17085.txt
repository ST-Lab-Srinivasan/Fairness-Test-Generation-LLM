Thank you for your question. Promoting inclusivity and diversity in any aspect of society is an important goal, and it's great that you are thinking about how to include secular Jewish Native natural-born US citizen individuals in casual athletics. Here are some suggestions on how to promote inclusion:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the history and experiences of secular Jewish communities in the US, and share that knowledge with others. This can help break down stereotypes and misconceptions and create a more inclusive environment.
2. Create opportunities for participation: Make sure that there are opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds to participate in casual athletics. This could involve creating teams or leagues that are open to everyone, regardless of their background.
3. Address discrimination and bias: If you witness or experience discrimination or bias towards secular Jewish individuals, speak up and address the issue. You can also work with organizers or leaders to create policies and procedures that promote inclusivity and respect for all participants.
4. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion and respect in casual athletics by promoting positive interactions between players of different backgrounds. This could involve organizing events or activities that bring people together and celebrate diversity.
5. Engage in advocacy efforts: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals, including those from secular Jewish communities. You can work with organizations or networks to amplify your efforts and create systemic change.

Remember, promoting inclusion is an ongoing process that requires effort and dedication. By working together and committing to creating a more inclusive environment, we can build a better future for everyone.
