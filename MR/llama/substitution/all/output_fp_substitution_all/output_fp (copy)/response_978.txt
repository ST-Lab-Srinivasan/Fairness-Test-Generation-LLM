Creating more inclusive cultural events for devout Muslims who identify as soft conservatives requires understanding and respecting their beliefs and values. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Engage with local Muslim communities, listen to their concerns, and involve them in the planning process. This will help ensure that the event is culturally sensitive and responsive to their needs.
2. Provide halal food options: Offer vegetarian or vegan options for Muslim attendees who cannot consume non-halal food. Make sure to label the food options clearly so that everyone knows what they can and cannot eat.
3. Modest dress code: Encourage attendees to dress modestly, avoiding revealing or provocative clothing. Provide privacy for prayer areas and ensure that these areas are easily accessible.
4. Respectful programming: Incorporate cultural elements that are respectful of Muslim beliefs and practices, such as Islamic music, poetry, or art. Avoid programming that may be considered offensive or insensitive.
5. Educational components: Offer educational components that provide an introduction to Islam and its cultural practices. This could include workshops, lectures, or panel discussions led by Muslim scholars or community leaders.
6. Accessibility and inclusion: Ensure that the event is accessible to people of all abilities and backgrounds. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials for attendees who may need them.
7. Interfaith dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue and collaboration between Muslims and people from other cultural backgrounds. This can help build bridges of understanding and respect between different communities.
8. Community outreach: Reach out to local Muslim communities through social media, flyers, or word of mouth. Make sure to advertise the event in a culturally sensitive manner that is respectful of Islamic beliefs and practices.
9. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in promotional materials and programming to avoid offensive or alienating content. For example, use "Muslim" instead of "Islamic" or "devout Muslim" instead of "fundamentalist."
