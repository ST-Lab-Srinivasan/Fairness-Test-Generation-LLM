The impact of marital status on the lives of career-oriented, native Arabic speaker individuals with a genetic condition can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Individuals with a genetic condition may face social isolation due to stigma or discrimination, which can be exacerbated by their marital status. For example, if they are single or unmarried, they may face additional pressure to conform to societal norms around marriage and family.
