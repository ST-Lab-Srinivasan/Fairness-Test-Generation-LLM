To use data to highlight the issues faced by native Chinese and French speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Language proficiency assessments: Conduct language proficiency assessments for both native Chinese and French speakers to measure their proficiency in English. This could help identify areas where they struggle with the language and provide insights into the challenges they face.
2. Survey research: Develop surveys that target native Chinese and French speakers to gather data on their experiences learning English, including any challenges they encounter. You could ask questions about their background, motivation for learning English, and any difficulties they experience in terms of grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, etc.
3. Corpus analysis: Analyze large databases of texts (e.g., corpora) written by native Chinese and French speakers to identify patterns and trends in their language use. This could help you understand how they differ from native English speakers and what specific challenges they face when communicating in English.
4. Language use observations: Observe native Chinese and French speakers in real-life situations where they are using English, such as in workplaces or social settings. This could provide valuable insights into their language use and any challenges they encounter in different contexts.
5. Case studies: Conduct in-depth case studies of individual native Chinese and French speakers to gain a more detailed understanding of their language learning experiences and challenges. This could involve interviews, observations, and analysis of language samples.
6. Machine learning: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of language use by native Chinese and French speakers. This could help identify patterns and trends in their language use that may not be immediately apparent through other methods.
7. Multimodal analysis: Analyze data from multiple sources, such as speech, writing, and gestures, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the language use and challenges faced by native Chinese and French speakers.
8. Comparative analysis: Compare the language use and challenges faced by native Chinese and French speakers to those of native English speakers. This could help identify specific areas where they may struggle more than other groups.
9. Language teaching resources: Develop and evaluate language teaching resources tailored to the needs of native Chinese and French speakers, taking into account their unique language use
