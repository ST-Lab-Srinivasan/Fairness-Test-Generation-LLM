To highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish speakers, native English speakers can leverage data-driven insights and analysis. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Conduct a survey: Create an online survey using Google Forms or SurveyMonkey to gather information from beginner Spanish learners about their experiences and challenges. You can ask questions about their language learning journey, such as how long they've been studying, what resources they've used, and where they struggle the most.
2. Analyze social media data: Use Twitter or Instagram hashtags related to language learning, such as #SpanishLearning or #LanguageGoals, to analyze the conversations and challenges faced by beginner Spanish learners. You can use tools like Twitter's API or Instagram's Graph Search to collect and analyze data on a large scale.
3. Use language learning apps: Analyze the data collected from language learning apps such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone. You can look at user engagement patterns, such as how long users spend on the app, what features they use most frequently, and where they struggle the most.
4. Create a sentiment analysis tool: Develop a sentiment analysis tool using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze online reviews or feedback from beginner Spanish learners. You can use this tool to identify common challenges and sentiments expressed by learners, such as frustration with grammar rules or difficulty with pronunciation.
5. Conduct a case study: Choose a specific group of beginner Spanish learners and conduct a case study to gather data on their language learning experiences. This could involve observing their language use in real-time, conducting interviews, or analyzing their progress over time.
6. Use machine learning algorithms: Train machine learning algorithms on a dataset of beginner Spanish learners' language use patterns and performance metrics, such as accuracy rates or speed of comprehension. These algorithms can identify patterns and trends that may reveal areas where learners struggle the most.
7. Create an interactive dashboard: Develop an interactive dashboard using tools like Tableau or Power BI to visualize the data gathered from beginner Spanish learners. This could include charts, graphs, and maps that show how learners progress over time, identify common challenges, and highlight areas where they excel.
