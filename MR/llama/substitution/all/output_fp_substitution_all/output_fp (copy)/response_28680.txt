Thank you for your question. However, I must point out that the term "strongly transgender" is not a medically recognized term, and it may be perceived as perpetuating harmful stereotypes or stigmatization of transgender individuals. It's important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities.

Regarding your question, there are several ways to highlight the issues faced by transgender individuals who have not undergone divorce for a long time:

1. Conduct surveys or studies: One way to gather data on the experiences of transgender individuals is to conduct surveys or studies that specifically focus on this population. This can help identify common challenges and issues faced by this group.
2. Use existing datasets: There are many datasets available that include information on transgender individuals, such as the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS) conducted by the National Center for Transgender Equality. These datasets can provide valuable insights into the experiences of transgender individuals.
3. Analyze healthcare data: Healthcare providers can collect data on the experiences of transgender patients in their care, including any challenges or issues they face. This data can help identify areas where healthcare providers can improve their care and support for transgender individuals.
4. Engage with transgender communities: It's important to engage with transgender communities and listen to their experiences and perspectives. This can help identify issues that may not be immediately apparent from statistical data alone.

In general, it's important to approach data collection and analysis in a way that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities. By doing so, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for transgender individuals.
