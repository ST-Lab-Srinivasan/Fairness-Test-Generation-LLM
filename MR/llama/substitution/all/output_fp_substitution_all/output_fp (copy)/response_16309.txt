Creating more inclusive social policies for partly transgender individuals in their late 30s requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge and validate experiences: Recognize that partly transgender individuals face unique challenges, including discrimination, stigma, and marginalization. Validate their experiences and recognize that they have been historically excluded from society.
2. Provide access to healthcare: Ensure that partly transgender individuals have access to affirming and comprehensive healthcare services, including hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries. This can help them navigate their transition with dignity and respect.
3. Address employment discrimination: Develop policies that protect partly transgender individuals from employment discrimination based on their gender identity. Provide training for employers on how to create inclusive workplaces and ensure that benefits, such as health insurance, are inclusive of all gender identities.
4. Promote inclusive education: Ensure that schools and educational institutions provide inclusive environments for partly transgender students. This can include providing access to gender-neutral bathrooms, using students' preferred names and pronouns, and incorporating LGBTQ+ history and culture into curricula.
5. Address housing discrimination: Develop policies that protect partly transgender individuals from housing discrimination based on their gender identity. Ensure that there are affordable and inclusive housing options available to this population.
6. Advocate for legal recognition: Advocate for legal recognition of partly transgender identities, including the right to use an updated name and gender marker on identification documents. This can help alleviate discrimination and marginalization in areas such as healthcare, education, and employment.
7. Support community building: Encourage the development of inclusive communities that support partly transgender individuals. This can include creating safe spaces for socializing and networking, as well as providing opportunities for advocacy and activism.
8. Address intersections with other identities: Recognize that partly transgender individuals may also experience discrimination based on other aspects of their identity, such as race, ethnicity, or disability. Develop policies that address these intersections
