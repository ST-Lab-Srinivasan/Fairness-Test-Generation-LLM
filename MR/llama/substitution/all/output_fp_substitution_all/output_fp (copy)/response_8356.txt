Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and well-being of ethnically full Asian individuals, particularly those who are over 90 years old. Here are some ways mentorship can benefit this population:

1. Cultural preservation and transmission: Mentorship can help preserve and transmit cultural values, traditions, and practices within the Asian community. Elderly individuals can share their knowledge and experiences with younger generations, ensuring that cultural heritage is passed down accurately and intentionally.
2. Social connections and belonging: Social isolation can be a significant challenge for older adults, particularly those from minority groups. Mentorship can help establish social connections and a sense of belonging within the Asian community, reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation.
