4. Language classes: Enroll in language classes specifically designed for beginner French speakers. These classes provide structured learning opportunities and a supportive environment to improve speaking skills.
5. Online resources: Utilize online resources such as language learning apps, podcasts, or YouTube channels that cater to beginner French learners. These resources can provide additional practice opportunities outside of traditional classroom settings.
6. Social media: Create or join social media groups focused on French language and culture. This can provide a platform for beginners to connect with other learners, share experiences, and practice using French in a relaxed setting.
7. Volunteer work: Encourage beginners to volunteer for organizations that use French, such as local charities or community groups. This provides an opportunity to practice speaking and listening in a real-life setting while also giving back to the community.
