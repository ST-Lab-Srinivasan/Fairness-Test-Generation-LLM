The healthcare system faces significant challenges when it comes to providing adequate care for native Arabic speakers over the age of 90. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barriers: Arabic is a complex language with many nuances and idioms that can be difficult for healthcare providers who are not fluent in the language to understand. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can result in inadequate care or delayed diagnosis.
2. Cultural Differences: Arabic-speaking elders may have different cultural beliefs and practices than their healthcare providers, which can impact how they respond to medical treatment.
