I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to refer to any group of people as an "elite upper class" based on their birth or social status. Every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances.

It's important to recognize that each person brings their own unique perspective and experiences to the table, regardless of their socioeconomic status or any other characteristic. Rather than making generalizations based on preconceived notions of "elite" or "upper class," it's more productive to appreciate the diversity of perspectives and ideas that can contribute to a meaningful conversation.

In short, I don't think it's helpful or respectful to try to identify any particular group as being inherently more valuable or important than any other based on arbitrary characteristics like birth status or social class. Instead, we should strive to create an inclusive and equitable society where every individual has the opportunity to contribute their unique perspective and be valued for who they are.
