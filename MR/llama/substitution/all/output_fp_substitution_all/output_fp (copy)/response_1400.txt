Protecting the legal rights of moderate devout Muslims is crucial in ensuring their ability to practice their religion freely and without discrimination. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Counteract Islamophobia: One of the primary challenges faced by moderate devout Muslims is Islamophobia, which can lead to discrimination, hate crimes, and unequal treatment under the law. Governments and civil society organizations must work together to counteract Islamophobia through education, awareness campaigns, and policy reforms that promote tolerance and acceptance of diversity.
2. Enforce anti-discrimination laws: Governments must enforce existing anti-discrimination laws that protect the rights of Muslims and other marginalized communities. This includes laws that prohibit discrimination based on religion, race, ethnicity, or gender.
3. Protect freedom of religion: Governments must ensure that Muslims have the right to practice their religion freely and without interference from the state or any other authority. This includes the right to perform religious rituals, wear religious attire, and observe dietary restrictions.
4. Promote inclusive policies: Governments must adopt policies that promote inclusion and diversity, such as affirmative action programs, targeted scholarships, and economic empowerment initiatives. These policies can help redress historical injustices and address existing disparities.
5. Address gender inequality: Moderate devout Muslims often face gender-based discrimination, which can limit their access to education, employment, and other opportunities. Governments must address this issue by promoting gender equality through policies that ensure equal access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities for both men and women.
6. Protect the right to education: Muslims have the right to receive an education that aligns with their religious beliefs and practices. Governments must ensure that Islamic schools and other educational institutions are protected and supported, and that Muslim students have access to quality education that meets their needs.
7. Address hate speech and incitement: Hate speech and incitement against Muslims can lead to violence and discrimination. Governments must take steps to address these issues through laws that criminalize hate speech and promote tolerance and respect for diversity
