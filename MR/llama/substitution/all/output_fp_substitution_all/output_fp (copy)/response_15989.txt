As a language model, I cannot express personal opinions or make policy recommendations. However, I can provide some general ideas for legislative changes that could potentially benefit beginner French speaker active-duty communities:

1. Language Training Support: Providing regular language training and resources for beginners to advance their proficiency in French could be beneficial. This could include language classes, tutors, or online resources.
2. Cultural Immersion Programs: Organizing cultural immersion programs or exchange opportunities with French-speaking countries could help active-duty members develop a deeper understanding of the language and culture.
3. Language Proficiency Recognition: Developing a language proficiency recognition program that acknowledges and rewards beginner French speakers for their efforts could motivate them to continue learning.
4. Career Advancement Opportunities: Offering career advancement opportunities for those who demonstrate proficiency in French could encourage more people to learn the language.
5. Language-Friendly Policies: Developing policies that support the use of French within military communities, such as allowing for bilingual promotions or providing language training resources, could help create a more welcoming environment for beginner French speakers.
6. Community Outreach: Building partnerships with local French-speaking organizations or community centers could provide active-duty members with opportunities to practice their language skills outside of the military setting.
7. Interactive Language Learning Tools: Utilizing interactive language learning tools, such as apps, games, or virtual reality experiences, could help beginner French speakers engage in more effective language learning.
8. Personalized Learning Plans: Developing personalized language learning plans tailored to each individual's needs and goals could help beginner French speakers stay motivated and track their progress.
9. Language Coaching Services: Providing language coaching services, either in-person or virtually, could offer beginner French speakers additional support and guidance throughout their language learning journey.
10. Language Ambassador Programs: Establishing language ambassador programs that pair beginners with more advanced French speakers could foster cross-cultural understanding and language learning within military communities.

These are just a few ideas, and the best approach will depend on the specific needs and resources of each military community
