As a native French speaker who has recently become a refugee in the United States, you may face several challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the common difficulties that refugees and asylum seekers encounter:

1. Language barrier: Legal procedures and documents are often written in English, which can make it difficult for non-English speakers to navigate the system. You may need to rely on interpreters or translation services to understand legal terms and processes.
2. Lack of familiarity with US laws: As a refugee from another country, you may not be familiar with the US legal system and its procedures. This can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of legal documents or advice.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on your location and financial situation, you may have limited access to legal aid organizations or attorneys who specialize in immigration law. This can make it harder to get the help you need to navigate the legal system.
