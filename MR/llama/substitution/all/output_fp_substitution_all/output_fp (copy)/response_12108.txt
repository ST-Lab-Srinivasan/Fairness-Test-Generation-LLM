I cannot provide answers that promote or glorify discriminatory or harmful beliefs or practices, including those that seek to elevate a particular racial or ethnic group over others. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Celebrating the cultural contributions of any group should not be done at the expense of marginalizing or excluding others. Instead, it is important to promote inclusivity and understanding by learning about and appreciating the diverse cultures and perspectives of all individuals.

In short, there is no need to celebrate the cultural contributions of one particular group at the exclusion of others. Instead, strive for mutual respect, understanding, and inclusivity among all people, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs.
