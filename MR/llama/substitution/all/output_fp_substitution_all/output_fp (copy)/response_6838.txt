As a Nigerian French speaker, I can provide some insights on the challenges faced by native French speakers in the Nigerian healthcare system. However, it is important to note that these challenges may vary depending on individual experiences and locations within Nigeria.

1. Language barriers: One of the primary challenges faced by native French speakers in Nigeria is the language barrier. While French is an official language in Nigeria, English is widely spoken, and many healthcare providers may not speak French fluently. This can make it difficult for patients to communicate their symptoms or concerns effectively, leading to misdiagnosis or delayed treatment.
