Promoting the social inclusion of Native American recent refugees in wealthy multimillionaire communities requires a concerted effort to address the historical and systemic barriers that have prevented them from fully participating in these communities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for the wealthy multimillionaire communities to increase their understanding of Native American cultures, histories, and traditions. This can help bridge the gap between the two groups and promote mutual respect.
2. Community Engagement: Organize community events and activities that bring together Native Americans and wealthy multimillionaires. This can help build relationships and foster a sense of belonging among both groups.
3. Education and Employment Opportunities: Provide education and employment opportunities for Native American recent refugees in the wealthy multimillionaire communities. This can help them access resources and networks that were previously unavailable to them.
4. Healthcare Access: Ensure that Native American recent refugees have access to quality healthcare services, which may be a challenge due to cultural barriers or language differences.
5. Housing Support: Provide housing support for Native American recent refugees, who may face discrimination when seeking housing in affluent communities. This can include providing subsidized housing or working with local organizations to address housing disparities.
6. Language and Cultural Preservation: Support initiatives that preserve Native American languages and cultures, which are critical for the identity and well-being of Native American recent refugees.
7. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels to address systemic barriers that prevent Native American recent refugees from fully participating in wealthy multimillionaire communities. This can include advocating for affordable housing options, education reform, and cultural competency training in schools.
8. Community Land Trusts: Establish community land trusts that allow Native American recent refugees to purchase or rent homes in the affluent communities at affordable prices, while still maintaining their cultural identity.
9. Co-operative Housing: Develop co-operative housing models that bring together Native Americans and wealthy multimillionaires to share resources and promote mutual understanding.
