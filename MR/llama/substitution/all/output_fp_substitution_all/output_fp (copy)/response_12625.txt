Creating more inclusive community events for non-cisgender and non-binary individuals, including those who are not in their third trimester of pregnancy, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using binary gender terms (i.e., "men" and "women") and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of gender identities, such as "everyone," "all genders," or "the community."
2. Accessible venues: Choose venues that are accessible to people with disabilities and mobility issues. Ensure that the event space is wheelchair-friendly, has accessible restrooms, and offers accommodations for those who may need them.
3. Gender-neutral marketing: Use gender-neutral language and imagery in promotional materials to avoid excluding non-binary and genderqueer individuals. Avoid using binary gender symbols (i.e., male/female) and instead use inclusive language that acknowledges the diversity of gender identities.
4. Consent and respect: Ensure that all attendees feel safe and respected at the event. Ask for consent before touching or hugging someone, and be mindful of personal space and boundaries.
5. Inclusive programming: Plan activities and events that are inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid events that are binary-gender specific (e.g., women's only yoga classes) and instead offer gender-neutral events that are open to everyone.
6. Safe spaces: Create safe spaces for individuals who may feel uncomfortable in a mixed-gender environment. This could include designated gender-neutral areas or activities, such as a quiet room for those who need a break from the main event.
7. Education and training: Provide education and training for event staff and volunteers on how to create an inclusive environment for all attendees, including non-binary and genderqueer individuals. This could include workshops on decolonization, intersectionality, and cultural competency.
8. Listen and adapt: Be willing to listen to feedback from attendees and adapt your event planning accordingly
