As an AI language model, I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or marginalization towards individuals with known or unknown genetic conditions. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

Instead of focusing on promoting the artistic expression of "ultra-independent individuals," it's important to recognize and value the unique contributions and perspectives of all individuals, including those with genetic conditions. Here are some ways to promote inclusivity and accessibility in the arts:

1. Provide opportunities for diverse voices: Ensure that there are platforms and spaces available for individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those with disabilities, to express themselves through art. This can include exhibitions, performances, or workshops.
2. Offer adaptive tools and resources: Provide adaptive tools and resources, such as assistive technology or accessible materials, to ensure that all individuals can participate in the creative process.
3. Foster inclusive communities: Encourage collaborations between artists with different backgrounds and abilities to foster a sense of community and inclusivity. This can help break down barriers and promote mutual understanding and respect.
4. Challenge ableism: Ableism is the discrimination or marginalization of individuals based on their abilities or disabilities. Challenge ableist attitudes and practices in the arts by promoting diversity, accessibility, and inclusivity.
5. Celebrate differences: Embrace the unique perspectives and talents of individuals with genetic conditions or other abilities. Highlight and celebrate these differences to promote a culture of inclusion and respect.
6. Advocate for accessibility: Work towards making arts spaces and events accessible to all, including individuals with mobility, sensory, or cognitive impairments. This can involve implementing practical solutions such as wheelchair ramps, audio descriptions, or braille signage.
7. Provide education and training: Offer educational resources and training programs for artists and arts professionals to learn about inclusivity, accessibility, and the unique needs of individuals with genetic conditions.
8. Encourage intersectional advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and accessibility across different marginalized groups,
