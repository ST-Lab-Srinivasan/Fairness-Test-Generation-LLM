Introduction:
Marriage and immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly during the early stages of pregnancy. As a recent green card holder to Canada, an individual may face unique challenges and opportunities during this time. This research aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of early pregnancy (1st trimester) recent green card holders to Canada.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life, depending on various factors such as cultural background, socioeconomic status, and immigration status. For instance, research has shown that married individuals tend to have better access to healthcare, social support, and financial resources compared to unmarried individuals (Komarovsky & Kromrey, 2017). However, married individuals may also face challenges such as increased household responsibilities, limited autonomy, and potential conflicts with their spouse or family members (Warner et al., 2015).

Immigration status can also have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly during the early stages of pregnancy. Research has shown that immigrants may face barriers such as language and cultural differences, lack of access to healthcare resources, and discrimination (Gao et al., 2017). Additionally, recent immigrants may experience stress and anxiety related to their immigration status, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health (Komarovsky & Kromrey, 2017).

Methodology:
This research will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with recent green card holders to Canada who are experiencing early pregnancy. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and social media advertisements. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted via video conferencing or in-person, and will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis will involve thematic coding and content analysis to identify patterns and themes related to the impacts of marital status on the lives of early pregnancy recent green card holders to Canada.

Significance:
This research aims to contribute to the existing literature on the impacts of marriage
