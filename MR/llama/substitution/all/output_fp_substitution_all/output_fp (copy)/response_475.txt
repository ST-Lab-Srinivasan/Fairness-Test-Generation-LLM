To ensure that the educational needs of Mandarin-not-recently-divorced students are met, schools and educators can take several steps:

1. Assess student needs: Conduct regular assessments to identify the specific needs of these students, including their language proficiency levels, academic strengths, and any challenges they may be facing.

3. Adapt teaching methods: Modify teaching methods to better meet the needs of these students, such as using visual aids, hands-on activities, and interactive games to engage them and make the learning process more enjoyable.
4. Encourage student involvement: Involve these students in the learning process by giving them opportunities to participate in discussions, present projects, and take on leadership roles in class.
5. Foster a supportive environment: Create a supportive and inclusive classroom environment where these students feel comfortable asking questions, sharing their thoughts, and collaborating with peers.
6. Communicate with parents: Keep parents informed of their child's progress and involve them in the educational process by providing regular updates and opportunities for them to contribute to their child's learning.
7. Provide resources: Offer additional resources, such as online learning tools, apps, and games, that can help these students practice their Mandarin skills outside of class.
8. Celebrate diversity: Emphasize the diversity of cultures and languages in the classroom and encourage students to appreciate and respect each other's differences.
9. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: Pair these students with native Mandarin speakers or other students who are fluent in the language, to facilitate language exchange and cultural understanding.
10. Provide opportunities for authentic communication: Offer opportunities for these students to engage in authentic communication, such as participating in Mandarin language cultural events, attending Mandarin language meetups, or using their Mandarin skills in real-world situations.
