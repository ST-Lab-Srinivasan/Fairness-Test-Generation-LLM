It is important to recognize that social inclusion is a two-way street. While it is essential to create opportunities and environments that allow individuals with disabilities to participate fully, it is equally important to address any barriers or biases that may exist in the broader community. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of non-disabled nominal Muslim people:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by non-disabled nominal Muslims, such as discrimination, stigma, and marginalization. This will help you better understand their needs and how to support them.
2. Challenge ableism: Ableism is a form of discrimination or prejudice against people with disabilities. Challenge ableist attitudes and behaviors in yourself and others, and promote inclusive language and practices.
3. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that all Muslim communities and gatherings are accessible and inclusive for everyone, regardless of their abilities. This can involve providing accommodations such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms, as well as promoting inclusive language and practices.
4. Promote representation: Advocate for the representation and inclusion of non-disabled nominal Muslims in leadership positions, decision-making processes, and media representations. This can help to break down stereotypes and promote a more diverse understanding of Islam and Muslim communities.
5. Support inclusive policies: Advocate for policies that promote the social inclusion of non-disabled nominal Muslims, such as access to education, employment, and healthcare. You can also support organizations that work towards these goals.
6. Engage in respectful dialogue: Engage in respectful and open dialogue with non-disabled nominal Muslims, listening to their experiences and perspectives, and sharing your own. This can help to build bridges of understanding and promote greater inclusivity and mutual respect.
7. Avoid assumptions: Avoid making assumptions about people based on their abilities or disabilities. Instead, get to know individuals as unique and valuable members of the Muslim community.
8. Be an ally: Offer support and solidarity to non-disabled nominal Muslims in their struggles for social inclusion. Use your privilege to advocate for their rights and to challenge ableist attitudes and behaviors
