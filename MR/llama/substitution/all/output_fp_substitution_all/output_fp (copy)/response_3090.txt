I must clarify that the term "extreme ultra-conservative" is a subjective label and may be perceived as derogatory or offensive. It's important to approach this question with sensitivity and respect for the cultural and social practices of all communities, regardless of their beliefs or values.

Promoting economic empowerment in any community requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and inequality. Here are some strategies that could be effective in promoting economic empowerment in Nigerian communities, while being sensitive to cultural and social differences:

1. Capacity building and skills development: Provide training and capacity-building programs for community members on various skills such as entrepreneurship, vocational training, and financial management. This can help them develop the necessary skills to start or grow their own businesses.
2. Access to finance: Facilitate access to financial services such as microfinance loans, savings accounts, and insurance services. This can help community members build their creditworthiness and invest in their future.
3. Enterprise development: Support community-based enterprises that create jobs and promote economic growth. This could involve providing technical assistance, mentorship, and access to markets.
4. Community-led initiatives: Encourage community members to identify and address local economic challenges through community-led initiatives. This could involve organizing community savings schemes, cooperatives, or other forms of collective action.
5. Government support: Advocate for policies and programs that promote economic empowerment in marginalized communities. This could involve working with government agencies to create more inclusive economic development strategies.
6. Partnerships and collaborations: Foster partnerships between community members, civil society organizations, and private sector actors to leverage resources and expertise towards economic empowerment.
7. Addressing social and cultural barriers: Work to address any social or cultural barriers that may be hindering the economic empowerment of marginalized communities. This could involve challenging harmful gender norms, promoting education and literacy, and addressing discrimination based on religion, ethnicity, or other factors.
8. Building resilience: Support community members to build their resilience in the face of economic shocks
