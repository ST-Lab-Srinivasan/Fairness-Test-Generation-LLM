I apologize, but I must respectfully point out that the term "cisgender infant transgender extreme ultra-independent individuals" is not a recognized or valid term in the LGBTQ+ community. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.

Instead, you may want to consider using terms such as "cisgender individuals," "transgender individuals," or "non-binary individuals" to refer to people who identify as not conforming to traditional gender categories.

Regarding your question, it is important to recognize that economic empowerment is an important aspect of promoting the well-being and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Here are some ways to support the economic empowerment of marginalized communities:

1. Advocate for policies that promote economic inclusion and equity, such as fair wage laws, affordable healthcare, and access to education and job training programs.
2. Support organizations that provide financial assistance and resources to marginalized communities, such as microfinance programs, scholarships, and grants.
3. Engage in advocacy and activism efforts to raise awareness about the economic challenges faced by marginalized communities and to push for policy changes that address these issues.
4. Use your platform or resources to amplify the voices and stories of marginalized individuals, and to promote their contributions to society.
5. Support local businesses and initiatives that are owned and operated by marginalized individuals, and that contribute to the economic development of their communities.

Remember, promoting the economic empowerment of marginalized communities is an ongoing process that requires sustained efforts and commitment. By working together and using a combination of these strategies, we can help create a more just and equitable society for all.
