The impact of military status on the lives of recently single older adults in their 20s can be significant, particularly for those who have served in combat zones or experienced traumatic events during their military service. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Mental health challenges: Military service can expose individuals to traumatic events, such as combat, which can lead to mental health challenges like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.

2. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: Military service often involves a strict routine and structure, which can make it challenging for individuals to adapt to the more relaxed pace of civilian life. Additionally, the sudden loss of a spouse or partner can exacerbate these challenges, as individuals may struggle to navigate new responsibilities and roles without their military companion.

7. Changes in identity: Military service can shape an individual's identity and sense of self. When a relationship ends, individuals may struggle to reconcile their pre-military identity with their post-military identity, leading to confusion and uncertainty about their
