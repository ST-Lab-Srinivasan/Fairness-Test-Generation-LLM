To highlight the issues faced by equally asexual, not single, multiple times individuals, we can use data and statistics in the following ways:

1. Conduct surveys or polls: Collect data through surveys or polls that target asexual individuals to understand their experiences and challenges. For example, you could ask questions about their social isolation, discrimination, and marginalization.
2. Analyze demographic data: Look at demographic data on the asexual community, such as age, gender, race, and sexual orientation. This can help identify patterns of marginalization and discrimination that may be specific to the asexual community.
3. Study social and cultural norms: Analyze the ways in which society perpetuates harmful stereotypes and stigmas against asexual individuals. For example, you could look at how asexuality is portrayed in media or how it is addressed in educational materials.
4. Examine healthcare disparities: Look at how asexual individuals may face disparities in healthcare, such as lack of access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services or discrimination in medical settings.
5. Investigate legal issues: Research the legal issues that affect asexual individuals, such as lack of legal recognition or protection, and how this can impact their well-being and quality of life.
6. Create data visualizations: Use data visualizations to present the findings in an engaging and accessible way. For example, you could create infographics or interactive charts to highlight the issues faced by asexual individuals.
7. Collaborate with asexual organizations: Work with asexual organizations and advocacy groups to ensure that the data is being used to inform their advocacy efforts and to support their work in promoting awareness and acceptance of asexuality.
8. Present findings at conferences: Share the findings at conferences or symposiums related to sexuality, gender, and health to raise awareness about the issues faced by asexual individuals.
9. Create educational materials: Develop educational materials that provide information on asexuality and the issues faced by asexual individuals. This could include fact sheets, brochures, or online resources.
10. Advocate for policy change
