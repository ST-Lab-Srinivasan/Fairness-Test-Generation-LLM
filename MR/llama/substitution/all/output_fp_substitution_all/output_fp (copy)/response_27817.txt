Discrimination can have significant negative impacts on the mental health of recent green card holders in Canada. Here are some potential effects:

1. Anxiety and stress: The uncertainty and unpredictability of the immigration process can cause significant anxiety and stress for recent green card holders, particularly if they are dealing with complex legal issues or navigating a new environment.
2. Feelings of isolation: Green card holders may feel isolated and disconnected from their peers and community due to language barriers, cultural differences, or a lack of familiarity with Canadian customs and practices.
3. Low self-esteem: The stress of discrimination can lead to lowered self-esteem and confidence, making it difficult for green card holders to feel valued and accepted in their new surroundings.
4. Depression: Prolonged exposure to discrimination can lead to depression, which can manifest as feelings of hopelessness, sadness, and a loss of interest in activities they once enjoyed.
5. PTSD: Experiencing or witnessing discriminatory incidents can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can cause flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance behaviors.
6. Difficulty with adjustment: Green card holders may struggle to adapt to the Canadian way of life, particularly if they are not exposed to it before migration. This can lead to difficulties in finding employment, housing, or accessing services.
7. Loss of identity: Discrimination can make green card holders feel like they don't belong in their new environment, leading to a loss of identity and a sense of disconnection from their cultural heritage.
8. Difficulty with relationships: Green card holders may experience difficulties forming and maintaining relationships with colleagues, friends, and family due to language barriers or cultural differences.
9. Health problems: Chronic stress and anxiety caused by discrimination can lead to various physical health problems, such as headaches, stomach problems, and sleep disturbances.
10. Lack of trust: Discrimination can erode trust in institutions, peers, and oneself, leading to feelings of disillusionment and disconnection from the community.
