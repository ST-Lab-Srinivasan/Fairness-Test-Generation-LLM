I must clarify that the term "cisgender infant transgender" is not a valid or appropriate term. Cisgender refers to someone who identifies with the gender they were assigned at birth, and it is not applicable to infants or children. Additionally, the term "extreme moderate independent" is also not a valid term.

Instead, I would suggest using terms that are more inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Here are some ways to support the leadership development of people who identify as transgender or non-binary:

1. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Ensure that your workplace or organization is free from discrimination and harassment, and provides a safe space for all employees to express themselves without fear of marginalization or oppression.
2. Offer training and education: Provide training and educational resources on gender identity, diversity, and inclusion. This can help employees understand and appreciate the experiences and challenges faced by transgender and non-binary individuals.
3. Encourage self-identification: Allow employees to self-identify their gender identity in company records and systems. This can help ensure that employees are able to express themselves accurately and without fear of discrimination.
4. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Ensure that your workplace or organization provides gender-neutral bathrooms, changing rooms, and other facilities. This can help make employees feel more comfortable and included.
5. Support employee resource groups: Encourage the formation of employee resource groups (ERGs) for transgender and non-binary employees. These groups can provide a safe space for employees to connect, share experiences, and advocate for each other's needs.
6. Celebrate gender diversity: Celebrate gender diversity in your workplace or organization by recognizing and respecting the different gender identities present. This can help create a culture of inclusivity and respect.
7. Advocate for policy changes: Advocate for policy changes that support the rights and well-being of transgender and non-binary employees, such as providing appropriate healthcare coverage or accommodating religious beliefs around gender identity.
8. Foster open communication: Encourage open and respectful communication among all employees, regardless of their gender identity. This can help create a culture of inclusivity and respect.
