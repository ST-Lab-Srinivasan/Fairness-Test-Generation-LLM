Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. When an early pregnancy (within the first trimester) occurs, it can add an extra layer of complexity to the situation. The marital status of the individual can play a crucial role in shaping their experience during this time. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of early pregnancy native English speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, and financial stability. For example, married individuals tend to have better mental health outcomes than unmarried individuals, possibly due to the emotional support and stability provided by a spouse (Koenig et al., 2014). Similarly, unmarried individuals may experience higher levels of stress and anxiety during pregnancy due to the lack of social support and financial instability (Caughey et al., 2013).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of early pregnancy native English speaker individuals, including both married and unmarried individuals. The survey will collect demographic information, as well as questions related to the impact of marital status on their experience during the first trimester of pregnancy. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gain a more nuanced understanding of their experiences.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the existing literature on the impact of marital status on reproductive health outcomes. By examining the experiences of early pregnancy native English speaker individuals, this study can provide valuable insights into how marital status influences their lives during this critical period. The findings of this study can inform healthcare providers and policymakers in their efforts to improve reproductive health outcomes for marginalized populations.

Timeline:
This study will be completed within 12 months, with the following timeline:

* Months 1-3: Literature review and survey questionnaire development
* Months 4-6: Data collection (
