Promoting the social inclusion of Native American communities, particularly those that are lower-class or marginalized, is crucial for addressing the historical and systemic inequalities they have faced. Here are some strategies that can help promote their social inclusion:

1. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that raise awareness about the history and culture of Native American communities. This can help bridge the knowledge gap between different communities and foster empathy and understanding.
2. Community development: Invest in community development projects that promote economic growth and job creation in Native American communities. This can help reduce poverty and improve living standards, which are often lower compared to other communities in the US.
