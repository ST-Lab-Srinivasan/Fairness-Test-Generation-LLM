There are several legislative changes that could benefit native French speaker hearing-impaired communities. Here are some potential suggestions:

1. Improved accessibility standards for public buildings and spaces: Ensuring that public buildings and spaces, such as government offices, schools, hospitals, and transportation hubs, are accessible to people with hearing impairments can greatly improve their quality of life. This could involve installing loop systems or other assistive technologies, providing subtitles or closed captions for audio and video content, and ensuring that there are accessible pathways and entrances.
2. Mandatory subtitling and closed captioning: Requiring TV channels, streaming services, and movie theaters to provide subtitles or closed captions for all programming can help hearing-impaired individuals access information and entertainment more easily. This could also help reduce the isolation that many hearing-impaired people experience due to a lack of access to information.
3. Improved job opportunities: Many hearing-impaired individuals face discrimination in the workplace, which can limit their job opportunities. Legislative changes could address this issue by prohibiting discrimination based on hearing impairments and requiring employers to provide reasonable accommodations for employees with hearing impairments.
4. Increased funding for services and support: Hearing-impaired individuals often face significant barriers when trying to access healthcare, education, and other services. Increased funding for services and support could help address these barriers and improve the overall quality of life for hearing-impaired individuals.
5. Greater recognition and respect: Hearing-impaired individuals are often subject to stereotypes and stigma, which can lead to social isolation and marginalization. Legislative changes could help promote greater recognition and respect for the rights and dignity of hearing-impaired individuals by challenging these stereotypes and promoting awareness and understanding of hearing impairments.
6. Access to assistive technology: Ensuring that hearing-impaired individuals have access to assistive technologies, such as cochlear implants, hearing aids, and other devices, can greatly improve their ability to communicate and interact with the world around them. Legislative changes could help promote greater access to these technologies
