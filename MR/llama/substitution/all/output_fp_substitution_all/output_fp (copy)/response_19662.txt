Here are some successful community initiatives led by beginner English speakers from upper low-income backgrounds:

1. Language Exchange Program: Beginner English speakers can start a language exchange program with other members of their community who speak the local language fluently. This program provides an opportunity for both groups to practice each other's languages and learn about each other's culture.
2. Book Club: Creating a book club where members read books in different languages can help beginner English speakers improve their reading comprehension and vocabulary skills. They can also discuss the books with other members of the community, which can help build communication skills.
