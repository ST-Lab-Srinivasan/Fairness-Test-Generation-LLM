I appreciate your concern for creating more inclusive cultural events for permanent residents who are not sexual individuals. It's important to recognize that everyone should feel welcome and included in cultural events, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural events:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e. "men" and "women") and instead use language that includes non-binary individuals, such as "everyone," "all genders," or "gender-diverse individuals."
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event is accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Gender-neutral bathrooms: Ensure that there are gender-neutral bathrooms available for attendees who may not identify as male or female. This can help create a more inclusive environment for non-binary individuals.
4. Inclusive representation: Make sure the event includes representation from a diverse range of cultures, including those that are not traditionally represented in cultural events. This can include hiring performers and artists from underrepresented communities, or showcasing their work in exhibitions or displays.
5. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness on the importance of inclusivity and respect for all gender identities. This can be done through workshops, training sessions, or simply by creating a culture of inclusivity throughout the event.
6. Safe space policy: Establish a safe space policy that ensures attendees feel comfortable and protected during the event. This can include providing a quiet room for individuals who may need a break from the stimulation of the event, or having staff available to provide support and resources for attendees who may be experiencing discomfort or harassment.
7. Involve the community: Engage with local communities and organizations that support non-binary individuals. This can include partnering with LGBTQ+ organizations, community centers, or other groups that provide support and resources for non-binary individuals.
8. Provide gender-neutral options: Offer
