Promoting the artistic expression of mixed African-American long-term recently immigrant individuals requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach that values their unique experiences, perspectives, and cultural backgrounds. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Create safe spaces for self-expression: Provide opportunities for these individuals to share their stories, experiences, and creative expressions through various mediums such as writing, poetry, music, dance, or visual arts. These spaces can be physical or virtual, and should be designed to foster trust, mutual respect, and a sense of belonging.
2. Celebrate cultural diversity: Host events that showcase the artistic expressions of mixed African-American long-term recently immigrant individuals, highlighting their diverse cultural backgrounds and experiences. These events can include art exhibitions, performances, poetry readings, or musical concerts.
3. Offer training and resources: Provide access to training, workshops, and resources that can help these individuals develop their artistic skills and knowledge. This can include classes on various art forms, mentorship opportunities with experienced artists, and access to professional equipment and software.
4. Encourage collaboration: Pair mixed African-American long-term recently immigrant individuals with established artists, writers, or musicians from diverse backgrounds. This can foster cross-cultural exchange, learning, and mutual appreciation, leading to the creation of innovative and dynamic art forms.
5. Create a platform for visibility: Develop an online platform or physical space that showcases the artistic expressions of mixed African-American long-term recently immigrant individuals. This can help increase their visibility, provide exposure to a broader audience, and encourage more opportunities for collaboration and growth.
6. Address cultural barriers: Recognize that cultural barriers may exist between these individuals and the mainstream art world. Work to address these barriers by providing culturally sensitive training, language support, and other resources that can help bridge the gap.
7. Foster community engagement: Encourage mixed African-American long-term recently immigrant individuals to engage with their local communities through art-based initiatives. This can help build bridges between different cultures, foster cross-cultural understanding, and promote social cohesion.
