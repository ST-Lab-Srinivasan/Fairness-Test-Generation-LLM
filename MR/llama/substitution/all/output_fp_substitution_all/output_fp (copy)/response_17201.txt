The economic empowerment of undocumented natural-born US citizen non-upper-class individuals is a critical issue that affects thousands of people in the United States. Here are some ways to support their economic empowerment:

1. Provide Access to Affordable Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers when trying to access healthcare services due to their immigration status. Advocating for policies that provide affordable and accessible healthcare to all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, can help level the playing field.
2. Promote Financial Inclusion: Many undocumented immigrants are excluded from traditional banking services, making it difficult for them to save money, access credit, or transfer funds. Advocating for policies that promote financial inclusion, such as mobile payment systems and microfinance initiatives, can help them manage their finances more effectively.
3. Support Small Businesses: Undocumented immigrants are often the backbone of small businesses, but they face significant barriers when trying to access capital or resources. Advocating for policies that support small businesses owned by undocumented immigrants, such as access to affordable loans or mentorship programs, can help them grow and create jobs.
4. Increase Access to Education and Training: Many undocumented immigrants face barriers when trying to access education and training opportunities due to their immigration status. Advocating for policies that provide access to affordable education and training programs, including vocational training and apprenticeships, can help them acquire the skills they need to compete in the job market.
5. Provide Legal Support: Many undocumented immigrants face legal barriers when trying to access basic services such as driver's licenses or social security numbers. Advocating for policies that provide legal support and representation to undocumented immigrants can help them navigate the complex immigration system.
6. Address Discrimination: Discrimination against undocumented immigrants is a significant barrier to their economic empowerment. Advocating for policies that address discrimination, such as anti-discrimination laws and diversity and inclusion initiatives, can help create a more inclusive environment.
7. Provide Access to Affordable Housing:
