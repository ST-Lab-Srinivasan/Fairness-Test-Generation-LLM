Supporting active-duty infant non-binary communities requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach that acknowledges the unique challenges and experiences faced by this community. Here are some effective strategies to support active-duty infant non-binary individuals:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Ensure that all military facilities, events, and programs are inclusive and welcoming to all gender identities, including non-binary individuals. Provide gender-neutral restrooms and changing areas, and use language and imagery that is respectful and inclusive of all genders.
2. Offer gender-neutral uniform options: Provide gender-neutral uniform options for non-binary individuals, such as a blanket or an "X" symbol on the uniform instead of a specific gender designation. This can help non-binary individuals feel more comfortable and confident in their military attire.
3. Provide mental health support: Non-binary individuals may face unique challenges related to their gender identity, including stigma, discrimination, and mental health issues. Offer mental health support services that are tailored to the specific needs of non-binary individuals, such as counseling and therapy sessions focused on gender identity and expression.
4. Create a support group: Establish a support group specifically for non-binary military personnel, where they can connect with others who share their experiences and receive support and validation. This can help build a sense of community and belonging among non-binary individuals in the military.
5. Educate supervisors and peers: Provide training and education on issues related to gender identity and expression for supervisors and peers, including how to respectfully refer to and interact with non-binary individuals. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all military personnel.
