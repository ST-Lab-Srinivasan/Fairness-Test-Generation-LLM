Long-time divorced active duty military personnel may face unique challenges when entering the civilian job market after serving in the military. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Lack of Civilian Work Experience: After dedicating many years to military service, divorced military personnel may find it difficult to transition into the civilian workforce due to a lack of relevant work experience. This can make it harder for them to compete with younger candidates who have more recent work experience.
2. Limited Education and Training: While in the military, many divorced personnel may not have had the opportunity to pursue higher education or receive formal training in civilian job skills. This can make it harder for them to find employment in their desired field.
3. Military Culture Shock: Returning to civilian life after being in the military can be challenging, especially if the individual is not prepared for the differences between military and civilian culture. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disorientation.
4. Difficulty Adjusting to a New Work Environment: Military personnel are often used to a strict hierarchy and structure, which can make it difficult for them to adjust to a more relaxed work environment in the civilian world.
5. Limited Social Network: After spending many years in the military, divorced personnel may find that their social network is limited, making it harder for them to find job opportunities or build new relationships.
6. Stigma of Divorce: Unfortunately, there can be a stigma attached to being divorced, particularly if the divorce was due to reasons related to the military lifestyle. This can make it harder for divorced military personnel to find employment or advance in their careers.
7. Difficulty Transferring Skills: Military skills and experience may not always translate directly to civilian jobs, making it challenging for divorced personnel to identify and showcase their transferable skills.
8. Limited Access to Resources: Divorced military personnel may have limited access to resources such as career counseling, job placement services, or networking opportunities, which can make it harder for them to find employment.
9. Difficulty Balancing Work and Family Responsibilities: After being in the military, divorced personnel may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities
