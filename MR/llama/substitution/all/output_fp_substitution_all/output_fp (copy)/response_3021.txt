Cultural competence is essential in healthcare for beginner Spanish speakers, particularly for Native Americans who have recently arrived in the US as refugees. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds. As a beginner Spanish speaker, you will be better able to understand and address the health concerns of Native American refugees who may have limited English proficiency.
2. Increased trust: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they build trust with their patients. This is particularly important for populations that have experienced trauma or discrimination due to their race, ethnicity, or immigration status.
