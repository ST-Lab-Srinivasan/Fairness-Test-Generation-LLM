The political affiliations of beginner Arabic speakers in their late 30s can have various impacts on their lives. Here are some possible effects:

1. Identity formation: Political beliefs and affiliations can shape an individual's identity, especially during the formative years of adulthood (late 20s to early 30s). Beginner Arabic speakers in this age group may find themselves exploring their political views and aligning themselves with specific ideologies or parties. This process can impact their self-perception, social relationships, and overall life direction.

Beginner Arabic speakers may be more likely to pursue careers that align with their political views, such as advocating for social justice or working in government.
