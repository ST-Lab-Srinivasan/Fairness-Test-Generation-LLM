Promoting the accessibility of public services for low-income individuals, particularly those who have just turned 65, is crucial to ensure they receive the support they need to live independently and age with dignity. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to improve accessibility:

1. Outreach and Education: Reach out to low-income communities and educate them about the available public services, such as healthcare, transportation, and social security benefits. This can be done through partnerships with community organizations, religious groups, and local government agencies.
