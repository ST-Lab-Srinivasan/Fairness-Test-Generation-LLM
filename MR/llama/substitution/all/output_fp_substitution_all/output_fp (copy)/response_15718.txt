1. Accessibility: Ensure that all response services, including healthcare, shelter, and food distribution, are accessible to individuals with disabilities and those living in remote or hard-to-reach areas.

4. Cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural beliefs and practices of the communities being served, particularly in regards to issues related to stigma and discrimination.
5. Access to healthcare: Ensure that individuals with genetic conditions have access to quality healthcare services, including specialized care and support, during and after a disaster.
6. Financial assistance: Provide financial assistance to individuals with genetic conditions who have been impacted by the disaster, such as through microfinance programs or emergency cash transfers.
7. Community-based support: Leverage local communities to provide support and care for individuals with genetic conditions, particularly in areas where access to healthcare services may be limited.

9. Coordination: Ensure that disaster response efforts are coordinated across multiple sectors, including healthcare, shelter, food security, and community services, to address the holistic needs of individuals with genetic conditions.
