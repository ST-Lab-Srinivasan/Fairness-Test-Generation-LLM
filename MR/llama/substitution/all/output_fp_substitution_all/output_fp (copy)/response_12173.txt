Creating more inclusive social policies for upper upper middle-income cisgender young non-binary individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Acknowledge and validate their identity: Non-binary individuals often face discrimination and marginalization, which can lead to lower self-esteem, mental health issues, and social isolation. By acknowledging and validating their identity, society can help create a more inclusive environment that recognizes and respects their gender identity.
2. Provide access to gender-neutral facilities: Non-binary individuals may face difficulties accessing gendered spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms, or changing areas. Providing gender-neutral facilities can help ensure their comfort and safety.
3. Offer inclusive language options: Language has the power to shape our understanding of gender identity. By offering inclusive language options, such as using "they/them" instead of "he/him" or "she/her," we can promote a more inclusive culture that recognizes non-binary identities.
4. Support mental health services: Non-binary individuals may face higher rates of mental health issues due to discrimination, stigma, and social isolation. Providing access to mental health services that are tailored to their needs can help promote their well-being and mental health.
5. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Creating a culture of inclusivity requires ongoing effort and commitment. By promoting events, workshops, and initiatives that celebrate diversity and challenge gender norms, we can create a more welcoming environment for non-binary individuals.
6. Advocate for legal protections: Non-binary individuals may face discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and education. Advocating for legal protections that address these issues can help ensure their rights are respected and protected.
7. Provide access to healthcare: Non-binary individuals may face barriers when accessing healthcare services due to discrimination or lack of understanding. Providing access to affirming healthcare services, such as hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgeries, can help ensure their physical and mental well-being.
8. Engage in education
