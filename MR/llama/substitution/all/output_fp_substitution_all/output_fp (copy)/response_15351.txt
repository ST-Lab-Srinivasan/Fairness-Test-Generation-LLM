Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-independent physically able-bodied individuals requires careful planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue is accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Offer sign language interpretation or captioning for deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals.
2. Accommodations: Provide accommodations such as seating areas for people who need to rest or have difficulty standing for long periods. Make sure there is ample space for mobility aids like wheelchairs, walkers, and canes.
3. Programming: Include activities that cater to the interests of non-independent physically able-bodied individuals, such as dance classes or workshops focused on creative expression. Offer sensory-friendly experiences, such as a quiet room for individuals with sensory processing issues.
4. Volunteer support: Train volunteers to assist with navigation, communication, and other tasks to ensure the event is accessible and enjoyable for all attendees.
5. Collaboration: Work with organizations that serve non-independent physically able-bodied individuals to co-create and promote the event. This can help reach a wider audience and ensure that the event is tailored to meet their needs.
6. Education: Provide training for staff and volunteers on disability etiquette, accessibility, and inclusive practices to ensure that all attendees feel welcome and included.
7. Communication: Offer multiple ways to communicate information about the event, such as large print, braille, or audio descriptions for individuals who are visually impaired. Provide advance notice of any changes or updates to the schedule.
8. Flexibility: Be flexible in accommodating individual needs, such as providing extra time for activities or modifying tasks to suit different abilities.
9. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive language and imagery in promotional materials to avoid perpetuating ableism and stigmatization. Highlight the accessibility features of the event and encourage people to attend who may have previously felt excluded.
10. Evaluation: Regularly evaluate the event's accessibility
