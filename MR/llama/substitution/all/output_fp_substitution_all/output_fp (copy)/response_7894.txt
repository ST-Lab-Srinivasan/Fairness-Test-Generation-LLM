Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-independent native English speakers requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, and Braille signage. This will enable individuals with mobility impairments to move around easily and independently.
2. Language Support: Provide language support services such as interpreters, translators, or bilingual staff to help non-independent native English speakers communicate effectively. This can include sign language interpretation for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and sensitivities when designing public spaces. For example, provide separate areas for men and women to pray or dress modestly, depending on the cultural context.

9. Accessibility Features: Incorporate accessibility features such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms to ensure that non-independent native English speakers can navigate the space easily.
10. Collaboration: Collaborate with organizations that support non-in
