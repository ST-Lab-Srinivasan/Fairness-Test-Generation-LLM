Creating more inclusive social policies for deep in poverty, long-term divorced individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this population. Here are some recommendations:

1. Recognize the intersections of oppression: Deep in poverty, long-term divorced individuals often face multiple forms of oppression, including gender, race, sexuality, and class. Policies must take into account these intersections of oppression and address them simultaneously.
2. Increase access to education and job training: Many deep in poverty, long-term divorced individuals lack the skills and knowledge necessary to secure better-paying jobs. Governments can provide funding for vocational training programs, adult education courses, and apprenticeships that cater specifically to this population.
3. Provide affordable housing options: Housing insecurity is a significant issue for many deep in poverty, long-term divorced individuals. Governments can invest in affordable housing programs, such as rent subsidies or homeownership initiatives, to help these individuals secure stable and affordable housing.
4. Strengthen social safety nets: Deep in poverty, long-term divorced individuals are often reliant on social safety nets, such as unemployment insurance, disability benefits, and food assistance programs. Governments can strengthen these programs by increasing funding and expanding eligibility criteria to reach more individuals.
5. Address systemic barriers to employment: Discrimination, lack of access to transportation, and inadequate childcare are significant barriers to employment for many deep in poverty, long-term divorced individuals. Policies can address these systemic issues by implementing anti-discrimination measures, investing in public transportation, and providing affordable childcare options.
6. Promote financial inclusion: Many deep in poverty, long-term divorced individuals lack access to traditional banking services, making it difficult for them to save money or access credit. Governments can promote financial inclusion by setting up community banks or partnering with microfinance institutions to provide financial services tailored to this population.
7. Support mental health and wellness: The experience of deep in poverty and long-term divorce can have significant psychological impacts on individuals. Polic
