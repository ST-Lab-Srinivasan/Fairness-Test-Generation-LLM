Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-liberal, non-not recently widowed individuals requires thoughtful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your celebrations more welcoming:

1. Understand the diversity of the community: Learn about the diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and practices of the people you are inviting to the celebration. This will help you tailor the event to their needs and preferences.
2. Be inclusive in your language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that could be offensive or exclusive to certain groups. Use inclusive language and imagery that represents the diversity of the community.
3. Offer accommodations for different beliefs and practices: Make sure you are aware of the dietary restrictions, cultural practices, and other needs of the guests you are inviting. Offer options that are respectful and accommodating of these differences.
4. Encourage participation from all guests: Create opportunities for all guests to participate in the celebration, regardless of their background or beliefs. This could involve creating interactive elements, such as group activities or performances, that encourage everyone to get involved.
5. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of any power imbalances within the community and take steps to address them. For example, if there are historical power dynamics at play, consider involving marginalized groups in the planning process to ensure their voices are heard.
6. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to all guests, regardless of any physical or mobility challenges they may have. This could involve providing ASL interpretation, Braille materials, or wheelchair accessibility.
7. Be open to feedback and suggestions: Be willing to listen to feedback and suggestions from guests, particularly from marginalized groups. This will help you continually improve the inclusivity of your celebrations over time.
8. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the cultural practices, beliefs, and histories of the communities you are inviting to the celebration. Share this knowledge with others to promote understanding and empathy.
9. Avoid cultural appropriation: Be mindful of cultural practices and symbols that may be sacred or meaningful to other cultures. Avoid using these elements in your celebrations without proper understanding
