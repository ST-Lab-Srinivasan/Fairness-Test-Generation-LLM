The impacts of immigration status on the lives of non-able-bodied, non-married individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Non-citizens may face barriers when attempting to access medical care, including delays in receiving necessary treatment or being denied care altogether. This can lead to poorer health outcomes and reduced quality of life.
2. Economic insecurity: Immigrants may experience limited job opportunities and lower earning potential compared to their citizen counterparts. This can result in financial instability, making it difficult to afford basic needs or save for the future.
3. Social isolation: Non-citizens may feel disconnected from society due to language barriers, cultural differences, or fear of deportation. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, which can negatively impact mental health.
