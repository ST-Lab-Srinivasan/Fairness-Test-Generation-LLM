Using data to highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers can be a powerful way to raise awareness and advocate for their needs. Here are some ways you could use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Reach out to beginner English speakers and gather data through surveys or interviews about their experiences learning the language, including any challenges they face. You could ask questions about their language learning background, motivation, and goals, as well as any obstacles they encounter.
2. Analyze language learning apps: Examine popular language learning apps and websites to see how they cater to beginner English speakers. Look at features such as content, user interface, and pricing to identify areas where these resources may be inadequate or exclusive.
3. Compare learner data to language proficiency standards: Research the language proficiency levels of beginner English speakers compared to global language learning benchmarks, such as the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) or the Language Proficiency Grid. Analyze how learners measure up against these standards and identify any gaps in their language development.
4. Investigate academic research: Consult academic studies on language acquisition and second language learning to gain insights into the cognitive, social, and psychological factors that influence beginner English speakers' language learning experiences. Look for patterns or trends in the data that can help inform your advocacy efforts.
5. Analyze government statistics: Examine data from government agencies responsible for education or immigration to see how they track the progress of beginner English speakers in their language learning journeys. Identify any challenges or obstacles faced by these individuals and use this information to develop targeted solutions.
6. Conduct case studies: Choose a few representative individuals who are struggling with language learning and conduct in-depth interviews or observations to gather detailed data on their experiences. Use these findings to illustrate the specific issues that beginner English speakers face and how they can be addressed.
7. Collaborate with educational institutions: Work with language schools, community centers, or other organizations that provide language learning programs for beginner English speakers. Share your findings with them and explore ways to address the challenges you've identified together.
8. Create visual aids:
