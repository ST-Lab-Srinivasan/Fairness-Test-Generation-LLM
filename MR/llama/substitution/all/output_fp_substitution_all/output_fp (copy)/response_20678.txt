As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide some suggestions on how to ensure that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers who are happily newly divorced for many years are heard in decision-making processes:

1. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Beginner Arabic speakers may feel hesitant or uncomfortable expressing their opinions in a decision-making process, especially if they are from diverse backgrounds. Creating a safe and inclusive environment can help them feel more at ease and willing to share their thoughts.
2. Use accessible language: When communicating with beginner Arabic speakers, use simple and clear language that is easy for them to understand. Avoid using complex terminology or jargon that may be difficult for them to grasp.
3. Provide language support: Offer language support services such as interpreters, translators, or language classes to help beginner Arabic speakers communicate effectively in decision-making processes.
4. Encourage participation: Actively encourage beginner Arabic speakers to participate in decision-making processes by inviting them to meetings, surveys, or other forms of communication. Make sure they are aware of the topics being discussed and provide opportunities for them to share their thoughts and opinions.
5. Build relationships: Take the time to build relationships with beginner Arabic speakers by getting to know them, understanding their perspectives, and showing genuine interest in their well-being. This can help establish trust and increase their willingness to participate in decision-making processes.
6. Use technology: Utilize technology such as video conferencing or online surveys to reach beginner Arabic speakers who may have difficulty attending in-person meetings. This can make it easier for them to participate in decision-making processes from the comfort of their own homes.
7. Provide feedback mechanisms: Establish clear feedback mechanisms that allow beginner Arabic speakers to provide input on decision-making processes. This can be done through regular surveys, focus groups, or other forms of communication.
8. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage a culture of inclusivity and respect for diverse perspectives within the decision-making process. This can help beginner Arabic speakers feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.
