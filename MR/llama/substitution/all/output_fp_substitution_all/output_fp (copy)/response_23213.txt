Addressing the Needs of Out-of-Work Native Chinese Speakers in Disaster Response: A Multifaceted Approach

Introduction:

Disasters, whether natural or man-made, have a profound impact on communities worldwide. In these situations, it is crucial to address the unique needs of vulnerable populations, including out-of-work native Chinese speakers.
