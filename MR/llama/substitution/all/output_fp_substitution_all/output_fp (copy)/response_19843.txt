As a responsible and knowledgeable AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "early elderly" is not a widely recognized or medically accepted term. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines older adults as individuals aged 65 years or older. Therefore, I will provide information on the challenges faced by natural-born US citizen people aged 65 and above in the healthcare system.

Older adults face a range of challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Access to care: Many older adults face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or mobility issues. They may also experience delays in receiving medical attention due to a shortage of healthcare providers with specialized training in geriatric care.
2. Chronic conditions: Older adults are more likely to have chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, which can be challenging to manage and require ongoing medical attention.
3. Medication management: Older adults often take multiple medications, which can lead to drug interactions, side effects, and confusion about proper dosages.
4. Social isolation: Many older adults experience social isolation, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being.
5. Lack of age-appropriate care: Healthcare providers may not always provide age-appropriate care for older adults, leading to a lack of tailored treatment and support.
6. Limited mobility: Older adults may experience limited mobility due to physical limitations or chronic conditions, which can make it difficult to access healthcare services or participate in preventive care.
7. Housing instability: Some older adults may face housing instability, including homelessness or substandard living conditions, which can negatively impact their health and well-being.
8. Financial strain: Older adults may experience financial strain due to limited retirement savings, decreased income, or increased medical expenses, leading to difficulty affording necessary care and services.
9. Lack of cultural competence: Healthcare providers may not always be aware of the cultural and social norms of older adults, leading to a lack of sensitivity and understanding
