As a freedom advocate and native natural-born US citizen, I have observed several challenges faced by Indigenous peoples in the US healthcare system. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. Lack of Cultural Competency: Many healthcare providers lack understanding and respect for the cultural practices and beliefs of Indigenous communities. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and inadequate treatment.
2. Limited Access to Healthcare: Indigenous peoples often face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to geographical isolation, lack of transportation, and limited availability of healthcare services in their communities.
3. Historical Trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has led to intergenerational trauma in Indigenous communities. This can manifest in mental and physical health issues, such as substance abuse, suicide, and chronic diseases.
4. Health Disparities: Indigenous peoples experience significant disparities in health outcomes compared to the general population. For example, they are more likely to experience higher rates of diabetes, heart disease, and other chronic conditions.
5. Lack of Trust: The historical abuse and neglect of Indigenous peoples by the healthcare system has led to a lack of trust in medical providers and institutions. This can make it difficult for Indigenous individuals to seek medical care or adhere to treatment plans.
6. Language Barriers: Many Indigenous communities have their own languages and dialects, which can create barriers to communication between healthcare providers and patients.
7. Limited Resources: Indigenous communities often face economic challenges that limit access to resources such as healthy food, clean water, and adequate housing, which can impact overall health outcomes.
8. Stigma and Discrimination: Indigenous peoples may experience discrimination and stigma due to their race or ethnicity, which can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment about seeking medical care.
9. Lack of Cultural Humility: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural practices and beliefs of Indigenous communities, leading to a lack of cultural humility and understanding in the delivery of care.
