Supporting the civic engagement of Native American recent refugees to the US permanent residents is crucial for their integration into the society and for the well-being of their communities. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Voter registration and education: Many Native American refugees may not be registered to vote or aware of the voting process. Provide them with information on voter registration, voting laws, and the importance of participating in the electoral process.
2. Civic participation opportunities: Encourage Native American refugees to participate in community events, volunteer work, and other civic activities that promote social cohesion and engagement.
3. Language support: For many Native American refugees, English may not be their primary language. Provide language support services, such as translation and interpretation, to ensure they can fully participate in the civic process.
4. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for elected officials, community leaders, and other stakeholders to better understand the unique needs and experiences of Native American refugees.
5. Community outreach and engagement: Establish relationships with local Native American communities and organizations to promote civic engagement and build trust between these groups.
6. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that support the civic engagement of Native American refugees, such as language access provisions in voting laws or increased funding for cultural competency training for elected officials.
7. Leadership development: Provide leadership development opportunities for Native American refugees to encourage them to take on leadership roles within their communities and promote civic engagement.
8. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair experienced community leaders with newer immigrant and refugee populations, providing guidance and support for their civic engagement.
9. Community events: Organize community events that celebrate cultural diversity and promote civic engagement, such as festivals, parades, or other gatherings that bring people together.
10. Collaboration with other organizations: Work with other organizations that serve Native American refugees to provide coordinated support for their civic engagement. This can include sharing resources, expertise, and knowledge to promote greater impact.
