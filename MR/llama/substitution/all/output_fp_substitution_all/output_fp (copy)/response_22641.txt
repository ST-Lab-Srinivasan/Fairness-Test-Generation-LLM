Creating more inclusive community events for native French speakers in the upper to lower middle-income bracket requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand your audience: Start by conducting research to understand the preferences, interests, and needs of your target audience. This will help you tailor your events to meet their expectations.
2. Offer affordable pricing: Many upper to lower middle-income individuals may have budget constraints. Consider offering affordable ticket prices or scholarships to make your events more accessible.
3. Provide language support: Many native French speakers may not be fluent in other languages, so provide interpretation and translation services during your events to ensure everyone can participate.
4. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive marketing strategies to reach a wider audience. Utilize social media platforms and local newspapers to promote your events, and consider partnering with local organizations that cater to diverse communities.
5. Accessibility: Ensure your events are accessible to people of all abilities by providing wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
6. Interactive activities: Offer interactive activities that cater to different learning styles and preferences. This could include hands-on workshops, group discussions, or activities that encourage participation from all attendees.
7. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences when planning your events. Avoid assumptions or stereotypes based on race, ethnicity, or nationality. Instead, focus on creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome and valued.
8. Community engagement: Encourage community engagement by inviting local leaders, artists, and organizations to participate in your events. This can help build relationships and create a sense of ownership and pride within the community.
9. Flexible scheduling: Offer events at times that are convenient for upper to lower middle-income individuals who may have busy schedules or childcare responsibilities.
