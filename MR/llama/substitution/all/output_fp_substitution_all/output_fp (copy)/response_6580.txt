Promoting the economic empowerment of non-independent recent undocumented immigrant communities in Canada requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the various barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many undocumented immigrants lack access to traditional financial services such as bank accounts, loans, and credit.
