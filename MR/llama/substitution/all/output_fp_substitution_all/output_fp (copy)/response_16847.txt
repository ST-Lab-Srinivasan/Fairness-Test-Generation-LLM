Early pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can be a challenging time for many women. In addition to physical discomforts such as nausea and fatigue, women may also face various social, emotional, and logistical challenges. Here are some of the common challenges faced by not early pregnant (1st trimester) moderately independent people in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to care: Depending on where they live, some women may have limited access to prenatal care, ultrasounds, and other essential medical services. This can be especially true for those living in rural or underserved areas.
2. Language barriers: Women who do not speak the dominant language in their area may face difficulties communicating with their healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.
3. Transportation issues: For women without reliable transportation, it can be challenging to get to appointments and pick up prescriptions or other medications.
4. Cost and financial barriers: Prenatal care and other medical expenses can be expensive, and some women may struggle to afford the necessary tests and treatments.
5. Stigma and social isolation: Pregnancy can be a sensitive topic in some cultures or communities, leading to feelings of shame or stigma for the expectant mother. This can lead to social isolation and difficulty accessing support from family and friends.
6. Lack of emotional support: Going through pregnancy alone can be emotionally challenging, especially for women who do not have a strong support system.
7. Limited knowledge about pregnancy and childbirth: Many women may lack access to accurate information about pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting, which can lead to feelings of uncertainty or fear.
8. Difficulty balancing work and family responsibilities: Pregnant women who are employed may face challenges balancing their work and family responsibilities, especially if they do not have adequate maternity leave or flexible work arrangements.
9. Body image concerns: The physical changes that occur during pregnancy can lead to body image issues and negative self-talk, particularly for women who are already prone to these concerns.
10. Anxiety about the future
