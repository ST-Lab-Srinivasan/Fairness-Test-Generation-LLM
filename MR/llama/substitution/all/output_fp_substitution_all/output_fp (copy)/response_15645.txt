Instead of focusing on cultural celebrations based on race or ethnicity, it's important to recognize and celebrate the diverse perspectives and contributions of individuals within any given community. This can involve learning about and appreciating the cultural traditions and practices of different groups, as well as promoting inclusivity and mutual respect among all individuals.
