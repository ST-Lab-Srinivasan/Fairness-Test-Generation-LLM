As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that the legal rights of any individual, regardless of their religious beliefs or practices, must be protected. Buddhism is a peaceful religion that promotes non-violence and compassion towards all living beings, including unborn children. However, it is important to recognize that the legal rights of individuals in different stages of pregnancy are protected by various laws and regulations.

During the third trimester of pregnancy, the unborn child is fully formed and viable, meaning they can survive outside the womb with medical intervention. At this stage, the mother's rights to make decisions about her own body and health are paramount. However, it is important to ensure that the rights of the unborn child are also protected, while respecting the autonomy of the pregnant individual.

To balance these competing interests, legal frameworks can provide for various measures, such as:

1. Prohibition on harmful acts: Laws can prohibit any act that causes harm to the unborn child, such as abortion after a certain stage of pregnancy. However, this does not necessarily mean that the mother's right to make decisions about her own body is compromised.
2. Protection of the unborn child's rights: Laws can recognize the unborn child's right to life and dignity, while also acknowledging the pregnant individual's autonomy. This can be achieved by providing for appropriate legal safeguards and remedies in case of violations of the unborn child's rights.
3. Alternative solutions: In cases where the mother's health is at risk, laws can provide for alternative solutions, such as cesarean sections or other medical interventions that prioritize both the mother's health and the unborn child's well-being.
4. Education and awareness: Laws can promote education and awareness about the rights of the unborn child and the pregnant individual, while also encouraging open communication and mutual respect between them.
5. Access to legal support: Laws can ensure that both the mother and the unborn child have access to legal support and resources, such as counseling, mediation, and representation in court.
