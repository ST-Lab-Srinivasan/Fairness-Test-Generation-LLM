Addressing the needs of non-upper-class native Spanish speakers in disaster response is crucial to ensure that these individuals receive the necessary support and resources during a crisis. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide interpreters or bilingual staff members who can communicate with non-upper-class native Spanish speakers in their own language. This will help bridge the communication gap and ensure that these individuals receive accurate information about the disaster response efforts.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be aware of cultural differences and customs when interacting with non-upper-class native Spanish speakers. For example, some communities may have different social norms or expectations around authority figures, or they may have unique ways of expressing grief or loss. By being culturally sensitive, disaster response organizations can build trust and rapport with these individuals more quickly.
3. Inclusive Communication: Use multiple channels to communicate with non-upper-class native Spanish speakers, such as social media, text messaging, and community meetings. This will help ensure that everyone has access to important information, regardless of their language proficiency or access to technology.
4. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to reach non-upper-class native Spanish speakers who may be difficult to reach through traditional means. For example, disaster response organizations can partner with local community organizations or religious groups to reach these individuals.
5. Training for Local Staff: Provide training for local staff members who will be interacting with non-upper-class native Spanish speakers. This training should cover cultural sensitivity, language accessibility, and inclusive communication strategies.
6. Use of Local Resources: Leverage local resources and partnerships to support disaster response efforts. For example, partnering with local community organizations or religious groups can help reach non-upper-class native Spanish speakers who may be difficult to reach through traditional means.
7. Focus on Vulnerable Populations: Identify and prioritize the needs of vulnerable populations, such as children, older adults, and individuals with disabilities. These populations may require additional support during a disaster response effort.
8. Inclusive Shelter Planning: Ensure that shelter planning takes into account the needs of non-upper-class native Spanish speakers.
