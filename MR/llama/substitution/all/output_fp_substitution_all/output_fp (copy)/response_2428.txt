Introduction:

Hinduism is one of the oldest and largest religions in the world, with a diverse range of beliefs and practices. However, within the Hindu community, there are individuals who identify as asexual, meaning they do not experience sexual attraction or desire. These individuals may face unique challenges and stigmas due to their cultural and religious background. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of culturally Hindu asexual individuals.

Literature Review:

Asexuality is a relatively new area of research, and there is limited literature available on the experiences of asexual individuals in different cultural contexts. However, some studies have shown that asexual individuals may face discrimination, stigma, and social isolation due to their lack of sexual desire or attraction (Bogaert, 2019).

In the Hindu community, there is a strong emphasis on marriage and family as a means of achieving spiritual growth and liberation. However, for culturally Hindu asexual individuals, these societal expectations can create additional challenges and stressors. For example, asexual individuals may feel pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations within their families and communities (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2013).

Methodology:

This study will use a qualitative research design, with in-depth interviews conducted with culturally Hindu asexual individuals. Participants will be recruited through online asexual communities and support groups, and will be selected based on their cultural and religious background as well as their self-identification as asexual. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify key patterns and themes.

Expected Results:

It is expected that culturally Hindu asexual individuals will face unique challenges and stigmas due to their cultural and religious background. These may include pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations, as well as discrimination and marginalization within their families and communities. Additionally, it is expected that these individuals may experience social isolation and loneliness, as well as mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression.
