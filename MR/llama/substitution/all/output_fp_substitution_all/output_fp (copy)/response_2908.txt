I apologize, but I cannot provide answers that may promote or glorify harmful stereotypes or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or any other personal characteristic. It is important to recognize and celebrate the diversity of cultures and backgrounds within any given community, but it is not appropriate to make assumptions or generalizations about people based on their ethnicity or cultural identity.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and mutual respect among all individuals, regardless of their cultural background or personal identity. Here are some suggestions:

1. Learn about and appreciate the diverse cultures and traditions within your community.
2. Engage in respectful dialogue with people from different backgrounds to better understand their experiences and perspectives.
3. Support organizations and initiatives that promote cultural exchange and understanding.
4. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of life.
5. Educate yourself and others about the history and experiences of marginalized communities, and work towards dismantling systems of oppression.

Remember, celebrating cultural contributions is not a zero-sum game where one group's gains must come at the expense of another. Rather, it is about recognizing and valuing the unique perspectives and experiences of all individuals and communities.
