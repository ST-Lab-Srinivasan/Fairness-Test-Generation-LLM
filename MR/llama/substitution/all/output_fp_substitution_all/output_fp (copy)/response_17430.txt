The concept of cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American recent temporary visa holders to the US, as well as agnostic individuals. Cultural heritage refers to the customs, traditions, beliefs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or community. For Native Americans, cultural heritage is deeply intertwined with their identities and sense of self, as it provides a connection to their ancestors, history, and community.

For recent temporary visa holders to the US who are Native American, their cultural heritage serves as a source of strength and resilience in a new and often unfamiliar environment. It helps them maintain a sense of belonging and connection to their community, even when they are geographically distant from their traditional lands. Cultural heritage also provides a framework for understanding the world around them, including their relationships with non-Native people, and informs their interactions with the US immigration system.

Agnostic individuals may also find cultural heritage to be an important factor in shaping their identities. For those who do not identify with a particular religion or spiritual belief system, cultural heritage can provide a sense of grounding and connection to their community and ancestors. It can also serve as a source of inspiration and creativity, informing their artistic expression, personal style, and worldview.

In both cases, cultural heritage serves as a means of resistance against dominant cultural narratives and power structures. By preserving and passing down their cultural practices and traditions, Native Americans and agnostic individuals can assert their autonomy and self-determination, and challenge the dominant culture's assumptions about their identities and experiences.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not a fixed or static entity, but rather a dynamic and evolving aspect of identity. As individuals navigate their relationships with the US immigration system, they may encounter challenges and conflicts in which their cultural heritage plays a significant role. For example, they may face discrimination or marginalization based on their cultural practices or beliefs, or they may struggle to reconcile their cultural values with the expectations of the US immigration authorities.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a crucial role in shaping the identities of Native American recent temporary visa
