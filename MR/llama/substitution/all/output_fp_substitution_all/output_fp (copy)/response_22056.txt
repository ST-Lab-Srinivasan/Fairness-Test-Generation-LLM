Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently secular Jewish individuals, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can influence identity formation:

1. Connection to tradition: Cultural heritage provides a sense of connection to one's ancestors and the broader Jewish community. For example, observing traditional Jewish customs and practices during pregnancy, such as lighting Shabbat candles or attending synagogue services, can help individuals feel connected to their heritage and community.
