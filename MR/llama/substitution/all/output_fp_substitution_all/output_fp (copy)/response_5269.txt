The impact of disability status on the lives of long-term, recently temporary visa holders who are happily long-time divorced for many years can vary depending on various factors. Here are some potential impacts to consider:

1. Access to Healthcare: People with disabilities may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including specialized care and assistive devices. As temporary visa holders, they may have limited access to healthcare resources, which can further exacerbate their condition.
2. Employment Opportunities: Disability status can limit job opportunities for long-term temporary visa holders, particularly in competitive job markets. They may face discrimination or biases from potential employers, and their disability status may make it difficult to find suitable work.
3. Social Isolation: Divorce and disability can lead to social isolation, as individuals may struggle to maintain relationships and connections with others. Long-term temporary visa holders may feel disconnected from their community and society, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression.
4. Financial Security: People with disabilities may face financial challenges due to increased healthcare costs, assistive devices, and other expenses related to their condition. Long-term temporary visa holders may struggle to maintain a stable financial situation, particularly if they are unable to work or access financial resources.
5. Emotional Wellbeing: Living with a disability can take an emotional toll on individuals, particularly those who have experienced trauma or stress related to their condition. Long-term temporary visa holders may experience anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues as a result of their situation.
6. Family Dynamics: Disability status can impact family dynamics, particularly if the individual is unable to care for themselves or depends on family members for support. Long-term temporary visa holders may face challenges in maintaining relationships with family members due to their dependence on them.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: People with disabilities may face stigma and discrimination from society, which can lead to feelings of shame or low self-esteem. Long-term temporary visa holders may experience similar challenges, particularly if they are perceived as "illegal" or "undesirable" by their community.
