To create more inclusive social policies for non-low-income professional individuals who are not recently single, it's important to consider the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Addressing the gender pay gap: Non-low-income professional women often face a significant pay gap compared to their male counterparts. Policies aimed at reducing this gap, such as equal pay for equal work, can help level the playing field.
2. Providing affordable childcare: Professional individuals with non-traditional family structures (e.g., single parents or those without a spouse) may struggle to balance work and family responsibilities. Policies that provide affordable childcare options can help alleviate some of this stress.
3. Encouraging flexible work arrangements: Non-low-income professionals may face pressure to work long hours or be tied to a specific location, which can be challenging for those with caregiving responsibilities. Policies that promote flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or compressed workweeks, can help strike a better balance between work and personal life.
4. Investing in education and career development: Non-low-income professionals may face barriers to advancing their careers due to a lack of access to training or educational opportunities. Policies that provide funding for professional development or scholarships can help level the playing field.
5. Addressing discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, non-low-income professionals from marginalized groups (e.g., racial/ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+) may face discrimination or bias in the workplace. Policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion can help create a more welcoming and inclusive environment.
6. Providing mental health support: Non-low-income professionals may experience higher levels of stress due to their careers or personal responsibilities. Policies that provide access to mental health resources, such as counseling or mental health days, can help promote well-being and reduce burnout.
7. Advocating for work-life balance: Non-low-income professionals may struggle to balance their work and personal lives due to the demands of their career.
