The impact of military status on the lives of non-liberal individuals extends beyond those living above the poverty line. Here are some additional impacts:

1. Limited access to education: In many countries, the military is seen as a path for social mobility, particularly for those from lower-income backgrounds. However, the quality of education within the military can be uneven, and there may be limited opportunities for advancement beyond basic training. This can limit the long-term career prospects of non-liberal individuals, especially those who do not have access to higher education or other forms of professional development.
2. Gender roles and stereotypes: Military cultures often perpetuate traditional gender roles and stereotypes, which can be restrictive for non-liberal individuals who may identify as LGBTQ+ or gender non-conforming.
