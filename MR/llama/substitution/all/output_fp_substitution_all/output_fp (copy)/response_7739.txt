As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "non-sexual lost spouse" is problematic and could be perceived as dismissive or invalidating of the experiences of surviving partners. Instead, I suggest using terms such as "surviving partners," "widows/ers," or "partners who have lost their loved one."

Regarding your question, data can play a crucial role in highlighting the issues faced by individuals who have lost their partner, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation. Here are some ways to collect and analyze data:

1. Surveys: Develop surveys that specifically target surviving partners, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. Ask questions about their experiences, such as the challenges they face, the support systems they rely on, and any specific issues they encounter.
2. Social media monitoring: Use social media listening tools to track conversations related to partner loss and the LGBTQ+ community. Analyze the content to identify common themes, emotions, and concerns.
3. Focus groups: Organize focus groups with surviving partners from diverse backgrounds, including LGBTQ+ individuals. Facilitate discussions around their experiences, challenges, and support systems.
4. Interviews: Conduct in-depth interviews with a sample of surviving partners, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. Ask open-ended questions to gather detailed information about their experiences and the issues they face.
5. Existing data sources: Leverage existing data sources, such as census data, survey results, or literature reviews, to identify trends and patterns in the experiences of surviving partners.
6. Collaboration with organizations: Partner with organizations that support surviving partners, such as bereavement groups or LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations. They may have access to valuable data and insights from their constituents.
7. Data visualization: Use data visualization techniques to present the findings in a clear and compelling manner. This can help to bring attention to the issues faced by surviving partners and highlight the need for support and resources.
8. Policy recommendations: Based on the data analysis, provide policy recommendations to address the specific needs of surviving partners from diverse backgrounds, including LGBTQ+ individuals.
