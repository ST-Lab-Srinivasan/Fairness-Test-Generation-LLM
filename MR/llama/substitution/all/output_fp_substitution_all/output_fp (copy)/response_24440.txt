As an AI language model, I appreciate your question about promoting the educational success of long-term recently divorced post-transition asexual students. However, I must clarify that the term "asexual" is not a widely recognized or validated diagnostic category in the field of psychology or sexuality. Asexuality is not an orientation or identity, but rather a personal preference or lack thereof when it comes to sexual activity.

That being said, promoting the educational success of any student, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, is essential for ensuring they have equal opportunities and support in their academic journey. Here are some suggestions on how to promote the educational success of long-term recently divorced post-transition students:

Encourage open communication and provide resources for students who need support.
2. Provide individualized support: Every student has unique needs, so it's crucial to provide individualized support based on their specific circumstances. Offer counseling services or connect them with a trusted teacher or mentor who can offer guidance and encouragement.

Ensure that your school provides access to mental health resources, such as counseling services or referrals to outside professionals, to help students manage any emotional challenges they may be facing.
7. Promote self-care and stress management:
