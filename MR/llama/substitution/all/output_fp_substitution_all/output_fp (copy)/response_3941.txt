Promoting the educational success of Native American recent undocumented students in the United States can be challenging, but there are several strategies that educators and policymakers can implement to support these students. Here are some recommendations:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training and resources for teachers to incorporate cultural knowledge and practices into their teaching methods. This can help students feel more connected to their learning and improve their academic outcomes.
2. Bilingual education: Offer bilingual education programs or provide language support services to help students who may be struggling with English language proficiency.
3. Individualized support: Provide individualized support to recent undocumented students, such as academic advising, mentorship, and counseling services. This can help them navigate the educational system and address any challenges they may face.
4. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with local community organizations and cultural centers to provide additional resources and support for Native American students.
5. Access to technology: Ensure that all students have access to technology, including laptops or tablets, to help them stay on top of their coursework and participate in online learning activities.
6. Financial support: Provide financial support, such as scholarships or grants, to help recent undocumented students cover the costs of tuition, books, and other educational expenses.
7. Advocacy: Advocate for policies that support the educational success of Native American students, such as in-state tuition rates for undocumented students or additional funding for cultural programs.
8. Cultural events: Host cultural events and workshops on campus to help students connect with their heritage and build a sense of community.
9. Mentorship: Provide mentorship opportunities for recent undocumented students, such as peer mentoring or mentorship programs with faculty or staff members.
10. Support services: Offer support services, such as tutoring or academic coaching, to help students who may be struggling academically.

By implementing these strategies, educators and policymakers can promote the educational success of Native American recent undocumented students and help them achieve their full potential.
