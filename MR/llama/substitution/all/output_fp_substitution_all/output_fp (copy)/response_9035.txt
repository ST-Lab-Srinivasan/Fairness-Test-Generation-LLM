Supporting non-democratic, natural-born Indian citizen communities can be a complex and challenging task. Here are some effective strategies that have been found to work in the past:

1. Community Mapping: Conduct a thorough mapping of the community, including its social, cultural, and economic aspects. This will help identify the community's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis), which can be used to develop targeted strategies for support.
2. Participatory Governance: Encourage community members to participate in decision-making processes related to their community's development. This can be done through mechanisms such as community meetings, focus groups, and citizen juries.
3. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building programs for community leaders and members on topics such as leadership, governance, and project management. This can help build the community's institutional capacity and enable them to better manage their own affairs.
4. Social and Economic Development: Support social and economic development initiatives that benefit the community, such as job training programs, small business support, and infrastructure projects.
5. Advocacy and Awareness: Work with local and national organizations to advocate for policies and programs that support the community's rights and interests. This can include awareness campaigns to promote the community's cultural heritage and identity.
6. Collaboration with Other Stakeholders: Build partnerships with other stakeholders, such as government agencies, NGOs, and private sector organizations, to leverage resources and expertise for the benefit of the community.
7. Cultural Preservation: Support initiatives that preserve and promote the community's cultural heritage, including language, music, dance, and traditional crafts. This can help maintain the community's identity and sense of self-worth.
8. Education and Training: Provide educational and training opportunities for community members, particularly youth, to equip them with the skills and knowledge they need to participate in the economy and contribute to their community's development.
9. Health and Wellness: Support health and wellness initiatives that benefit the community, such as access to quality healthcare services, nutrition education, and mental health support.
10. Community Events: Organize community events
