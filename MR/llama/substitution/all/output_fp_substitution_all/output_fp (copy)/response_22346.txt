Creating more inclusive community events for recently arrived refugee children in the US can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity and awareness: Be mindful of the cultural backgrounds of the refugee children and their families. Be respectful of their customs, traditions, and beliefs. Provide cultural sensitivity training for event organizers and volunteers to ensure they can interact with the refugee community in a culturally appropriate manner.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to children with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and visual aids. This will help create an inclusive environment for all attendees.
3. Language support: Provide translation services during the event to help refugee parents and children communicate more effectively. You can also provide materials in multiple languages to cater to different linguistic needs.
4. Inclusive activities: Organize activities that are engaging and inclusive for all attendees, regardless of their cultural background or abilities. For example, you can include games, crafts, and other interactive activities that promote teamwork and collaboration.
5. Volunteer training: Provide training for volunteers on how to interact with refugee children, including tips on how to communicate effectively and be sensitive to their needs. This will help create a more positive experience for both the volunteers and the attendees.
6. Food and drink options: Offer food and drink options that cater to different dietary needs and restrictions, such as halal or kosher options, and non-dairy milk alternatives. This will help ensure that all attendees feel included and comfortable.
7. Involve the refugee community in planning: Involve the refugee community in planning and organizing the event to ensure that it meets their needs and expectations. This can help build trust and create a more inclusive environment.
8. Create a safe space: Ensure that the event provides a safe and welcoming environment for all attendees, including children who may have experienced trauma or violence in their home countries or during their migration journey. Provide trained staff or volunteers to provide emotional support and mental health resources as needed.
