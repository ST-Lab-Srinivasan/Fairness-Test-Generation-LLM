Creating more inclusive community events for Native Arabic speakers in the upper lower middle-income group requires careful consideration of their cultural background and socio-economic status. Here are some suggestions to make your events more inclusive:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Be respectful of the cultural practices and traditions of Native Arabic speakers. Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or insensitive to their culture.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that your event is accessible to people with different abilities. Provide sign language interpretation, Braille materials, and wheelchair accessibility for participants with disabilities.
3. Language support: Offer translation services in Native Arabic languages for those who may not speak English fluently. This will help break down language barriers and make your event more inclusive.
4. Affordability: Keep the cost of your event affordable for upper lower middle-income individuals. Consider offering scholarships, discounts, or sliding scale fees to make it more accessible.
5. Representation: Ensure that your event reflects the diversity of the Native Arabic speaking community. Include a diverse range of speakers, performers, and participants from different backgrounds and experiences.
6. Inclusive programming: Offer programming that caters to the interests and needs of Native Arabic speakers. This could include cultural workshops, language classes, or networking opportunities.
7. Promotion: Advertise your event through various channels, including social media, flyers, and word-of-mouth. Make sure to promote it in places where Native Arabic speakers are likely to see it, such as local community centers, mosques, and cultural organizations.
8. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities for Native Arabic speakers to get involved in the planning and execution of your event. This will help them feel more invested in the event and more likely to attend.
9. Community outreach: Reach out to local Native Arabic speaking communities through outreach events, flyers, and posters. Encourage them to participate and share their ideas for making the event more inclusive.
10. Feedback mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism to gather input from participants on how to improve future events. This
