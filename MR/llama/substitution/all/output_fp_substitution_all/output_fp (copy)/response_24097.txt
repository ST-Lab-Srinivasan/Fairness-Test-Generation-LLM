Creating more inclusive recreational activities for physically-disabled nominal Muslims requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consult with the community: Reach out to local Islamic organizations, mosques, and Muslim communities to gather input and feedback on what types of recreational activities would be most inclusive and enjoyable for physically-disabled nominal Muslims.
2. Provide adaptive equipment and resources: Offer adaptive equipment such as wheelchairs, walkers, and prosthetic limbs to ensure that everyone can participate in the recreational activities. Also, provide resources such as Braille books, sign language interpreters, and audio describers for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Offer modified sports and games: Develop modified versions of sports and games that can be played by physically-disabled individuals, such as wheelchair basketball, adaptive yoga, and tandem cycling.
4. Create accessible playgrounds: Design playgrounds with ramps, transfer stations, and other features that are easily accessible for physically-disabled children. Incorporate sensory components such as tactile surfaces and braille labels to cater to different learning styles.
5. Provide transportation options: Offer transportation services or work with local organizations to provide accessible transportation options for individuals who may have difficulty getting to recreational activities due to mobility issues.
6. Incorporate spiritual elements: Incorporate Islamic prayers and rituals into the recreational activities, providing a sense of community and spiritual connection for physically-disabled nominal Muslims.
7. Foster a supportive environment: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where physically-disabled nominal Muslims feel comfortable participating in recreational activities. Encourage peer-to-peer support and provide opportunities for individuals to connect with each other.
8. Collaborate with other organizations: Partner with organizations that specialize in serving physically-disabled populations, such as the National Multiple Sclerosis Society or the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, to gain insight into their resources and best practices.
9. Offer educational programs: Provide educational programs on Islamic teachings and practices related to disability and recreation, to help individuals understand how to create inclusive activities
