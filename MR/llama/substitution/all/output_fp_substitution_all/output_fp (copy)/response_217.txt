However, I understand your question and will provide some general suggestions on how to address the housing needs of ultra-independent nominal Muslim individuals.

This can be achieved by adopting fair and equitable zoning policies that prioritize affordable housing options for all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or practices.
3. Education and Awareness: Educate the broader community about the importance of inclusive housing policies and the need to provide affordable housing options for ultra-independent nominal Muslim individuals. This can be achieved through public awareness campaigns, workshops, and community events.
