Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-libertarian and non-newly widowed individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs of diverse communities: Learn about the customs, traditions, and values of different cultural groups to ensure that your celebration is inclusive of all. Conduct research or consult with members of each community to understand their specific needs.
2. Involve diverse representatives in planning: Invite representatives from various cultural groups to participate in the planning process. This will help ensure that the celebration is sensitive to the needs and preferences of each group.
3. Provide accommodations for accessibility: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to all by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
4. Offer a variety of food options: Provide a diverse range of food options that cater to different dietary requirements and preferences. This can include vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and halal options.
5. Incorporate cultural performances and activities: Include performances and activities that are representative of the diverse cultures involved in the celebration. This can include traditional dance, music, or art exhibitions.
6. Create a safe space for marginalized communities: Establish a safe space for marginalized communities to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done through designated areas or activities that promote inclusivity and respect.
7. Encourage dialogue and understanding: Foster dialogue and understanding between different cultural groups by promoting open communication and mutual respect. This can be achieved through workshops, discussions, or other interactive activities.
8. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials and resources that promote cultural awareness and appreciation. This can include books, films, or exhibitions that highlight the experiences and traditions of diverse communities.
9. Involve the community in decision-making: Encourage community members to participate in decision-making processes related to the celebration. This can help ensure that the event is responsive to the needs and preferences of all communities involved.
10. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge and address any power imbalances between different cultural groups.
