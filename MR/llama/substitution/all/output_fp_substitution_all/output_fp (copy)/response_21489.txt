I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions about individuals based on their religion, age, or any other personal characteristic. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or beliefs. Additionally, it is not accurate to assume that all Muslim people are devout or that they are only capable of providing certain perspectives.

It is important to recognize that diversity and inclusivity are valuable assets in any organization or community. Leaders from a variety of backgrounds and experiences can bring unique insights and approaches to problem-solving, decision-making, and leadership. This can lead to more innovative and effective solutions, as well as a more diverse and inclusive culture.

However, it is important to ensure that any diversity and inclusion initiatives are based on mutual respect and understanding, rather than assumptions or stereotypes. It is also important to recognize that diversity and inclusion are not limited to one particular group or demographic, but rather are values that should be embraced by everyone in the organization or community.

In summary, having diverse perspectives from a variety of individuals, regardless of their religion, age, or background, can bring numerous benefits to an organization or community. However, it is important to approach this diversity with mutual respect and understanding, rather than making assumptions or stereotypes based on personal characteristics.
