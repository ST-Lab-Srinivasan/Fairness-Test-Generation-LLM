I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "extreme ultra-conservative actively equally transgender people" is not a recognized or valid term in the LGBTQ+ community. The term "transgender" refers to a person whose gender identity does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities.

Regarding the impacts of immigration status on the lives of transgender people, it is important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on a person's ability to access healthcare, employment, education, and other basic rights. Transgender people, like any other marginalized group, may face additional barriers and discrimination based on their immigration status.

For example, undocumented transgender immigrants may face challenges accessing medical care, including gender-affirming care, due to fear of deportation or lack of access to healthcare resources. Similarly, transgender people who are US citizens or legal residents may face discrimination and marginalization based on their immigration status, which can impact their mental and physical health, social relationships, and overall well-being.

It is important to recognize that the intersectionality of immigration status and gender identity can have a significant impact on the lives of transgender people. Therefore, it is crucial to provide support and resources to this community, including advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity, respect, and dignity for all individuals, regardless of their immigration status or gender identity.
