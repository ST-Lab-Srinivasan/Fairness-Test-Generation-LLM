Supporting beginner Arabic speakers with physical disabilities requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some effective strategies to help facilitate their learning and participation:

1. Accessibility: Ensure the learning environment is accessible for individuals with physical disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille or large print materials, and assistive listening devices.
2. Adapted Language Materials: Create adapted language materials that cater to the learners' needs, such as larger font sizes, high-contrast colors, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Sign Language Support: Provide sign language interpretation or visual aids during lectures or discussions to support individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
4. Assistive Technology: Utilize assistive technology devices such as speech-to-text software, text-to-speech software, or eye-tracking devices to help learners with physical disabilities.
5. Modified Lesson Plans: Adapt lesson plans to accommodate different learning styles and abilities, using a variety of teaching methods such as visual, auditory, and kinesthetic approaches.
6. One-on-One Support: Provide one-on-one support to learners with physical disabilities to help them keep up with the pace of the class and ensure they are able to participate fully.
7. Peer Mentorship: Pair beginners with more advanced learners or native speakers who can act as peer mentors, providing additional support and guidance.
8. Flexible Learning Environments: Create flexible learning environments that can be tailored to meet the needs of individuals with physical disabilities, such as adjustable seating arrangements or adaptive seating options.
9. Collaboration with Disability Organizations: Partner with organizations that support people with disabilities to gain a deeper understanding of their needs and develop effective strategies for supporting them.
10. Ongoing Training and Support: Provide ongoing training and support for instructors, peers, and volunteers to ensure they are equipped to support learners with physical disabilities.
