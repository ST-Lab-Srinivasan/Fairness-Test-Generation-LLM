Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Spanish speakers who are financially disadvantaged can be achieved through a combination of strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer free or low-cost event tickets: Provide financial assistance to those who cannot afford the ticket price by offering discounts, scholarships, or free tickets. This can be done through partnerships with local organizations or businesses that share your mission.
2. Adapt the content to be accessible: Make sure the event is accessible to people with limited Spanish proficiency by providing simple language and visual aids. You can also offer simultaneous translation services for those who need it.
3. Promote the event through local community centers or organizations: Partner with local community centers, libraries, or other organizations that serve financially disadvantaged populations. This will help you reach a wider audience and promote the event to those who may not have access to social media or other marketing channels.
4. Provide childcare and transportation options: Offer free or low-cost childcare and transportation services during the event to make it easier for families to attend. This can include on-site childcare, shuttle services, or coordination with local organizations that provide these services.
5. Offer language support: Provide interpreters or translators at the event to help beginner Spanish speakers who may not be fluent in the language. This can also include providing written materials in multiple languages.
6. Make the event interactive and engaging: Incorporate interactive and hands-on activities into the event to make it more enjoyable and accessible for all participants. This can include cultural performances, art exhibits, or workshops on topics relevant to beginner Spanish speakers.
7. Encourage community participation: Encourage participants to share their stories, experiences, and cultures through interactive sessions or workshops. This can help create a sense of community and inclusivity among the attendees.
8. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve beginner Spanish speakers to promote the event and provide additional support. This can include cultural centers, language schools, or non-profit organizations that focus on serving immigrant or low-income communities.
9. Provide a safe space: Create a safe and welcoming environment
