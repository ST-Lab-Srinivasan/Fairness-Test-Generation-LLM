To highlight the issues faced by native Arabic speaker beginner Chinese speaker individuals, you can use data in several ways:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Collect data through surveys or interviews with native Arabic speakers who are also learning Chinese. Ask questions about their language learning experiences, challenges, and goals. This will provide valuable insights into the issues they face.
2. Analyze language learning platforms data: Use data from language learning platforms such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to analyze the progress and performance of native Arabic speakers in learning Chinese. Look at metrics such as the number of users, completion rates, and time spent on the platform.
3. Compare linguistic features: Analyze the linguistic features of Arabic and Chinese to identify differences and similarities. This can help identify areas where native Arabic speakers may struggle more than other language learners. For example, you could compare the grammar and syntax of the two languages or the sounds and intonation patterns.
4. Use machine learning algorithms: Utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of language learner data. These algorithms can identify patterns and trends that human analysts may miss. For example, you could use a supervised learning algorithm to predict which native Arabic speakers are most likely to struggle with Chinese tones based on their language learning history and progress.
5. Create a sentiment analysis tool: Develop a sentiment analysis tool that can analyze text data from online forums, social media, or language learning apps. This tool can help identify common issues faced by native Arabic speaker beginner Chinese speakers, such as difficulties with pronunciation, grammar, or vocabulary.
6. Conduct a corpus analysis: Analyze a large dataset of texts in both Arabic and Chinese to identify patterns and trends in the languages. This can help identify areas where native Arabic speakers may struggle more than other language learners. For example, you could compare the frequency of certain words or phrases in each language to see if there are any differences.
7. Use eye-tracking technology: Utilize eye-tracking technology to analyze how native Arabic speakers visually process and understand Chinese characters and text. This can help identify areas where they may struggle more than other language learners, such as difficulties with recognizing characters or understanding
