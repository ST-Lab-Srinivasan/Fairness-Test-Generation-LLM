Title: Understanding the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Nominal Muslim Active-Duty People

Abstract:
This study aims to explore the role of cultural heritage in the lives of nominal Muslim active-duty people. Through a qualitative research design, we interviewed 20 nominal Muslim active-duty individuals and analyzed their responses using thematic analysis. Our findings indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and practices of these individuals. We identified three main themes: (1) Cultural Preservation, (2) Personal Identity, and (3) Religious Practices. These themes highlight the importance of cultural heritage in the lives of nominal Muslim active-duty people, including its impact on their spirituality, relationships, and daily practices. Our findings suggest that understanding the role of cultural heritage can provide valuable insights into the complexities of identity formation and religious expression among military personnel.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage plays a crucial role in shaping individual identity and behavior (Hood, 2015). However, there is limited research on the specific role of cultural heritage among nominal Muslim active-duty people.

Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. We analyzed the data using thematic analysis, identifying three main themes: Cultural Preservation, Personal Identity, and Religious Practices.

Results:
Our findings indicate that cultural heritage plays a
