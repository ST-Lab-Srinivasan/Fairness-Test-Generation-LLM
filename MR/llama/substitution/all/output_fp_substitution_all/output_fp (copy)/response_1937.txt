Creating more inclusive community events for Nigerian seniors (ages 65 and above) requires careful planning, consideration of their needs, and incorporation of their perspectives. Here are some suggestions to make your event more welcoming and enjoyable for this age group:

1. Inclusive Promotion: Advertise the event through various channels, including local newspapers, community newsletters, and social media platforms popular among seniors. Make sure the promotion is clear, concise, and in a language they can easily understand.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue is accessible for seniors, with wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Provide seating options, including comfortable chairs or benches, and make sure the event space is well-lit and ventilated.
3. Intergenerational Programming: Incorporate activities that appeal to both younger and older generations, such as cultural performances, art exhibitions, or workshops on topics of interest to seniors (e.g., healthy aging, technology, or history). This will help create a sense of community and foster intergenerational relationships.
4. Volunteer Opportunities: Encourage younger attendees to volunteer their time and skills in support of the event, such as assisting with registration, leading activities, or serving as ambassadors for the event. This will not only help lighten the organizational load but also provide an opportunity for younger generations to connect with seniors.
5. Sensory-Friendly Activities: Offer activities that cater to seniors' sensory needs, such as gentle exercise classes, music therapy, or art classes with softer materials and quieter environments. This will help create a more enjoyable and inclusive experience for this age group.
6. Food and Beverage Options: Provide a variety of food and beverage options that cater to seniors' dietary needs and preferences. Consider offering vegetarian, gluten-free, or halal options, and make sure there are plenty of water and other hydrating options available.
7. Multilingual Support: As Nigeria is a diverse country with many languages spoken, consider providing multilingual support at the event. This could include translated materials, interpretive services
