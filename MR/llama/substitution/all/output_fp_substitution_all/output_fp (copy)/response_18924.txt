Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for permanent residents who are moderate in their cultural identity can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the permanent residents: It is essential to understand the needs and preferences of the permanent residents before organizing any cultural celebration. Conduct surveys or hold focus groups to gather information about their cultural background, beliefs, values, and practices. This will help you design a celebration that caters to their needs and preferences.
2. Involve the permanent residents in the planning process: Invite the permanent residents to participate in the planning process for the cultural celebration. This can be done by forming a committee or working group that includes representatives from different cultural backgrounds. This will ensure that the celebration reflects the needs and preferences of the permanent residents.
3. Showcase diverse cultures: Include a variety of cultural performances, food, and decorations to showcase the diversity of the permanent residents. For example, you could have a traditional Korean drumming performance followed by a Mexican mariachi band, and end with a Indian classical dance performance.
4. Provide interpretive materials: Provide interpretive materials such as signs, posters, and brochures that explain the cultural significance of the celebration. This will help educate the permanent residents about the different cultures represented in the celebration.
5. Offer cultural workshops: Offer cultural workshops or classes that teach the permanent residents about different cultures. For example, you could offer a cooking class where participants can learn how to make traditional dishes from different cultures.
6. Encourage intercultural dialogue: Encourage intercultural dialogue by providing opportunities for permanent residents to share their experiences and traditions with each other. This can be done through small group discussions or large group presentations.
7. Be respectful of cultural differences: Be respectful of the cultural differences and practices of the permanent residents. Avoid cultural appropriation and ensure that the celebration is inclusive and respectful of all cultures.
8. Make accommodations for accessibility: Make sure that the celebration is accessible to all permanent residents, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and Braille materials
