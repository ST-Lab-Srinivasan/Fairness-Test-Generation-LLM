Creating more inclusive public spaces for extreme, moderate, independent, and beginner French speakers involves understanding the unique needs and challenges of each group and designing spaces that cater to their requirements. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that all public spaces are accessible to individuals with mobility impairments by providing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Additionally, provide audio descriptions or braille signage for visually impaired individuals.
2. Language Support: Offer language support services such as interpreters or translation devices to help individuals who speak French but may not be fluent in the local language. This can include language classes or workshops for beginner French speakers.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural differences and practices of each group, and provide spaces that reflect their unique needs and preferences. For example, provide halal food options for Muslim individuals or designate gender-neutral bathrooms for non-binary individuals.
4. Adaptive Technology: Provide adaptive technology such as audio describers or braille displays to help visually impaired individuals access information and navigate public spaces more easily.
5. Inclusive Programming: Offer programming that caters to the diverse needs of each group, such as language exchange programs for extreme French speakers, cultural events for moderate French speakers, and beginner French classes for independent learners.
6. Collaboration with Community Groups: Work with community groups representing each of these groups to ensure that the public spaces are designed and tailored to meet their specific needs. This can involve conducting focus groups or surveys to better understand the unique challenges faced by each group.
7. Flexible Spaces: Create flexible spaces that can accommodate a variety of activities and events, such as multipurpose rooms or outdoor spaces with movable furniture. This can help ensure that individuals from all groups feel comfortable and included in public spaces.
8. Training for Staff: Provide training for staff on how to interact with and support individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those who speak French as a second language or have mobility impairments.
9. Accessibility Features: Incorporate accessibility features such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible parking into the design of public spaces.
