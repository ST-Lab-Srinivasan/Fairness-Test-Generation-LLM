3. Connection to ancestors: Cultural heritage serves as a connection to one's ancestors and history. For recent green card holders in Canada, their cultural heritage can help them connect with their ancestors' traditions and practices. Similarly, native recent refugees in the US may want to preserve their cultural heritage to honor their ancestors' legacy.
4. Identity formation: Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping one's identity. For example, recent green card holders in Canada may identify as both Canadian and [their country of origin], while native recent refugees in the US may identify as both American and their native culture.
