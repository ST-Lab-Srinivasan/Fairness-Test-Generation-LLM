To highlight the issues faced by financially disadvantaged natural-born Canadian citizen individuals using data, you could follow these steps:

1. Identify and gather data: Collect data on various factors that affect the financial well-being of Canadian citizens, such as income levels, wealth distribution, access to healthcare and education, and poverty rates. You can obtain this data from government reports, surveys, and other sources.
2. Analyze the data: Use statistical methods to analyze the data you have collected. Look for patterns and trends that reveal the financial challenges faced by natural-born Canadian citizens. For example, you might find that certain demographic groups (such as Indigenous peoples or racialized individuals) are disproportionately affected by poverty or lack of access to healthcare.
3. Visualize the data: Use data visualization techniques to present your findings in a clear and concise manner. This could include creating graphs, charts, and maps that illustrate the distribution of income, wealth, and access to resources across different regions and demographic groups.
4. Interpret the findings: Based on your analysis and visualizations, explain the financial challenges faced by natural-born Canadian citizens and identify potential solutions. For example, you might suggest policy changes or interventions aimed at addressing systemic issues such as income inequality, discrimination, or lack of access to education and job opportunities.
5. Communicate the findings: Share your analysis and recommendations with relevant stakeholders, including policymakers, community leaders, and advocacy groups. Use storytelling techniques to bring the data to life and make it more relatable and impactful.
