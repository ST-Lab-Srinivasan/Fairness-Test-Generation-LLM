Creating more inclusive cultural programs for non-native English speakers, including those from a Christian background, requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to help make your cultural programs more accessible and enjoyable for this group:

1. Provide interpretation or translation services: Offer interpretation or translation services during events or programs to ensure that non-native English speakers can fully participate and understand the content. This can be done through live interpretation, pre-recorded videos with subtitles, or hiring bilingual staff members to assist with communication.
