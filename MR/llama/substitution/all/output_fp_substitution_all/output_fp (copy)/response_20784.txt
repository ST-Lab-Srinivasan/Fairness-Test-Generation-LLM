5. Incorporate technology: Leverage technology to enhance the learning experience. Utilize language learning apps, websites, and other digital tools to provide interactive and personalized learning experiences.
6. Encourage self-directed learning: Encourage learners to take ownership of their learning by providing access to online resources and tools that they can use outside of class time.
7. Provide opportunities for cultural immersion: Offer opportunities for learners to engage in cultural events, festivals, and activities that promote language acquisition and cultural understanding.
