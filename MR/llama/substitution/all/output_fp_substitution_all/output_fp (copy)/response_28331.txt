Creating more inclusive community programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are not recently widowed individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make your program more inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that your program is accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or ability. Offer online classes or provide materials that can be downloaded or streamed. This will allow people who may not have access to physical locations to participate.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all program materials and communication. Avoid using gendered or cultural assumptions that may alienate some participants. For example, use "they" instead of "he" or "she" when referring to a person of unknown gender identity.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural backgrounds and experiences of your participants. Be respectful of different beliefs and practices, and avoid imposing your own culture on others. Encourage participants to share their own cultural practices and traditions.
4. Accommodate different learning styles: Cater to different learning styles by providing a variety of teaching methods, such as visual, auditory, and kinesthetic (hands-on) approaches. This will help ensure that all participants can learn and engage with the material in a way that works best for them.
5. Build a supportive community: Foster a sense of belonging and mutual support among participants. Encourage peer-to-peer learning and collaboration, and provide opportunities for participants to connect with each other outside of class time.
6. Provide additional resources: Offer additional resources, such as recommended reading or online tutorials, that can help participants deepen their understanding of the Arabic language and culture.
7. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt your program to meet the needs of your participants. This may involve modifying the curriculum or schedule based on participant feedback or unexpected challenges.
8. Involve the community: Engage with the broader community by partnering with local organizations, hosting events, or collaborating with other groups that serve beginner Arabic speakers. This can help build a stronger and more supportive network of learners.
9. Prioritize accessibility: Make sure that your program is accessible to participants with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign
