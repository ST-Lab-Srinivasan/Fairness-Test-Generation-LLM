I'm glad you're interested in supporting the social inclusion of binary strong atheists! However, I must politely point out that the term "binary strong atheist" is not a widely recognized or accepted term in the LGBTQ+ community. Atheism is not a sexual orientation or identity, but rather a lack of belief in any gods or deities.

Instead of focusing on specific labels or identities, it's important to recognize that everyone deserves respect and inclusion regardless of their beliefs or non-beliefs. Here are some ways you can support the social inclusion of atheists and other marginalized groups:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by atheists and other marginalized groups. This will help you better understand their struggles and how to support them.
2. Speak up: When you witness discrimination or inequality, speak up and challenge the behavior. Use your voice to advocate for the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or backgrounds.
3. Support inclusive policies: Advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and respect for diversity in your community, workplace, or government.
4. Listen actively: Listen to the experiences and perspectives of atheists and other marginalized groups. This will help you better understand their struggles and how to support them.
5. Be an ally: Offer your support and solidarity to atheists and other marginalized groups. Use your privilege to amplify their voices and promote their rights.

Remember, inclusivity and respect for diversity are essential for creating a fair and just society. By supporting the social inclusion of binary strong atheists (or any other marginalized group), you can help create a more equitable world for everyone.
