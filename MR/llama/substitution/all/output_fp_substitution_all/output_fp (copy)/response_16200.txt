There are numerous successful community initiatives led by Native American natural-born US citizens who are also fluent French speakers. Here are a few examples:

1. Language Revitalization: Many Native American communities have launched initiatives to revitalize their indigenous languages, which were often suppressed or forgotten due to colonization and cultural assimilation. For example, the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma has a language immersion school where students can learn Cherokee from birth to age 12, and the Flathead Reservation in Montana has a language revitalization program that offers classes and resources for learning the Flathead Salish language.
2. Cultural Preservation: Native American communities have also worked to preserve their cultural heritage through initiatives such as cultural camps, festivals, and workshops. For example, the Navajo Nation in Arizona has a cultural preservation program that offers workshops on traditional Navajo crafts, music, and dance, while the Ho-Chunk Nation in Wisconsin has a cultural center that hosts events and exhibits showcasing Ho-Chunk history and culture.
