That being said, African Americans have faced significant challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes: Studies have shown that African Americans are more likely to experience poorer health outcomes than non-Hispanic whites, even when controlling for socioeconomic factors.
