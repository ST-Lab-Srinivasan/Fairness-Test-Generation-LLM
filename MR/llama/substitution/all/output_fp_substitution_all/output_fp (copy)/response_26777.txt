Promoting the accessibility of public services for casual Buddhist moderates can be achieved through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that public spaces, such as parks, gardens, and other outdoor areas, are accessible to people of all beliefs and backgrounds. This can be done by providing comfortable seating areas, clean facilities, and adequate lighting.
2. Offer flexible scheduling: Allow for flexible scheduling of public services, such as meditation classes or Buddhist ceremonies, to accommodate the busy schedules of casual Buddhists. This can include offering classes at different times of the day or week, or providing online options for those who cannot attend in person.
3. Provide educational resources: Develop and provide educational resources, such as books, videos, or online courses, that cover basic Buddhist teachings and practices. This can help casual Buddhists learn more about the religion and its principles without feeling pressured to adhere to strict traditions.
4. Host interfaith events: Organize interfaith events that bring together people from different religious backgrounds to learn from one another and promote mutual understanding. This can help break down barriers between different religious groups and create a more inclusive environment.
5. Encourage dialogue: Facilitate open dialogue between Buddhists and non-Buddhists, encouraging the sharing of perspectives and ideas. This can help promote greater understanding and respect for one another's beliefs.
6. Offer accessible rituals: Develop rituals and practices that are accessible to people of all abilities and backgrounds. For example, instead of requiring participants to sit in a specific position for an extended period of time, offer flexible seating options or guided meditation sessions.
7. Provide translation services: Offer translation services during public services or events to accommodate those who may not speak the dominant language in the area. This can help ensure that everyone has access to the same information and resources.
8. Create a welcoming environment: Ensure that public spaces are welcoming and inclusive, with clear signage and wayfinding for those who may be unfamiliar with the area. Provide friendly customer service and address any concerns or questions from casual Buddhists in a respectful and professional manner.
