As a Beginner Arabic Speaker who has recently immigrated to the United States without proper documentation, there are several challenges you may face when accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the common obstacles:

1. Language Barrier: As an Arabic speaker, you may encounter difficulties communicating with healthcare providers who speak only English. This language barrier can make it hard to express your symptoms or understand medical instructions.
2. Lack of Documentation: Without proper documentation, such as a green card or proof of citizenship, you may face challenges when trying to access healthcare services. Many healthcare providers and hospitals require proof of insurance or immigration status before providing care.
