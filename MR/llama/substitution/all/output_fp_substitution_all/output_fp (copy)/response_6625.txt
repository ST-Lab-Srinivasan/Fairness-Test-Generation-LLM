Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of advanced, ultra-liberal individuals over the age of 85. Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to their growth:

1. Knowledge sharing: Older, wiser individuals can share their extensive knowledge and experience with younger, more liberal peers. This can help the latter gain a deeper understanding of complex issues and develop well-informed perspectives.
2. Personalized guidance: A mentor can provide tailored advice based on their mentee's unique experiences, interests, and goals. This personalized guidance can help the mentee navigate complex social and political issues more effectively.
3. Networking opportunities: Mentors often have extensive networks of contacts within various fields, including politics, activism, and business. They can introduce their mentees to these connections, providing valuable opportunities for collaboration, learning, and growth.
4. Role modeling: Advanced, ultra-liberal individuals can serve as role models for their younger peers. By demonstrating progressive values, they can inspire others to adopt similar beliefs and behaviors.
5. Emotional support: Mentorship can offer emotional support, which is crucial for the development of advanced, ultra-liberal individuals. A mentor can provide a safe space for their mentee to express themselves, share their concerns, and receive encouragement and guidance.
6. Cultural exposure: Mentors can expose their mentees to different cultures, ideas, and perspectives, helping them develop a more nuanced understanding of the world. This can broaden their horizons and foster empathy and inclusivity.
7. Personal development: A mentor can help their mentee identify and work on personal growth areas, such as communication skills, emotional intelligence, and self-awareness. By doing so, they can enhance the mentee's ability to engage in meaningful political discourse and make a positive impact.
8. Encouraging risk-taking: Advanced, ultra-liberal individuals may be more willing to take risks and challenge the status quo. A mentor can encourage their mentee to embrace calculated risks, experiment with new approaches, and develop a growth mind
