Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are ethnically Caucasian requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Understand the cultural context: It's essential to have a deep understanding of the cultural context of the communities you are working with. This includes learning about their customs, traditions, and values. By doing so, you can create programs that are relevant and meaningful to them.
2. Be aware of your privilege: As a non-Latinx person, it's important to be aware of the privilege you have in creating cultural programs for Spanish speakers. Acknowledge this privilege and work to use it to amplify the voices and experiences of marginalized communities.
3. Involve community members in the planning process: Involve ethnically Caucasian individuals who are also beginner Spanish speakers in the planning process of your cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are inclusive and meet the needs of this group.
4. Offer programs that cater to different learning styles: Offer a variety of programs that cater to different learning styles, such as visual, auditory, and kinesthetic. This can help ensure that all participants have an enjoyable and engaging experience.

6. Offer cultural immersion experiences: Offer cultural immersion experiences that allow participants to learn about and experience the culture firsthand. This can include visits to cultural events, festivals, or traditional cooking classes.
7. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for participants to connect with one another and build relationships. This can help foster a sense of community and inclusivity within the programs.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of power dynamics and work to create an inclusive environment where all participants feel valued and respected.
9. Provide resources for further learning: Provide resources for participants to continue learning about Spanish culture and language outside of the cultural programs. This can include recommendations for books, films, or
