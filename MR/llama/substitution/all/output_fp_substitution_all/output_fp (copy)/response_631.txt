It is important to recognize that the experiences of individuals with different immigration statuses can vary greatly, and it is not accurate or fair to make generalizations about a group of people based on their immigration status. However, I can provide some general information on the potential impacts of immigration status on the lives of permanent resident liberal people:

1. Access to healthcare: Depending on their immigration status, some permanent residents may not have access to the same healthcare benefits as U.S. citizens. This can be a significant concern, especially for those who are living with chronic conditions or who require ongoing medical treatment.
2. Education: The immigration status of a permanent resident can impact their ability to access higher education, including public universities and colleges. Some may face barriers to financial aid or scholarships due to their immigration status.
3. Employment: Permanent residents may face challenges in finding employment due to their immigration status. They may be unable to work in certain fields or industries, or they may face discrimination in the workplace.
4. Social and cultural isolation: Permanent residents may experience social and cultural isolation due to their immigration status. They may feel excluded from mainstream society or feel a lack of belonging in their community.
5. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can have a significant impact on the mental health and well-being of permanent residents, particularly those who are living with anxiety or depression.
6. Difficulty accessing social services: Permanent residents may face barriers to accessing social services such as food assistance programs, housing support, or legal aid due to their immigration status.
7. Limited political participation: Permanent residents may face challenges in participating in the political process due to their immigration status. They may be unable to vote or run for political office.
8. Stigma and discrimination: Permanent residents may experience stigma and discrimination from others due to their immigration status, which can have a significant impact on their mental health and well-being.
9. Lack of family unity: Permanent residents may face challenges in maintaining family unity due to their immigration status. They may be unable to sponsor family members for immigration or face separation from loved ones.
