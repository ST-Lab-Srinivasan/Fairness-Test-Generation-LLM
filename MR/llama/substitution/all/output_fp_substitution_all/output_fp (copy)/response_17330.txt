5. Job Training: Provide job training or resources to help them find employment, which can improve their self-esteem and overall well-being.
6. Mentorship Programs: Introduce them to mentorship programs that pair them with experienced Canadians, offering guidance on how to navigate everyday life in Canada.
7. Community Outreach: Connect them with local community outreach programs that provide support and resources for new immigrants, such as settlement services, language classes, and employment assistance.
8. Social Media Groups: Create or join social media groups specifically designed for recent green card holders in Canada, where they can connect with others who share similar experiences and challenges.
9. Local Events: Attend local events and gatherings with them, such as farmers' markets, parades, or street festivals, which can help them become more familiar with their new community.
