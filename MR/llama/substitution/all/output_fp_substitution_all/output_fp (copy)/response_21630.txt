There are several challenges that elite upper-class Native American individuals who are recently undocumented to the US may face within the healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: As undocumented immigrants, these individuals may not have access to healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be unable to afford health insurance or may fear seeking medical care for fear of being deported.
2. Language barriers: Many elite upper-class Native Americans who are recently undocumented to the US may speak indigenous languages as their primary language, which can create a barrier in accessing healthcare services. Healthcare providers may not be fluent in these languages, making it difficult for these individuals to communicate their health concerns.
3. Cultural barriers: There may be cultural barriers that prevent elite upper-class Native Americans from seeking medical care. For example, some Native American cultures have a strong belief in the importance of spiritual healing and may be hesitant to seek medical care that does not align with their cultural beliefs.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against undocumented immigrants is prevalent in the US healthcare system. Elite upper-class Native Americans who are recently undocumented to the US may face discrimination from healthcare providers, which can lead to a lack of trust and fear of seeking medical care.
5. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on their immigration status, elite upper-class Native Americans who are recently undocumented to the US may have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, or other specialists. This can be particularly challenging if they require complex medical procedures or treatments.
6. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The US healthcare system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. Elite upper-class Native Americans who are recently undocumented to the US may face challenges in navigating the system and understanding their options for medical care.
7. Fear of deportation: As undocumented immigrants, elite upper-class Native Americans may fear being deported if they seek medical care. This fear can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and
