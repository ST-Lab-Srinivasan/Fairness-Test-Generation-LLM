The impact of military status on the lives of non-independent individuals who are not living in poverty can vary depending on the specific context and circumstances. However, some potential impacts to consider include:

1. Limited access to resources and opportunities: Non-independent individuals may have limited access to resources and opportunities compared to independent individuals. This can include things like education, employment, and healthcare.
2. Dependence on others for support: Non-independent individuals may be dependent on others for financial or emotional support, which can limit their autonomy and independence.
3. Limited social connections: Non-independent individuals may have limited social connections and opportunities to form meaningful relationships, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.
4. Difficulty navigating bureaucratic systems: Non-independent individuals may face challenges when trying to access services or benefits due to complex bureaucratic systems.
5. Increased vulnerability to exploitation: Non-independent individuals may be more vulnerable to exploitation, particularly if they are dependent on others for financial support.
6. Limited opportunities for personal growth and development: Non-independent individuals may have limited opportunities for personal growth and development due to their dependence on others.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Non-independent individuals may face stigma and discrimination from society, which can further limit their opportunities and autonomy.
8. Limited access to credit and financial services: Non-independent individuals may have limited access to credit and financial services, which can make it difficult for them to purchase assets or start businesses.
9. Limited political representation: Non-independent individuals may have limited political representation, which can limit their ability to advocate for their rights and interests.
10. Limited social support networks: Non-independent individuals may have limited social support networks, which can make it difficult for them to access emotional or practical support during times of crisis.

It is important to note that these impacts can vary depending on the specific context and circumstances of the individual. Additionally, many non-independent individuals are able to overcome these challenges through their own efforts and resources, as well as through the support of friends, family, and community organizations.
