Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individual beginners in English language learning. It refers to the shared knowledge, traditions, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or community. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences identity formation:

1. Shared values and beliefs: Cultural heritage instills a sense of shared values and beliefs among individuals. For instance, in many Asian cultures, filial piety is highly valued, which can shape the identities of beginner English speakers who belong to these cultures.

For example, if a beginner is immersed in an environment where English is spoken regularly and consistently, they may pick up the language faster than someone who is not exposed to it.
