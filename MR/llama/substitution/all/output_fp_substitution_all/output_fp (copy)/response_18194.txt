Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner Chinese speakers, especially for native recent refugees to the US. Cultural heritage refers to the customs, traditions, beliefs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or society. For many refugees, their cultural heritage is an important part of their identity and can provide a sense of belonging and connection to their homeland, even after they have been displaced from it.

For beginner Chinese speakers who are native recent refugees to the US, cultural heritage can play several roles:

1. Preservation of identity: Cultural heritage helps preserve the identity of refugees by maintaining their connection to their homeland and culture. It allows them to hold onto their traditions, customs, and beliefs, which are essential to their sense of self and community.
2. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a larger cultural group and can help refugees connect with others who share similar cultural backgrounds. This can be especially important for refugees who may feel disconnected from their host society due to cultural differences or language barriers.
3. Navigation of displacement: Cultural heritage can serve as a source of comfort and familiarity in unfamiliar environments. For refugees who have been displaced from their homeland, cultural heritage can provide a sense of continuity and stability in the face of uncertainty.
4. Preservation of language and culture: As beginner Chinese speakers, native recent refugees to the US may be more motivated to learn and preserve their native language and culture due to the trauma and loss they have experienced. Cultural heritage can serve as a way to keep these aspects of their identity alive and passed down to future generations.
5. Bridge to the host society: While cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and connection to one's homeland, it can also serve as a bridge to the host society. By embracing and sharing their cultural heritage with others, refugees can build connections and foster understanding between different cultures.
6. Resilience and coping mechanism: Cultural heritage can be a resilience factor for refugees, helping them cope with the trauma and challenges of displacement. It can provide a sense of hope and possibility for the future
