Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Long-Term Divorced French Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for long-term divorced native French speakers. This group faces unique challenges in navigating their cultural identity due to their personal and social experiences. Through an exploratory study, this paper aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and how they negotiate their sense of self in a rapidly changing world.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity formation (Hood, 2013). For long-term divorced native French speakers, cultural heritage can serve as a source of comfort and stability during times of change and uncertainty. However, the process of divorce can also lead to a disruption in this heritage, potentially causing an individual to question their sense of self (Billingsley & Brown, 2013).

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from 15 long-term divorced native French speakers. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Findings:
Four main themes emerged from the data analysis: (1) Cultural heritage as a source of identity, (2) The impact of divorce on cultural heritage, (3) Navigating identity through cultural practices, and (4) Reconciling conflicting identities. Participants expressed a strong sense of connection to their cultural heritage, which served as a foundation for their identities. However, the process of divorce disrupted this heritage, leading to a re-evaluation of their sense of self.

Cultural practices played a significant role in helping participants navigate their identity. These practices provided a sense of continuity and stability, even during times of change. Participants also discussed the challenges of reconciling conflicting identities, particularly when their cultural heritage conflicted with their post-divorce identity.
