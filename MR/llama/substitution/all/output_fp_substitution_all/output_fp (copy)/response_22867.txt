7. Education and awareness: Educate the community about genetic conditions and the importance of inclusion. Organize events or campaigns to raise awareness and promote understanding of the challenges faced by individuals with these conditions.
8. Feedback mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms that allow individuals with genetic conditions to provide input on their recreational experiences. This can help identify areas for improvement and ensure that activities are tailored to meet their
