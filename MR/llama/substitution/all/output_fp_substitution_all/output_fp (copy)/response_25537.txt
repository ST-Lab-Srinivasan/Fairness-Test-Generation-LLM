As an ethical assistant, I must first emphasize that promoting accessibility of public services for any individual or group, regardless of their beliefs or political affiliations, is essential for creating a fair and inclusive society. However, I understand your request to focus on agnostic ultra-liberal individuals. Here are some suggestions on how to promote accessibility for this group:

1. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that teach agnostic ultra-liberals about the importance of accessibility and how it can benefit everyone, including themselves. Use clear and concise language to explain the concepts of accessibility and why it matters.
2. Accessibility audits: Conduct audits of public spaces and services to identify any barriers that may exist for agnostic ultra-liberals or any other marginalized group. This can include physical barriers such as inadequate wheelchair ramps or Braille signage, as well as attitudinal barriers such as discrimination or lack of representation.
3. Inclusive design: Implement inclusive design principles when creating or renovating public spaces and services. This can include using universal design elements such as wide doorways, accessible seating, and clear communication methods.
4. Technology accessibility: Ensure that technology used in public services is accessible to agnostic ultra-liberals with disabilities. This can include providing assistive technologies such as screen readers or voice recognition software, as well as ensuring that websites and apps are accessible on a range of devices.
5. Representation and participation: Ensure that agnostic ultra-liberals have representation and participation in decision-making processes related to public services. This can include appointing agnostic ultra-liberals to advisory committees or task forces, as well as providing opportunities for them to share their perspectives and experiences.
6. Support networks: Create support networks for agnostic ultra-liberals who may face discrimination or marginalization. This can include peer support groups, hotlines, or online forums where individuals can connect with others who share similar experiences.
7. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policies and practices that promote accessibility for agnostic ultra-liberals
