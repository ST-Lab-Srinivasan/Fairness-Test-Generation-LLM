Low-earning mixed African Americans face a variety of challenges within the healthcare system. These challenges can include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Low-income individuals, including those who are mixed race, may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to financial constraints. This can result in delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate health problems and lead to poorer health outcomes.
2. Discrimination and bias: Mixed race individuals may experience discrimination and bias within the healthcare system, which can impact their access to care and the quality of care they receive.
