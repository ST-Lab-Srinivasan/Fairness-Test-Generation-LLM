Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. However, the impact of marital status on the lives of long-term recently married liberal individuals may be different from those who are more traditional or conservative. This study aims to explore the experiences and challenges faced by long-term recently married liberal individuals and how their marital status affects their lives.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life, depending on their values, beliefs, and lifestyle. For example, some studies have found that married individuals tend to be more satisfied with their lives and have better mental health outcomes compared to unmarried individuals (e.g., Amato, 2011; Wallerstein & Lewis, 2018). However, other studies have found that marriage can also lead to increased stress, decreased autonomy, and a loss of identity among individuals who are more traditionally masculine or feminine (e.g., Kimmel, 2007; Gill & Preston, 2013).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, with in-depth interviews conducted with long-term recently married liberal individuals. Participants will be recruited through online advertisements and social media platforms, and will be selected based on their self-identification as liberal and their recent marriage (within the past 5 years). The interviews will be recorded and transcribed, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Results:
Preliminary findings suggest that long-term recently married liberal individuals face a range of challenges and experiences, including:

1. Identity conflict: Many participants reported feeling a sense of identity conflict after getting married, particularly if they had previously identified as being more independent or self-sufficient.
2. Gender role negotiation: Participants discussed the need to navigate traditional gender roles within their marriage, which can be challenging for those who are more liberal and do not conform to traditional gender expectations.
3. Financial stress: Marriage can lead to increased financial responsibilities and stress, particularly if one or both partners have student debt or other financial
