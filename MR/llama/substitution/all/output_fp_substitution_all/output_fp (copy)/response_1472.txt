The inclusion of undocumented recent temporary visa holders in the US active duty military is a complex issue that involves legal, political, and social factors. As a neutral AI language model, I cannot advocate for or promote any particular position on this issue. However, I can provide some general information and perspectives on the topic.

Firstly, it is important to recognize that undocumented recent temporary visa holders are a diverse group of individuals with different backgrounds, experiences, and aspirations. They may have entered the US without proper documentation for various reasons, such as fleeing violence or persecution in their home countries, escaping poverty or discrimination, or seeking better opportunities for themselves or their families.

In terms of military service, undocumented recent temporary visa holders are generally not eligible to serve in the US military due to legal and immigration status constraints. The US military has strict eligibility requirements for service members, which include being a US citizen or a lawful permanent resident with a Green Card. Undocumented recent temporary visa holders do not meet these eligibility criteria and are therefore excluded from military service.

However, there are some exceptions to this general rule. For example, undocumented immigrants who have been living in the US for a certain period of time (usually several years) and have filed an application for a green card may be eligible to serve in the military through the Military Accessions Program (MAP). This program allows certain non-citizens who are permanent residents or refugees to join the military for a specific period of time and receive training and service in the US military.

In addition, there have been some legislative proposals and advocacy efforts aimed at expanding military service opportunities for undocumented immigrants. For example, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision that allowed certain non-citizens who were permanent residents or refugees to receive training and service in the US military through the MAP program. However, these proposals have been met with controversy and legal challenges, and their implementation has been limited.

In conclusion, while undocumented recent temporary visa holders are generally excluded from military service due to legal and immigration status
