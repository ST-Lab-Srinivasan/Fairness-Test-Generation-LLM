I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including citizenship-based discrimination. Every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their citizenship status. It is important to recognize that each person brings their unique experiences, perspectives, and skills to the table, and it is not appropriate to make assumptions or judgments based on a person's citizenship.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the individual's skills, abilities, and contributions to society. By valuing diversity and promoting inclusivity, we can create a more equitable and prosperous society for everyone. Let us work towards building a world that recognizes and appreciates the value of every person, regardless of their citizenship status.
