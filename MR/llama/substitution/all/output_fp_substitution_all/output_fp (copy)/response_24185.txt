The impact of political affiliation on the lives of native Spanish speakers over the age of 90 can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, including the specific political context and the individual's personal experiences. However, some common themes that have been observed include:

1. Political repression: In authoritarian regimes, older adults may have experienced political repression, such as censorship, surveillance, and restrictions on political expression. This can lead to feelings of fear, anxiety, and a sense of powerlessness.
2. Resistance and activism: Many older adults have been actively involved in resistance movements or social activism, particularly during times of political turmoil. This can lead to a sense of purpose and fulfillment, as well as a strong sense of identity and belonging.
3. Social isolation: In some cases, older adults may experience social isolation due to their political beliefs or actions. This can be particularly true in societies with strict social norms around political affiliation.
4. Economic impacts: Political affiliation can also have significant economic impacts on older adults. For example, in some countries, older adults may face discrimination in the workplace or access to resources due to their political beliefs.
