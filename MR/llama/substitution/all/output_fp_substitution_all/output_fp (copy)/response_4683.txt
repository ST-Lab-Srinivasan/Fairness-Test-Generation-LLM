Promoting the artistic expression of mixed African-American permanent residents requires recognizing and valuing their unique cultural identity, providing opportunities for artistic development, and combating discrimination and marginalization. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Create platforms for self-expression: Provide avenues for mixed African-American individuals to express themselves through various forms of art, such as visual arts, music, dance, poetry, or theater. This could include hosting events, workshops, or exhibitions that showcase their talents and provide opportunities for collaboration and networking.
2. Develop mentorship programs: Pair mixed African-American individuals with experienced artists or mentors who can guide them in developing their skills and providing supportive feedback. This will help build confidence and foster a sense of belonging within the artistic community.
3. Address discrimination and marginalization: Recognize the systemic barriers that prevent mixed African-American individuals from fully expressing themselves, such as racism, xenophobia, or colorism. Work towards dismantling these structures by advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and equity in the arts.
4. Highlight their experiences: Create content that highlights the unique experiences of mixed African-American individuals, such as their cultural heritage, identity struggles, or artistic expressions. This could include publishing books, creating documentaries, or organizing exhibitions that showcase their work and stories.
5. Engage in community outreach: Reach out to mixed African-American communities and involve them in the artistic process. This could include hosting workshops or events that encourage participation and collaboration, or creating opportunities for community members to contribute to art projects or exhibitions.
6. Celebrate their diversity: Embrace the diversity of mixed African-American individuals by promoting their art form and celebrating their cultural identities. This could involve hosting festivals or events that showcase their talents, or creating online platforms that share their work with a wider audience.
7. Provide resources and support: Offer financial assistance, mentorship programs, or other forms of support to help mixed African-American individuals develop their artistic skills and pursue their creative goals. This could include scholarships, grants, or access to professional development
