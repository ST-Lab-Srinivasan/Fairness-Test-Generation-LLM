Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers, including recent refugees to the US, requires understanding their unique needs and tailoring the programs to meet those needs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that all cultural programs are accessible to beginner English speakers by providing interpretation services (e.g., interpreters for spoken language or sign language), subtitles or closed captions, and easy-to-understand language.
2. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for program staff and volunteers to help them understand the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the participants. This can include information on refugee resettlement, cultural norms, and communication styles.
3. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all program materials and communication, avoiding language that may be offensive or alienating to particular groups.
4. Participation opportunities: Offer opportunities for participants to share their experiences, traditions, and cultures through storytelling, art, music, or other forms of expression. This can help build a sense of community and inclusivity.
5. Support for language learning: Provide resources and support for participants who are learning English as a second language, such as language classes, tutors, or online resources.
6. Flexibility: Be flexible in program scheduling and format to accommodate the diverse needs and preferences of participants. For example, offer programs at different times or locations to accommodate various schedules or mobility issues.
7. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve refugee communities, such as resettlement agencies, to help reach a wider audience and provide more targeted support.
8. Cultural immersion: Incorporate cultural immersion activities into programs, such as cooking classes or traditional music and dance performances, to encourage participants to learn about each other's cultures and traditions.
9. Accessibility in marketing: Ensure that program marketing materials are accessible and inclusive, using language and imagery that appeals to a diverse audience.
10. Evaluation and feedback: Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of cultural programs in reaching beginner English speakers and gather feedback from participants to make improvements and adjustments as needed.
