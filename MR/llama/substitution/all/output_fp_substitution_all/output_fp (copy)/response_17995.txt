1. Inclusive policies: Educational institutions must develop policies that recognize and respect the identities and experiences of trans students. This includes using gender-neutral language in documents and communications, providing gender-appropriate facilities, and allowing students to use their preferred names and pronouns.
2. Training for educators: Teachers and staff must be trained on how to support trans students, including understanding the experiences of trans individuals, recognizing the challenges they face, and responding appropriately to their needs.
