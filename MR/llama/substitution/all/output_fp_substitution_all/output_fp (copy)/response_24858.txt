Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-single long-time active duty military individuals requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Understand the military lifestyle: Military spouses often have to adapt to frequent relocations, long separations, and unpredictable schedules. Make sure your event planning schedule allows for flexibility and doesn't clash with any of their responsibilities or commitments.
