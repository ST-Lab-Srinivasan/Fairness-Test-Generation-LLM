Supporting the civic engagement of moderate conservative Native recent refugees to the US can be done through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide language classes and cultural orientation: Many recent refugees, especially those from non-English speaking countries, may need help learning English and adjusting to American culture. Offering language classes and cultural orientation programs can help them navigate their new environment more effectively.
2. Facilitate access to voting information: Moderate conservative Native recent refugees may have different political beliefs than the average American, but they still have the right to vote. Providing information on how to register to vote, where to vote, and what issues are important to them can help them exercise their franchise effectively.
3. Encourage community involvement: Encouraging recent refugees to get involved in their local communities can help them build connections and networks that can support their civic engagement. This could involve participating in community events, volunteering, or joining local organizations.
4. Offer legal services: Many recent refugees may face legal challenges as they navigate the US immigration system. Providing access to free or low-cost legal services can help them navigate these challenges more effectively and ensure their rights are protected.
5. Promote civic education: Providing educational resources on civics, government, and politics can help recent refugees better understand the US political system and how it works. This could involve offering classes, workshops, or online resources.
6. Facilitate access to healthcare: Recent refugees may face barriers to accessing healthcare, especially if they do not have insurance or are unfamiliar with the US healthcare system. Providing information on how to access affordable healthcare and connecting them with local healthcare providers can help them receive the care they need.
7. Connect them with mentors: Connecting recent refugees with mentors who can provide guidance and support can help them navigate their new environment more effectively. Mentors could be volunteers from the local community or organizations that specialize in supporting refugees.
8. Offer job training and placement services: Many recent refugees may face challenges finding employment due to a lack of connections, language barriers, or unfamiliarity with the US job market. Providing job training and placement services
