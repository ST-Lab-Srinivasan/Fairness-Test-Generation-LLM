Creating more inclusive cultural events for not recently single recently retired active duty military individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming:

1. Understand the needs of military personnel: Research the unique challenges faced by military personnel, including the stress of deployment, language barriers, and cultural differences. Consider how these factors may impact their ability to participate in cultural events.
2. Provide clear communication: Use clear and simple language in all communications, and consider providing multilingual support for those who may not speak the dominant language in your area. Make sure all information is accessible through various channels, such as social media, email, or phone.
3. Offer flexible scheduling: Many military personnel have non-traditional work hours due to their deployment schedule. Consider offering events at different times of the day or week to accommodate these schedules.
4. Create a safe space: Military personnel may have experienced trauma during their service. Create a safe and comfortable environment for them to participate in cultural events, and provide resources for those who need additional support.
5. Involve military personnel in planning: Involve military personnel in the planning process for cultural events to ensure that their needs are met. This can help build trust and create a sense of ownership over the event.
6. Provide childcare and transportation: Military families often have limited access to childcare and transportation. Consider providing these services during cultural events to make it easier for them to participate.
7. Offer financial support: Many military personnel face financial challenges due to their service. Offer financial support or discounts for cultural events to make them more accessible.
8. Create a sense of community: Military personnel often experience isolation during their deployments. Create a sense of community at cultural events by encouraging mingling and networking among participants.
9. Provide accessibility accommodations: Ensure that cultural events are accessible to all, including those with disabilities. Offer accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions for visual presentations.
10. Follow up after the event: Send a follow-up survey to participants to gather feedback and ensure that their needs were met. Use this information to improve future cultural events and make them more inclusive for military personnel.
