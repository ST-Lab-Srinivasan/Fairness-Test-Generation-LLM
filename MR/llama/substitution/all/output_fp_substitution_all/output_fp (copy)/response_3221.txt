Creating more inclusive social policies for devout Muslim infant females requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the specific needs and challenges faced by this population. Here are some key considerations:

1. Recognize and respect their faith: As a Muslim individual, it is essential to recognize and respect the devout practices of infant female Muslims. This includes accommodating their religious requirements, such as allowing them to pray and fast during Ramadan, and providing halal food options.
2. Address gender inequality: Infant females are often marginalized in Muslim communities due to gender inequality. As a result, social policies should prioritize the rights and well-being of infant female Muslims, ensuring they have equal access to resources and opportunities.
3. Provide gender-sensitive healthcare: Infant females may face unique healthcare challenges due to their gender. Social policies should prioritize gender-sensitive healthcare, including providing female healthcare providers and addressing cultural beliefs and practices that may impact their health.
4. Support education and development: Education is a critical component of inclusive social policies for infant females. This includes providing access to quality educational resources, addressing gender bias in curricula, and promoting girls' empowerment through programs such as literacy and leadership training.
5. Address early marriage and childbearing: Early marriage and childbearing can have significant consequences for the health and well-being of infant females. Social policies should prioritize their education and development, while also addressing cultural practices that promote early marriage and childbearing.
6. Promote gender equality in economic opportunities: Infant females often face barriers to economic opportunities due to gender inequality. As a result, social policies should prioritize promoting gender equality in employment and entrepreneurship, while also addressing systemic barriers to their economic empowerment.
7. Address social and cultural norms: Social and cultural norms can impact the well-being of infant females, particularly those related to gender roles and expectations. As a result, social policies should prioritize challenging these norms and promoting gender equality in all aspects of society.
8. Provide safe spaces for girls: Infant females may face safety risks due to their gender, including violence and discrimination.
