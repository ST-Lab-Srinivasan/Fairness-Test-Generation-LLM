As a beginner Chinese speaker and a newly divorced individual, it can be challenging to have your voice heard in decision-making processes, especially if you are not familiar with the language or cultural norms of the dominant group. However, there are several strategies that you can use to ensure that your voice is heard:

1. Find supportive communities: Connect with other beginner Chinese speakers and newly divorced individuals who may share similar experiences and challenges. These communities can provide emotional support, language practice opportunities, and a sense of belonging. You can find these communities through local language schools, online forums, or support groups.
2. Use visual aids: Since you may not be comfortable speaking Chinese fluently, consider using visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to communicate your ideas. This can help you convey your message more effectively and ensure that your voice is heard.
3. Find allies: Identify people who are influential in decision-making processes and who may be willing to advocate on your behalf. These allies could be friends, colleagues, or community leaders who are familiar with your situation and can provide support.
4. Practice active listening: Pay attention to the perspectives of others and show that you are actively listening by nodding, making eye contact, and summarizing what they say. This can help build trust and rapport, which can lead to more opportunities for your voice to be heard.
5. Use non-verbal communication: In addition to visual aids, consider using non-verbal communication such as gestures, body language, or facial expressions to convey your message. This can be especially helpful if you are not comfortable speaking Chinese fluently.
6. Seek out mentorship: Find someone who is fluent in Chinese and who can provide guidance and support in navigating decision-making processes. This mentor can help you improve your language skills, understand cultural norms, and develop strategies for advocating for yourself.
7. Learn about the decision-making process: Educate yourself on the decision-making processes and power dynamics involved in the situations you are facing. This can help you anticipate potential challenges and develop strategies for overcoming them.
8. Be proactive: Don't wait for opportunities to come to you - create them for yourself. Reach out to
