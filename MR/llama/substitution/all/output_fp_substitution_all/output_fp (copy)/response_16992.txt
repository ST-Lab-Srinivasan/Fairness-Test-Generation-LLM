Creating more inclusive cultural programs for non-sexual ex-spouse individuals requires understanding and acknowledging the unique challenges they face. Here are some suggestions to help make cultural programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that all ex-spouses identify as LGBTQ+ or have similar experiences. Be mindful of this and create programming that is inclusive of all non-sexual ex-spouse individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
2. Involve them in the planning process: Consult with non-sexual ex-spouse individuals to understand their needs and preferences when designing cultural programs. This will help create programs that are tailored to their interests and comfort levels.
3. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials and workshops on topics such as understanding non-binary identities, gender expression, and sexuality. This can help ex-spouses feel more comfortable and included in cultural programs.
4. Create safe spaces: Designate areas or events within cultural programs where non-sexual ex-spouse individuals can feel safe and comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or harassment.
5. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes a binary gender identity or implies that sexuality is the only factor that defines a person's identity. Instead, use language that acknowledges and respects non-binary identities and experiences.
6. Showcase diverse voices: Include programming that highlights the stories and experiences of non-sexual ex-spouse individuals from diverse backgrounds and communities. This can help create a more inclusive and representative cultural environment.
7. Offer gender-neutral options: Provide options for individuals who may not identify with traditional gender categories, such as gender-neutral clothing or bathroom facilities.
8. Foster a culture of respect: Encourage all participants to treat each other with respect and dignity, regardless of their gender identity or expression. This can help create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for non-sexual ex-spouse individuals.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical power imbalances that may exist between different marginalized communities, and take steps to address these issues within cultural programs.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve
