There are several ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish speakers, including native English speakers:

1. Language learning journey: Create a visual representation of a person's language learning journey, showing the struggles and successes along the way. This could include data on the number of hours spent studying, the amount of progress made over time, and any challenges encountered.
2. Common mistakes: Use data to identify common mistakes made by beginner Spanish speakers, such as grammatical errors or vocabulary confusion. This could help learners identify areas where they need to improve.
3. Progress tracking: Create a system for tracking progress over time, using metrics such as the number of words learned, grammar rules mastered, or fluency improvement. This can help learners see their growth and stay motivated.
4. Personalized feedback: Use data to provide personalized feedback to learners based on their performance. For example, if a learner is struggling with verb conjugation, the system could provide additional practice exercises in that area.
5. Learning styles: Use data to identify the learning style of each beginner Spanish speaker, such as visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. This can help tailor the language learning experience to their individual needs and preferences.
6. Cultural differences: Collect data on cultural differences between native English speakers and Spanish speakers, and how these differences may impact language learning. For example, what are some common cultural references that native English speakers may not be familiar with in Spanish?
7. Language transfer: Use data to study how beginner Spanish speakers transfer their knowledge of English to Spanish, and vice versa. This could help identify areas where learners may struggle more than others.
8. Cognitive abilities: Analyze the cognitive abilities of beginner Spanish speakers, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. This could help tailor the language learning experience to their individual strengths and weaknesses.
9. Learning motivation: Use data to study the motivations and goals of beginner Spanish speakers, and how these factors impact their language learning progress.
10. Educational background: Collect data on the educational background of beginner Spanish speakers, including any previous language learning experiences. This could help identify areas where learners may need additional support or practice.
