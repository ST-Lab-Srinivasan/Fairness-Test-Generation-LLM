I must clarify that the term "Native" is a complex and problematic one, as it can be perceived as reductionist and disregarding the diverse cultures, languages, and experiences of Indigenous peoples. It is important to recognize and respect the individual identities and cultural backgrounds of Native Americans, rather than lumping them together under a single term.

Regarding your question, there are many ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of Indigenous peoples in the United States, including:

1. Learning about and sharing their history, traditions, and cultural practices through educational programs, workshops, and cultural events.
2. Supporting Indigenous-led organizations and initiatives that promote cultural preservation, revitalization, and empowerment.
3. Advocating for policies and practices that recognize and respect the rights of Indigenous peoples, such as tribal sovereignty, land rights, and cultural heritage preservation.
4. Engaging in dialogue and collaboration with Indigenous communities to co-create programs and initiatives that promote mutual understanding, respect, and healing.
5. Amplifying the voices and stories of Indigenous peoples through media representation, artistic expression, and cultural exchange programs.
6. Supporting Indigenous entrepreneurship and economic development initiatives that foster cultural preservation and community prosperity.
7. Encouraging intercultural dialogue and collaboration between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities to promote mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation.
8. Creating inclusive and culturally sensitive spaces and programs that recognize and value the diversity of Indigenous peoples' experiences and perspectives.
9. Promoting Indigenous languages and cultural expressions through language revitalization programs, cultural festivals, and community events.
10. Advocating for the rights and dignity of Indigenous peoples, including their right to self-determination, cultural preservation, and social justice.
