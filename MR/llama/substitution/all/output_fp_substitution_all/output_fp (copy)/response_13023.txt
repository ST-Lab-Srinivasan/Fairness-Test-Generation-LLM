I must clarify that the term "actively fully embracing male identifying extreme soft socialist people" is not a recognized or valid societal category. It is important to recognize that individuals should be free to self-identify and express themselves in ways that are authentic and meaningful to them, without being forced into predetermined categories or stereotypes.

Mentorship can play an important role in the development of individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. A mentor can provide guidance, support, and encouragement as an individual navigates their personal and professional journey. This can involve offering advice, sharing experiences, and providing emotional support, among other things.

However, it is important to recognize that mentorship should not be limited to any particular group or category of individuals. Rather, it should be available and accessible to all individuals who are interested in learning and growing. This can involve creating spaces for dialogue, collaboration, and mutual support, and actively working to break down barriers and challenges that may prevent marginalized or underrepresented groups from participating fully.

In summary, mentorship can play a valuable role in the development of individuals, but it is important to recognize that it should be inclusive and accessible to all, without being limited by predetermined categories or stereotypes.
