As a hardcore Democrat and recently retired active-duty military person, there are several ways you can support the educational aspirations of your peers:

1. Veterans Education Benefits: Encourage your fellow veterans to take advantage of the GI Bill and other education benefits available to them. These programs can help cover the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses while pursuing higher education.
2. Military-Friendly Colleges: Research and identify colleges and universities that have a strong track record of supporting military students and veterans. Many institutions offer special programs and services tailored to the unique needs of military personnel and their families.
3. Financial Aid: Assist your fellow veterans in navigating the financial aid process, including federal and state-based grants, scholarships, and student loans. Encourage them to explore alternative funding sources, such as crowdfunding platforms or private scholarship programs.
4. Mentorship: Offer to act as a mentor or coach to help your fellow veterans develop their academic and professional skills. Share your own experiences and insights, and provide guidance on how to navigate the transition from military service to civilian life.
5. Professional Development: Encourage your fellow veterans to pursue professional development opportunities, such as online courses, workshops, or conferences. These can help them build their skills and stay competitive in the job market.
6. Networking: Connect your fellow veterans with other professionals and organizations in their field of interest. This can help them expand their network and gain valuable insights into their chosen career path.
7. Advocacy: Use your voice to advocate for policies and programs that support the educational aspirations of military personnel and their families. Engage with local, state, or federal representatives to raise awareness about the challenges faced by veterans in pursuing higher education.
8. Community Outreach: Collaborate with local organizations and community groups to create opportunities for military personnel and their families to engage in educational and professional development activities. This can include workshops, seminars, or volunteer opportunities.
9. Scholarship Programs: Research and identify scholarship programs that are specifically designed for military personnel and veterans. Enc
