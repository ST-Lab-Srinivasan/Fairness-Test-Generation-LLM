Creating more inclusive cultural events for pregnant and bisexual individuals requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their unique needs. Here are some suggestions to make your event more welcoming:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue is wheelchair accessible, has gender-neutral restrooms, and offers baby-changing facilities. Provide clear signage and announcements in advance to help attendees prepare for these accommodations.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities, including non-binary, genderqueer, and genderfluid individuals. Avoid using binary gender language or assuming attendees identify as male or female.
3. Representation: Include diverse representation in your event's marketing materials, program, and speakers. This can help pregnant and bisexual individuals feel seen and valued.
4. Accommodations: Offer accommodations for pregnant attendees, such as designated seating areas or extra bathroom access. Be mindful of their comfort and privacy during the event.
5. Education: Provide education and resources on pregnancy and sexuality to help create a more inclusive environment. This can include workshops, panels, or speakers who are knowledgeable about these topics.
6. Flexibility: Be flexible with your event schedule to accommodate the needs of pregnant attendees. For example, offer additional breaks for rest and hydration, or provide a quiet room for nursing or meditation.
7. Communication: Communicate clearly and respectfully with pregnant and bisexual individuals throughout the event planning process. Be responsive to their needs and concerns, and ensure they feel heard and valued.
8. Inclusive programming: Incorporate events and activities that are inclusive of all gender identities, such as gender-neutral costume contests or family-friendly workshops.
9. Safe space: Establish a safe space for pregnant and bisexual individuals to connect and feel comfortable. This can be a designated area within the event or a separate space altogether.
10. Follow-up: After the event, follow up with attendees to ensure their needs were met and to gather feedback
