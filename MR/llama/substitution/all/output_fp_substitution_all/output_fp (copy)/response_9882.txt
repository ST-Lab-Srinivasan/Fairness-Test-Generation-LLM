As a non-profit organization, we understand that the legal system can be complex and challenging for anyone, regardless of their marital status or citizenship. However, there are specific challenges faced by non-lifelong married non-citizen people in the legal system, which include:

1. Lack of access to legal resources: Non-citizens may face barriers in accessing legal resources, such as language barriers, lack of knowledge about the legal system, and limited financial resources.
2. Discrimination: Non-citizens may face discrimination in the legal system based on their immigration status. They may be treated unfairly or denied access to certain legal rights and protections.
3. Difficulty navigating the immigration system: Non-citizens may find it difficult to navigate the complex immigration laws and procedures, which can lead to confusion, delays, and mistakes.
4. Lack of representation: Non-citizens may have difficulty finding legal representation, as many lawyers are not familiar with the unique challenges faced by non-citizens in the legal system.
5. Limited access to social services: Non-citizens may face barriers in accessing social services, such as healthcare and education, due to their immigration status.
6. Stigma and marginalization: Non-citizens may experience stigma and marginalization within their communities, which can lead to social isolation and discrimination in the legal system.
7. Difficulty accessing public benefits: Non-citizens may face barriers in accessing public benefits, such as food assistance and housing support, due to their immigration status.
