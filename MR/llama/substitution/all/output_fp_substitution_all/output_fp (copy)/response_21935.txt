Ensuring the educational needs of active-duty Native natural-born US citizen students can be challenging due to various factors, including cultural and linguistic barriers, lack of resources, and discrimination. Here are some strategies that can help meet their educational needs:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training for educators on culturally responsive teaching practices that acknowledge and respect the unique cultural backgrounds of Native students. This can involve incorporating traditional ecological knowledge, stories, and language into the curriculum.
