As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "deeply lower-class" is not a recognized social or economic category in the United States.

However, I can provide some general information about the challenges faced by Native American communities in the healthcare system in the US:

1. Access to care: Native Americans often face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to a lack of healthcare providers in their communities, cultural and language barriers, and geographic isolation. Many rural Native American communities are located far from urban areas with access to specialized medical care.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Native American communities have unique cultural practices and beliefs that can affect their healthcare experiences. Healthcare providers must be culturally sensitive and aware of these differences to provide appropriate care.
