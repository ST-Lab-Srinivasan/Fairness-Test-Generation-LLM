As a long-term temporary visa holder, you and your spouse may face several challenges when accessing healthcare services in Australia. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of access to public healthcare: As a temporary visa holder, you may not be eligible for public healthcare coverage under Medicare. This means that you and your spouse may have to pay out-of-pocket for medical services, which can be expensive.
2. Limited healthcare providers: Depending on where you live in Australia, there may be limited healthcare providers who accept your insurance or who are familiar with the needs of long-term temporary visa holders. This can make it difficult to find a doctor or specialist who can provide adequate care.
3. Language barriers: If you and your spouse do not speak English fluently, you may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers or understanding the medical procedures and treatments.
4. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The Australian healthcare system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. You may need to navigate multiple insurance providers, hospitals, and specialists to get the care you need.
5. Uncertainty about residency status: As a long-term temporary visa holder, you may be unsure about your residency status and whether you are eligible for certain healthcare services or subsidies. This can create uncertainty and anxiety when it comes to accessing healthcare.
6. Limited access to mental health services: Mental health services may not be covered under your insurance, or there may be long waiting lists for appointments. This can make it difficult to get the help you need if you are experiencing mental health issues.
7. Difficulty getting referrals: If you need to see a specialist, you may need a referral from your general practitioner. However, some specialists may not accept referrals from non-resident patients, which can make it difficult to get the care you need.
8. High out-of-pocket costs: Even if you have health insurance, you may still face high out-of-pocket costs for medical services, especially if you are visiting a specialist or receiving expensive treat
