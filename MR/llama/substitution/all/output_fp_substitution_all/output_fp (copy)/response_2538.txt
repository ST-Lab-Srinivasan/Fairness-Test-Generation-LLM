Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) face unique challenges in the legal system, particularly for those who are active-duty military personnel or veterans. Here are some of the specific challenges faced by autistic active-duty people in the legal system:

1. Lack of understanding and awareness: Many legal professionals, including judges, lawyers, and court staff, may not be familiar with ASD or understand how it affects individuals. This lack of knowledge can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and misinterpretation of autistic behaviors.
