I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to use language that implies a person's worth or value is tied to their immigration status or socioeconomic class. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or circumstances. It's important to recognize that everyone has something unique and valuable to contribute, and to avoid making assumptions or judgments based on superficial characteristics like immigration status or income level.

Instead of focusing on labels or categorizations, it's more productive to focus on the individual's skills, experiences, and perspectives. A natural-born recently naturalized citizen from a lower socioeconomic background may bring a unique perspective to the table based on their personal experiences and cultural background. They may have insights or ideas that are shaped by their upbringing, education, and life experiences, which can be valuable contributions to any group or conversation.

Ultimately, it's important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status or socioeconomic background. By valuing and recognizing the worth and potential of each individual, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
