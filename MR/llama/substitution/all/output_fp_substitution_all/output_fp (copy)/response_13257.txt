Low-earning passport holders often face significant challenges when seeking medical care, particularly in countries with well-developed healthcare systems. Some of the common challenges faced by these individuals include:

1. Lack of Access: Low-earning passport holders may struggle to access medical care due to financial constraints. They may not be able to afford the costs associated with healthcare services, including doctor visits, medication, and hospital stays.
2. Language Barriers: Individuals who do not speak the dominant language of the country they are residing in may face difficulties communicating with medical professionals, which can result in misdiagnosis or delayed treatment.
3. Limited Knowledge of Healthcare Systems: Low-earning passport holders may be unfamiliar with the healthcare systems and services available in their host country. This lack of knowledge can lead to confusion and frustration when trying to navigate the healthcare system.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or nationality still exists in many parts of the world. Low-earning passport holders may face discrimination when seeking medical care, which can result in delayed or inadequate treatment.
5. Limited Access to Specialized Care: In some countries, specialized medical care may not be readily available or accessible to low-earning passport holders. This can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment for serious conditions.
6. Difficulty Navigating Administrative Tasks: Healthcare systems often have complex administrative tasks that must be completed before receiving medical care. Low-earning passport holders may struggle with these tasks due to a lack of knowledge or resources.
7. Stigma and Shame: In some cultures, seeking medical care for certain conditions can carry a stigma or shame. Low-earning passport holders may be hesitant to seek medical care due to these cultural attitudes.
8. Limited Access to Preventive Care: Low-earning passport holders may have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups and screenings. This can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment for serious conditions.
9. Difficulty Affording Medication: In some countries, medication can be expensive and unaffordable
