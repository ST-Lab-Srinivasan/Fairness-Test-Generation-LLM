There are several challenges that non-wealthy, non-millionaire native Chinese speakers may face in the legal system:

1. Language barriers: Legal documents and proceedings are often written in English or other languages, which can create a barrier for individuals who are not fluent in these languages. This can make it difficult for them to understand their rights and obligations, as well as to navigate the legal system.
2. Lack of legal resources: Non-wealthy individuals may not have access to the same legal resources as wealthier individuals, such as legal aid organizations or private law firms. This can make it more difficult for them to obtain legal representation or advice.
3. Limited knowledge of the legal system: Many non-wealthy native Chinese speakers may have limited knowledge of the legal system and its processes, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the system effectively.
4. Discrimination: Non-wealthy individuals may face discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they are from a marginalized group. This can include racial or ethnic discrimination, as well as discrimination based on socioeconomic status.
5. Limited access to justice: Non-wealthy individuals may have limited access to justice due to various reasons such as lack of legal resources, language barriers, and discrimination. This can result in unequal access to the legal system and unequal treatment under the law.
6. Lack of political power: Non-wealthy individuals may have limited political power and influence, which can make it difficult for them to advocate for their rights and interests in the legal system.
7. Limited access to legal aid: Many non-wealthy individuals may not have access to legal aid organizations or other resources that can provide them with free or low-cost legal assistance. This can make it difficult for them to obtain legal representation or advice.
8. Lack of cultural competency: Legal system may not be culturally competent to handle the needs of non-wealthy native Chinese speakers, which can result in misunderstandings and miscommunications.
9. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods: Non-wealthy individuals may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation or arbitration, which can be less expensive and less time-consuming than going to court.
