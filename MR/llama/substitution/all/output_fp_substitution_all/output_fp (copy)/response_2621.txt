Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Long-Term, Recently Divorced Native French Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals. It encompasses the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society. For long-term, recently divorced native French speaker individuals, cultural heritage can have a profound impact on their sense of self and belonging. This paper aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of this demographic.

 Literature Review:
The concept of identity is complex and multifaceted, and cultural heritage is a significant factor in shaping it (Hall, 1980).

Participants reported feeling a strong connection to their cultural heritage, particularly when faced with uncertainty and change. This connection was rooted in shared values, custom
