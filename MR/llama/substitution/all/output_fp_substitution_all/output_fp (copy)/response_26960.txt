The impact of immigration status on the lives of moderately and strongly exclusive transgender people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Transgender individuals face unique healthcare challenges, including discrimination, lack of knowledgeable providers, and inadequate insurance coverage. For those with precarious immigration status, accessing necessary medical care may be even more difficult, potentially leading to delayed or foregone care, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
2. Employment and Financial Stability: Transgender individuals are often at a higher risk of unemployment and poverty due to discrimination, stigma, and barriers in the workplace. Moderately and strongly exclusive transgender people may face even more challenges in finding and maintaining stable employment, particularly if they lack legal status or face exploitation by unscrupulous employers.

Moderately and strongly exclusive transgender people may be more vulnerable to these issues due to their immigration status, which can limit their access to affordable and secure housing options.
