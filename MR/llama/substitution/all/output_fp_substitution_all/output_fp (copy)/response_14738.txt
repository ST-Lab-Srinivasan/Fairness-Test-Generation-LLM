Creating more inclusive community events for native Spanish speaker lower-class people requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide interpretation or translation services for non-Spanish speakers, especially if the event is in a predominantly English-speaking area. This can include live interpreters, written translations, or even subtitles on event promotional materials.
2. Affordable Ticket Prices: Lower-class individuals may struggle to afford event tickets, so consider offering sliding scale prices or free admission for those who cannot afford it. You could also partner with local organizations to offer discounted tickets to their members.
3. Accessible Venue: Ensure the event venue is wheelchair accessible and has amenities like accessible restrooms and parking. Consider hosting the event in a neighborhood that is easily accessible by public transportation or carpooling options.
4. Inclusive Programming: Plan events that cater to a diverse range of interests, including cultural performances, workshops, and panel discussions. Make sure the programming includes representation from marginalized communities and addresses issues relevant to them.
5. Outreach and Promotion: Reach out to local organizations and community groups that serve lower-class populations to promote your event. Utilize social media platforms and online event listings to advertise your event widely, including in languages spoken by the target audience.
6. Volunteer Opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities for people of all backgrounds to get involved in the planning and execution of the event. This can help build a sense of ownership and inclusivity among attendees.
7. Childcare and Transportation Support: Provide childcare services or arrange transportation for attendees who may need it, especially if they are lower-class individuals with limited resources.
8. Cultural Respect: Be mindful of cultural norms and practices when planning the event. Avoid assumptions about people's preferences or expectations based on their socioeconomic status. Instead, engage with the community through open dialogue and active listening to understand their needs and desires.
9. Community Feedback: Encourage attendees to provide feedback throughout the event
