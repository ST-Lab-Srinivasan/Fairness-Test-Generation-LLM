The impact of military status on the lives of recently married, multiple times, mid-50s individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Career Disruptions: Military service can disrupt a person's career, particularly if they are in their mid-50s. This can lead to a loss of momentum in their professional life, which may impact their earning potential and retirement savings.
