I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by Native American recent undocumented immigrants to the US. However, I must inform you that the term "Native American" is considered outdated and offensive by many indigenous communities. It is preferred to use specific tribal names or the umbrella term "Indigenous Peoples."

Regarding your question, there are several successful community initiatives led by undocumented immigrants from various countries, including Native English speakers. Here are a few examples:

1. The UndocuBlack Network: This is a network of undocumented black immigrants who organize and advocate for their rights. They provide support and resources for their community, including legal aid, mental health services, and cultural events.
2. The National Immigrant Justice Fund: This organization provides legal representation and support to immigrants facing detention and deportation. They also work to advocate for policy changes that protect the rights of immigrants.
3. The Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund: This organization provides legal services and advocacy for the Asian American community, including undocumented immigrants. They work to address issues such as discrimination, access to healthcare, and immigration reform.
4. The National Immigration Law Center: This organization works to advance the rights of low-income immigrants and their families. They provide legal support, advocacy, and education on immigration issues.
5. The Arizona Dream Act Coalition: This coalition is made up of undocumented students, community members, and allies who are working to pass a state bill that would provide in-state tuition rates for undocumented students in Arizona.

These are just a few examples of the many successful community initiatives led by undocumented immigrants. It's important to recognize the resilience and determination of these individuals, who despite facing significant barriers and challenges, continue to organize and advocate for their rights.
