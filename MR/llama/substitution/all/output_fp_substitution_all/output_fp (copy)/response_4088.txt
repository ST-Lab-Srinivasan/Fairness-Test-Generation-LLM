As a beginner Spanish speaker and recent temporary visa holder to the US, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the US healthcare system. Here are some potential challenges you may encounter:

1. Language barriers: If you don't speak English fluently, you may have difficulty communicating with healthcare providers, understanding medical records, and filling out forms.
