Promoting social inclusion of non-high-income early pregnancy communities requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various aspects of their lives. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that these communities have access to quality and affordable healthcare, including prenatal care, delivery, and postnatal care. This can be achieved by setting up health clinics in underserved areas, partnering with local hospitals, or providing financial assistance for medical expenses.
2. Education and Awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops on pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. Topics could include nutrition, prenatal care, and postnatal care. This can be done through community centers, schools, or community events.
3. Support Groups: Facilitate the creation of support groups for pregnant women and new mothers in these communities. These groups can provide a safe space for sharing experiences, asking questions, and receiving emotional support.
4. Community Outreach: Engage with local communities through outreach programs, events, or partnerships with community organizations. This can help build trust and increase awareness of available resources.
5. Advocacy: Advocate for policies that address the social and economic barriers faced by these communities. This could include advocating for affordable housing, access to food and other basic necessities, and fair labor practices.
6. Economic Empowerment: Provide training and resources to help women in these communities start or grow their own businesses. This can help increase their financial stability and independence.
7. Childcare Support: Offer childcare services or support for families, allowing parents to pursue education or job opportunities without worrying about childcare responsibilities.
8. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in decision-making processes related to healthcare, education, and social welfare. This can help build a sense of ownership and accountability among community members.
9. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Partner with local organizations that work with these communities, such as community centers, schools, or non-profit organizations. This can help leverage resources and expertise to achieve common goals.
