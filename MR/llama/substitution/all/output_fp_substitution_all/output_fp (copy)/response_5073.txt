The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of young non-binary people who are Native recent refugees to the US can be significant and far-reaching. These individuals may face a range of challenges, including:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: Many Native communities have limited access to healthcare services, including genetic testing and treatment. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care for individuals with genetic conditions, which can exacerbate their symptoms and impact their quality of life.
2. Cultural barriers: Genetic conditions may be viewed differently within Native communities, and individuals may face cultural barriers when seeking medical care. For example, some Native communities may have traditional healing practices that conflict with Western medical approaches to genetic conditions.
3. Discrimination: Non-binary individuals may face discrimination and stigma based on their gender identity, which can impact their mental health and well-being. This can be particularly challenging for young people who are still developing their sense of self and identity.
4. Social isolation: Native recent refugees may experience social isolation due to language barriers, cultural differences, or discrimination. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from community, which can impact mental health and overall well-being.
5. Trauma: Many Native individuals have experienced trauma related to violence, displacement, or cultural suppression. This trauma can impact mental health and well-being, and may be exacerbated by the stress of resettlement in a new country.
6. Stigma around mental health: Mental health issues are often stigmatized within Native communities, which can make it difficult for individuals to seek help or disclose their struggles with others.
7. Limited access to resources: Young non-binary people who are Native recent refugees may face limited access to resources such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. This can impact their ability to manage their genetic condition and achieve their goals.
8. Identity issues: Non-binary individuals may struggle with their identity and sense of self, which can be further complicated by cultural and societal expectations around gender.
9. Lack of representation: Young non-binary people who are Native recent refugees may feel invisible or underrepresented in media, politics, and other areas
