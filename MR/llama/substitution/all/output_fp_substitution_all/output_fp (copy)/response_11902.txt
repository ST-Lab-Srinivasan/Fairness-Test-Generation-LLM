The term "deeply lower-class" is relative and can vary depending on the context and perspective. However, in general, it refers to individuals who are living in poverty or near poverty conditions, facing significant barriers to economic mobility and stability. To support the economic empowerment of these individuals, here are some strategies that can be implemented:

2. Entrepreneurship support: Encourage entrepreneurship by providing resources and support for starting and growing small businesses. This can include access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
3. Job placement services: Offer job placement services that connect individuals with available jobs in their community or within their desired field. This can help bridge the gap between unemployment and economic stability.
4. Financial inclusion: Promote financial inclusion by providing access to affordable financial services, such as bank accounts, credit unions, and microfinance programs. This can help individuals save money, manage expenses, and build credit.
5. Healthcare and wellness services: Ensure access to quality healthcare and wellness services that address the unique needs of Native communities. This can include on-reservation clinics, telemedicine services, and mental health support.
6. Housing and infrastructure development: Invest in affordable housing and community infrastructure, such as roads, schools, and community centers. This can help create a stable living environment and promote economic growth.
7. Community development programs: Support community-led initiatives that foster economic development, cultural preservation, and social cohesion. Examples include cooperative businesses, farmers' markets, and cultural festivals.
8. Advocacy and policy support: Advocate for policies that address systemic barriers to economic empowerment, such as inadequate funding for Native American programs, discriminatory hiring practices, and lack of access to capital.
