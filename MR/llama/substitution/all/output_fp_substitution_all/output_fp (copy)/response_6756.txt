As an AI language model, I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or marginalization, including those based on sexual orientation. Everyone deserves respect and inclusion, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

To create more inclusive cultural programs for asexual individuals, you can consider the following steps:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the asexual community and their experiences to better understand their needs and preferences.
2. Involve asexual individuals in the planning process: Consult with asexual individuals to ensure that their perspectives are considered and included in the cultural programs.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is sexual or cisgender, and use language that is inclusive of all gender identities.
4. Provide options for non-binary attendees: Offer gender-neutral options for attendees who do not identify as male or female, such as using they/them pronouns or creating a separate category for non-binary attendees.
5. Be mindful of representation: Ensure that the cultural programs include representation from diverse backgrounds and identities, including asexual individuals.
6. Foster an inclusive environment: Create a safe and welcoming space for all attendees, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
7. Collaborate with asexual organizations: Partner with organizations that support asexual individuals to help promote the cultural programs and ensure their involvement.
8. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for asexual attendees who may need them, such as avoiding explicit sexual content or providing gender-neutral options for food and drinks.
9. Be respectful: Respect the identities and experiences of asexual individuals, and avoid making assumptions about their sexual orientation or gender identity.
10. Continuously improve: Continuously gather feedback from asexual attendees and make improvements to ensure that the cultural programs are inclusive and welcoming for everyone.

By following these steps, you can create more inclusive cultural programs for exclusively strongly asexual long-term recently divorced individuals and other marginalized groups.
