The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of children in lower middle-income countries can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Stigma and social isolation: Children with genetic conditions may face stigma and discrimination from their peers, family members, and even healthcare providers. This can lead to social isolation, which can have a negative impact on their mental health and well-being.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Children in lower middle-income countries may not have access to the same level of medical care as those in higher-income countries. This can make it more difficult to diagnose and manage genetic conditions, which can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment.
3. Financial burden: Families of children with genetic conditions may face significant financial burdens due to the cost of medical care, treatments, and therapies. This can be particularly challenging for families in lower middle-income countries where resources are already limited.
4. Impact on education: Children with genetic conditions may face difficulties in school due to their condition, which can impact their academic performance and social interactions. They may also miss out on educational opportunities due to frequent hospitalizations or medical appointments.
5. Limited opportunities for independent living: Children with severe genetic conditions may have limited independence as adults, requiring ongoing support and care from family members or caregivers. This can limit their ability to pursue their own goals and dreams.
6. Psychological impact: Living with a genetic condition can have a significant psychological impact on children, including anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. They may also experience feelings of isolation and loneliness.
7. Limited access to support services: Children in lower middle-income countries may not have access to the same level of support services as those in higher-income countries, such as counseling, therapy, or support groups. This can make it more difficult for them to cope with the emotional challenges of living with a genetic condition.
8. Limited opportunities for employment: As adults, individuals with severe genetic conditions may face limitations in their ability to find and keep employment due to their condition. This can impact their independence and quality of life.
