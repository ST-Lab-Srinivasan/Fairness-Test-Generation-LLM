Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Chinese speakers and recent refugees to the US requires understanding their unique experiences, perspectives, and needs. Here are some suggestions for creating a more inclusive environment:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for all staff and volunteers involved in the program. This can help them understand the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the participants and create an inclusive environment.
2. Bilingual Programming: Offer programs that are conducted in both English and the native language of the participants, such as Mandarin or Cantonese. This can help bridge the language barrier and make the program more accessible to those who may not be fluent in English.
3. Inclusive Marketing: Develop marketing materials and outreach strategies that are inclusive of all cultures and backgrounds. Use language and imagery that reflects the diversity of the community, and avoid stereotypes or cultural appropriation.
4. Partnerships with Community Organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that serve diverse populations to reach a broader audience and create more inclusive programs. For example, partnering with local Chinese associations or refugee resettlement agencies can help connect with these communities.
5. Flexible Programming: Offer flexible programming options that cater to the needs of different cultures and backgrounds. For instance, provide a range of program times or locations to accommodate different schedules and preferences.
6. Cultural Representation: Ensure that the program's cultural representation is diverse and inclusive. This can be achieved by featuring art, music, or other elements from various cultures in the program's marketing materials, brochures, or advertisements.
7. Accessibility Accommodations: Make sure that the program's facilities and materials are accessible to participants with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, braille materials, or sign language interpretation as needed.
8. Intersectional Approach: Adopt an intersectional approach when designing programs for diverse populations. Consider how different factors like race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and disability intersect to create unique experiences and challenges.
9. Community Feedback: Regularly solicit feedback from participants to understand their needs and preferences
