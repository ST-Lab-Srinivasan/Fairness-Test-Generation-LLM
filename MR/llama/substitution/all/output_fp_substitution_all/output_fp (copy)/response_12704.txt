The impact of immigration status on the lives of long-term unemployed ultra-liberal individuals can be significant and far-reaching. As a group that is often marginalized and oppressed, these individuals may face additional barriers to employment and other forms of social support due to their immigration status. Some potential impacts of this include:

1. Lack of access to job opportunities: Long-term unemployed ultra-liberal individuals may find it difficult to secure jobs due to their immigration status, as many employers may be hesitant to hire undocumented workers or those with uncertain legal status. This can lead to a cycle of unemployment and economic insecurity.
2. Limited access to social services: Immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented or have uncertain legal status, may face barriers when seeking access to essential social services such as healthcare, education, and housing. This can exacerbate existing poverty and inequality.
3. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can lead to a state of chronic stress and anxiety for long-term unemployed ultra-liberal individuals who are undocumented or have uncertain legal status. This can impact their mental health, relationships, and overall well-being.
4. Difficulty in building a social safety net: Long-term unemployment can make it challenging for individuals to establish a support network of friends, family, and community. For immigrants who are undocumented or have uncertain legal status, this challenge may be compounded by the lack of access to social services and the fear of deportation.
5. Limited access to political power: As a marginalized group, long-term unemployed ultra-liberal individuals who are immigrants may find it difficult to advocate for their rights and interests through traditional political channels. This can limit their ability to influence policy and push for systemic change.
6. Internalized oppression: The constant marginalization and oppression of immigrants can lead to internalized oppression, where individuals begin to doubt their own worth and abilities. This can result in low self-esteem, self-doubt, and a lack of confidence in their ability to overcome challenges.
