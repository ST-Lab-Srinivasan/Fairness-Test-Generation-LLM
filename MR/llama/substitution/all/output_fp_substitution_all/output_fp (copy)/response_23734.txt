Ensuring that the healthcare needs of recent green card holders, particularly those from lower-income backgrounds, are met in the United States requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Expand Medicaid Coverage: Recent green card holders who are low-income individuals may be eligible for Medicaid coverage in their first five years in the US. Expanding Medicaid coverage to include these individuals can help ensure they have access to necessary healthcare services.
2. Community Health Centers: Community health centers (CHCs) provide comprehensive primary care services to underserved populations, including low-income individuals and immigrants. Increasing funding for CHCs can help provide more accessible healthcare services to recent green card holders.
3. Non-Profit Organizations: Many non-profit organizations, such as the National Association of Free & Charitable Clinics (NAFC), provide healthcare services to underserved populations, including low-income individuals and immigrants. Supporting these organizations through donations or volunteering can help bridge the gap in healthcare access for recent green card holders.
4. Public Education Campaigns: Conducting public education campaigns in languages spoken by recent green card holders can help raise awareness about available healthcare resources, including Medicaid, CHCs, and non-profit organizations. This can help increase access to healthcare services for this population.

Health Fairs & Outreach Events: Organizing health fairs and outreach events in communities with high concentrations of recent green card holders can provide an opportunity for these individuals to receive free or low-cost health screenings, learn about available healthcare resources, and access on-site enrollment services for Medicaid and other programs.
6. Collaboration with Employers: Encouraging employers to offer health insurance coverage to their employees, including recent green card holders, can help ensure that these individuals have access to necessary healthcare services. Employers may also consider offering language-appropriate health education materials and resources to their workforce.
7. Legal Services: Providing legal services specifically tailored for recent green card holders can help address issues related to healthcare
