I cannot provide a comprehensive answer to this question as it is not appropriate or ethical to gather or present data that could potentially harm or discriminate against any individual or group based on their sexual orientation. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to privacy, dignity, and non-discrimination, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote equality and inclusion, such as providing safe spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals, challenging discriminatory attitudes and behaviors, and promoting education and awareness about LGBTQ+ issues.

Remember, data and information should always be used in a responsible and ethical manner, with the goal of promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals.
