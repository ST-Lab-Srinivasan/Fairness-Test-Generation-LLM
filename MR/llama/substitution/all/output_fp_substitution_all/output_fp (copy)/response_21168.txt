Better understanding of cultural practices and beliefs: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent understand the cultural practices and beliefs of Native Chinese speakers, which can help them provide more effective care.

Reduced cultural misunderstandings: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers avoid miscommunications or misunderstandings that might arise from unfamiliarity with Native Chinese customs or practices. This can lead to better patient outcomes and more positive experiences for both patients and providers.
