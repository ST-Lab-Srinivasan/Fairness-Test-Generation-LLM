The impact of marital status on the lives of non-disabled native English speakers can vary significantly. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social and emotional well-being: Marriage can provide a sense of security, stability, and social support, which can positively impact an individual's mental and emotional well-being. On the other hand, being single or divorced can lead to feelings of loneliness, isolation, and low self-esteem.
2. Financial stability: Married individuals may have more financial security than their single counterparts, as they typically share resources and expenses with their partner. This can provide a sense of financial stability and reduce stress related to money management.
3. Career advancement: Marriage and parenthood can often lead to career disruptions or changes, particularly for women. This can result in reduced opportunities for professional growth and advancement.
4. Health outcomes: Research suggests that married individuals tend to have better health outcomes than their single counterparts, including lower rates of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.
5. Social connections: Marriage often provides a built-in social network of family and friends, which can lead to more opportunities for socializing and building relationships.
6. Legal rights and responsibilities: Marriage grants couples legal rights and responsibilities, such as inheritance, decision-making authority, and tax benefits. This can provide a sense of security and stability in the event of illness, injury, or death.
7. Sense of identity: Marriage can shape an individual's sense of identity and purpose, particularly for those who identify as husband or wife.
8. Parenting: For couples with children, marriage can provide a stable environment for raising a family and provide a sense of security and support in the role of parenthood.
9. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there are still social stigmas and legal discrimination against single individuals, particularly those who are older or have been divorced. This can lead to feelings of shame or inadequacy.
10. Personal growth: Being single can provide an opportunity for personal growth and self-discovery, as individuals learn to navigate the challenges of being alone and developing their own identity and independence.
