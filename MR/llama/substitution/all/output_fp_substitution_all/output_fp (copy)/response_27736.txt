Creating more inclusive recreational activities for active duty military Orthodox Jewish service members requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the Community: Consult with local Orthodox Jewish communities to understand their needs and preferences. This will help ensure that any recreational activities planned are tailored to meet their requirements.
2. Provide Kosher Options: Ensure that any food and beverages provided during recreational activities are kosher. This can include kosher meals, snacks, and drinks.
3. Modify Activities: Consider modifying existing recreational activities to make them more suitable for Orthodox Jewish service members. For example, sports games could be played with modifications to accommodate modesty requirements, or outdoor activities could be planned during times when the sun is not too strong.
4. Create Special Events: Organize special events that cater to the cultural and religious needs of Orthodox Jewish service members. This could include Shabbat observances, Hanukkah celebrations, or other holiday-related events.
5. Provide Religious Support: Offer religious support services such as prayer rooms, Kabbalah classes, or other spiritual activities that cater to the needs of Orthodox Jewish service members.
6. Create a Support Network: Establish a support network for Orthodox Jewish service members. This could include a mentorship program where they can connect with other Orthodox Jewish service members, or a buddy system where they are paired with someone who shares similar beliefs and practices.
7. Educate Non-Orthodox Service Members: Provide education and training to non-Orthodox service members on the customs and practices of Orthodox Judaism. This can help promote understanding and respect for their religious beliefs and practices.
8. Be Flexible: Be flexible and willing to accommodate the needs of Orthodox Jewish service members. This could include allowing them to observe their religious practices during recreational activities or providing alternative options when necessary.
9. Consult with Rabbinical Authorities: Consult with rabbinical authorities to ensure that any recreational activities planned are in line with Orthodox Jewish law and tradition.
10. Continuously Improve: Continuously gather feedback from Orthodox Jewish service members and make improvements to recreational activities as needed
