To use data to highlight the issues faced by native Spanish speaker beginner French speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Collect data through surveys or interviews with a sample of native Spanish speakers who are learning French. This can help identify common challenges and difficulties faced by this group.
2. Analyze language proficiency levels: Use standardized language proficiency tests to measure the proficiency levels of native Spanish speakers in French. This can help identify areas where they may struggle more than other language learners.
3. Examine learning patterns and strategies: Study how native Spanish speakers approach learning French, including their use of language learning resources, study habits, and cognitive processes. This can help identify potential challenges and areas for improvement.
4. Investigate language transfer effects: Analyze how native Spanish speakers' knowledge of Spanish influences their ability to learn French. This can help identify any transfer effects that may affect their proficiency in French.
5. Compare learner data with native French speakers: Collect data on the linguistic and cognitive abilities of native Spanish speakers learning French, and compare it to similar data from native French speakers. This can help identify any differences or similarities between the two groups that may be relevant to language learning.
6. Use machine learning algorithms: Apply machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of linguistic and cognitive data from native Spanish speakers learning French. This can help identify patterns and trends in their language use and acquisition.
7. Create a corpus of learner language: Collect and analyze a large dataset of written or spoken language produced by native Spanish speakers learning French. This can help identify common linguistic errors, strengths, and weaknesses in their language production.
8. Investigate the role of motivation and self-efficacy: Study how factors such as motivation and self-efficacy (belief in one's ability to learn French) influence the language learning process for native Spanish speakers. This can help identify potential areas for intervention or support.
9. Examine the impact of instructional methods: Analyze the effectiveness of different instructional methods (e.g., explicit grammar teaching, communicative language teaching, etc.) in promoting language learning among native Spanish
