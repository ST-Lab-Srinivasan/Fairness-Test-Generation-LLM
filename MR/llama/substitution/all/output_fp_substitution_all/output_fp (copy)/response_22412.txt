Supporting the educational aspirations of non-independent active-duty people can be challenging due to various factors such as military training and deployment schedules, financial constraints, and limited access to educational resources. Here are some ways to support their educational aspirations:

1. Military spouse scholarships: Many organizations offer scholarships specifically for military spouses and dependents. These scholarships can help non-independent active-duty people pursue their educational goals without financial burden.
2. Online courses and degree programs: With the rise of online learning, it's now possible for non-independent active-duty people to take courses or pursue degree programs from anywhere in the world. This can help them balance their military obligations with their educational aspirations.
3. Tuition assistance programs: Many military branches offer tuition assistance programs to help service members pay for college or vocational training. These programs can be used to support non-independent active-duty people in pursuing their educational goals.
4. Military-friendly colleges and universities: Some institutions of higher education have military-friendly policies and programs that cater specifically to the needs of military service members, veterans, and their dependents. These schools may offer flexible scheduling options or online courses to help non-independent active-duty people balance their military obligations with their educational aspirations.
5. Career counseling and guidance: Military career counselors can provide guidance on career paths and educational opportunities that align with a service member's military specialty and personal interests. This can help non-independent active-duty people identify the best way to pursue their educational aspirations while still serving in the military.
6. Mentorship programs: Pairing non-independent active-duty people with experienced professionals or mentors in their field of interest can provide valuable guidance and support throughout their educational journey.
