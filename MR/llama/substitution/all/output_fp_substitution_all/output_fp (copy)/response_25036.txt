Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative, non-divorced individuals requires understanding and respecting the diversity of beliefs and practices within the community. Here are some ways to create more inclusive cultural celebrations:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Involve a diverse group of people in the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations. This can include individuals from different religious, cultural, and social backgrounds.
2. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups. For example, avoid using terms like "non-conservative" or "not divorced for a long time," as these can be seen as exclusionary.
3. Offer alternatives: Provide alternative activities or accommodations for individuals who may not participate in certain cultural practices due to religious or cultural beliefs. For example, offer vegetarian or halal food options for individuals who observe specific dietary restrictions.
4. Create safe spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can include designated areas for prayer or meditation, or activities that promote cultural exchange and understanding.
5. Educate and raise awareness: Educate yourself and others about the diverse beliefs and practices within the community. Raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity and respect for diversity in cultural celebrations.
6. Encourage participation: Encourage participation from all individuals, regardless of their religious or cultural background. Provide opportunities for individuals to share their traditions and practices with others.
7. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt and accommodate the needs of diverse individuals. For example, offer multiple dates or times for cultural celebrations to accommodate different schedules and beliefs.
8. Involve community leaders: Involve community leaders from diverse backgrounds in the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that the celebrations are inclusive and respectful of all individuals.
9. Provide accessibility options: Provide accessibility options for individuals with disabilities or mobility issues. This can include wheelchair-accessible spaces, Braille materials, or sign language interpretation.
