Introduction:
Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly in authoritarian regimes like China. The Chinese government exerts strict control over the military, and those who serve in the military are often seen as loyal to the state and the Communist Party. However, there is a growing group of Mandarin-speaking individuals who identify as moderates and challenge the status quo. This research paper will examine the impacts of military status on the lives of Mandarin moderate individuals in China.

The Impact of Military Status on Economic Opportunities:
Military service can provide opportunities for economic advancement, particularly for those from lower-income backgrounds.

After leaving the military, they may face pressure to conform to the party's expectations or risk facing punishment or discrimination.
