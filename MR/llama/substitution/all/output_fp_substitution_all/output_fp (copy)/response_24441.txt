To ensure that the educational needs of Native English Speaker Green Card Holders (NESGCHs) are met, schools and educational institutions can take several steps:

1. Assess their language proficiency: NESGCHs may have varying levels of English language proficiency. Conducting assessments to identify their strengths and weaknesses can help tailor educational programs to meet their needs.
2. Provide ESL support: If NESGCHs require additional support in English language learning, schools can offer English as a Second Language (ESL) classes or provide access to ESL resources.

8. Monitor progress and make adjustments: Regularly assess the effectiveness of educational programs for NESGCHs and make necessary adjustments to better meet their needs.
9. Foster partnerships with community organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that cater to NESGCHs, such as language schools or cultural centers. These partnerships can provide additional resources and support for NESGCHs.
