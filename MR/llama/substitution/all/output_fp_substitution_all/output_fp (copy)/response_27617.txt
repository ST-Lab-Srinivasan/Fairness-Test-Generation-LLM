Creating more inclusive housing policies for recently expecting ex-spouses requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge the need for flexible housing options: Recognize that pregnant women and new mothers may require temporary accommodations to ensure their safety and well-being during the critical postpartum period. Offer flexible lease terms, such as shorter leases or temporary relocation, to provide them with the necessary support.
2. Provide access to affordable childcare: Offer on-site or nearby childcare services, such as daycares or nannies, to help expectant and new mothers balance their family responsibilities with their housing obligations. This can be particularly helpful for those who may not have access to affordable childcare otherwise.
3. Create a support network: Establish a support network of resources and services specifically tailored to the needs of recently expecting ex-spouses. This could include postpartum care, mental health counseling, and financial planning workshops.
4. Offer baby-friendly amenities: Provide amenities that are conducive to families with young children, such as playgrounds, parks, or community spaces for playdates. Consider installing baby-friendly features in common areas, like diaper-changing stations or breastfeeding rooms.
5. Develop policies to address discrimination: Recognize that discrimination based on pregnancy or parental status still exists in many parts of the world. Develop policies and procedures to address these forms of discrimination and ensure that all residents are treated with dignity and respect.
6. Engage in community outreach and education: Educate landlords, property managers, and local service providers about the needs of recently expecting ex-spouses. Encourage them to be more supportive and understanding of these individuals' unique challenges.
7. Advocate for policy changes: Work with local government agencies and advocacy groups to push for policy changes that promote inclusivity and support for pregnant women and new mothers. Encourage policies that provide paid family leave, affordable childcare, and other forms of support.
8. Offer financial assistance: Provide financial assistance or incentives
