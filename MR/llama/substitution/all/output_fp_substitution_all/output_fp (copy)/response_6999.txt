Creating more inclusive social policies for non-in relationships, or "NIR" individuals, is essential to ensure that everyone has access to the same rights and opportunities. Here are some ways to achieve this goal:

1. Acknowledge and challenge discrimination: Recognize that discrimination against NIR individuals exists and address it through policies and practices that promote inclusivity. This can include providing education and training on issues related to sexuality, relationships, and gender identity.
