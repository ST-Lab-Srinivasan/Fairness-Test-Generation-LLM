6. Provide mentorship and role models: Pair LGBTQ+ students with mentors who can provide guidance, support, and encouragement. Identify LGBTQ+ role models within the school community or outside organizations who can inspire and motivate students.
7. Address bullying and discrimination: Develop policies and procedures to address bullying and discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Provide training for staff and faculty on how to identify and address these issues.
8. Celebrate LGBTQ+ diversity: Host events and activities that celebrate
