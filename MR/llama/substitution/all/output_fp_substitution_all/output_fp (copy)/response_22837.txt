Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically Hispanic requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and awareness for staff and volunteers involved in the program. This can help them understand the unique needs and experiences of the target audience and avoid unintentionally offensive or insensitive interactions.
2. Bilingual programming: Offer cultural programs that are conducted in both Chinese and Spanish to cater to the diverse language proficiency levels of the participants. This can also help participants who may feel more comfortable learning in their native language.
3. Inclusive marketing: Develop marketing strategies that actively reach out to ethnically Hispanic communities. Utilize social media platforms and community events to promote the program and encourage participation.
4. Cultural representation: Ensure that the program's content and activities reflect the cultural practices and traditions of both Chinese and Hispanic cultures. This can be achieved by incorporating elements such as music, dance, art, and food from both cultures.
5. Accessibility: Make sure that the program is accessible to participants with varying levels of language proficiency in both Chinese and Spanish. Offer translation support or interpreters for those who need it, and provide opportunities for participants to practice speaking and listening to both languages.
6. Community engagement: Encourage community members from both cultures to participate in the program as volunteers, mentors, or instructors. This can help build bridges between the two communities and create a sense of ownership and investment in the program's success.
7. Flexibility: Be flexible with scheduling and programming to accommodate the diverse needs and preferences of participants. Offer classes at various times and locations to cater to different schedules and make sure that the program is inclusive and welcoming to all.
8. Collaboration: Collaborate with other organizations that serve ethnically Hispanic communities to cross-promote each other's programs and reach a broader audience. This can help create a network of support and resources for participants.
9. Evaluation and feedback: Regularly evaluate the program's effectiveness in reaching and serving ethnically Hispanic communities.
