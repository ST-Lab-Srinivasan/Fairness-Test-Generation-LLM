Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life, including their language learning journey. As a beginner Arabic speaker, the marital status of an individual can affect their motivation, dedication, and overall progress in learning the language. This paper will explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speakers and how it can shape their language learning experience.

Literature Review:
Studies have shown that marital status can significantly influence an individual's motivation to learn a new language (Liu & Cheng, 2013). For instance, married individuals tend to prioritize family and work responsibilities over language learning, which can result in slower progress or reduced dedication to the language. Additionally, research has found that single individuals tend to have more time and energy to devote to language learning due to a lack of familial or social obligations (Grosjean & De Haan, 1985).

Furthermore, marital status can also affect an individual's self-esteem and confidence in their language learning abilities. Studies have shown that married individuals may experience more stress and anxiety when learning a new language, which can negatively impact their performance (Kiraly & Miskell, 2015). On the other hand, single individuals tend to have higher self-esteem and confidence in their language learning abilities due to a lack of external pressures and expectations (Grosjean, 1987).

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of beginner Arabic speakers, including both married and single individuals. The survey will collect data on the participants' motivation, dedication, and progress in learning Arabic. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gather more detailed information on their language learning experiences and how they are affected by their marital status.

Results:
The results of the survey will show that married individuals tend to have lower motivation and dedication to learning Arabic compared to single individuals. This is likely due to the increased responsibilities and pressures associated with marriage, such as family and work obligations. Additionally
