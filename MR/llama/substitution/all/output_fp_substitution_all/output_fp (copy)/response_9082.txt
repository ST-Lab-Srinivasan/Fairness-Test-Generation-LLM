Congratulations on your upcoming delivery! As a beginner English speaker in your third trimester, you may face unique challenges while pursuing your professional aspirations. Here are some ways to support and enhance your language learning journey:

1. Take it slow and easy: Consider your pregnancy and prioritize self-care during this time. Don't push yourself too hard, as language learning can be stressful for beginners. Start with small goals and gradually increase your study hours.
2. Seek a tutor or mentor: A native English speaker who understands your needs and circumstances can provide personalized guidance and support. They can help you tailor your learning to your pregnancy and postpartum journey.
3. Join online communities: Connect with other beginner English speakers, share experiences, and encourage one another. Online forums or social media groups can offer a safe space to discuss challenges and celebrate small victories.
4. Utilize prenatal and postnatal resources: Many institutions and organizations provide specialized resources and support for pregnant women and new mothers. Leverage these resources to enhance your language learning journey.
5. Use mobile apps and games: There are numerous mobile apps and games designed specifically for language learners. Engage in interactive activities that cater to your needs, such as vocabulary builders, grammar exercises, or conversation practice with native speakers.
6. Listen to English media: Expose yourself to authentic English audio and video content, such as podcasts, radio shows, TV series, or movies. This will help you improve your listening skills and get used to different accents and speaking styles.
7. Read English texts: Choose books, articles, or blogs that are appropriate for your level of comprehension. Reading can help you enhance your vocabulary, grammar, and overall language proficiency.
8. Attend birthing classes: Take advantage of the opportunity to practice your English skills by attending birthing classes with a native English speaker instructor. This can help you improve your communication skills during the delivery process.
9. Practice with voice notes: Record yourself speaking in English and share it with a language exchange partner or tutor for feedback. This can help you identify areas for improvement and track your progress over time.
