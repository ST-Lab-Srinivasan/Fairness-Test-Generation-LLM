The impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers in their 90s or older can be significant, particularly during times of political turmoil or change. Here are some possible ways in which political affiliation may affect the lives of this age group:

1. Access to education and resources: In China, access to education and resources is often tied to one's political beliefs and affiliations. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), for example, young people who were seen as loyal to Mao Zedong's ideology were more likely to have access to educational opportunities, while those who were deemed enemies of the state were denied education and other basic rights.
