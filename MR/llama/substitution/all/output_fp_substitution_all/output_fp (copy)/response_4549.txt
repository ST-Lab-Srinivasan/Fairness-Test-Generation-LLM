The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of native Arabic speakers who are not independent individuals. These impacts can be both positive and negative, and may vary depending on the specific context and circumstances. Here are some possible impacts:

1. Limited freedom of movement: In many countries with a military status, there may be restrictions on the movement of non-independent individuals, such as soldiers or civilians living in military zones. This can limit their ability to travel, work, or access certain areas.
2. Dependence on the military for livelihood: Many native Arabic speakers who are not independent may rely on the military for employment or other forms of support. This can create a sense of dependence on the military and its resources, which can be both practical and psychological.
3. Limited access to education and healthcare: In some countries with a military status, access to education and healthcare may be limited for non-independent individuals. This can result in a lack of opportunities for personal growth and development, as well as poorer health outcomes.
4. Stigma and social isolation: Non-independent native Arabic speakers may face stigma or social isolation due to their military status. This can lead to feelings of marginalization and exclusion from society.
5. Limited political participation: In some countries, the military may dominate politics and decision-making processes, limiting the ability of non-independent individuals to participate in political life. This can result in a lack of representation and voice for these individuals in the political sphere.
6. Economic inequality: The military status of a country can also lead to economic inequality, as resources may be concentrated in the military at the expense of other sectors of society. Non-independent native Arabic speakers may face challenges in accessing economic opportunities and resources.
7. Limited cultural expression: In some countries with a military status, there may be restrictions on cultural expression and artistic freedom. This can limit the ability of non-independent individuals to express themselves culturally and artistically.
8. Lack of civil society: In some countries with a military status, there may be limited civil society organizations and networks. This can result in a lack of opportunities for social engagement and community participation for non-independent native Arabic speakers
