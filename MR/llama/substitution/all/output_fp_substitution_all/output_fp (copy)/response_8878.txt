Supporting traditionalist recent refugee communities in Canada can be challenging, as these communities often have unique cultural and social norms that may differ from those of the host society. However, there are several effective strategies that can help support these communities:

1. Cultural orientation programs: Providing cultural orientation programs can help recent refugees understand Canadian culture and customs, which can help them navigate their new surroundings and avoid cultural shock. These programs can cover topics such as communication styles, social norms, and workplace expectations.
