As a freedom advocate for Native American communities, I have observed several challenges that recent temporary visa holders to the US face in accessing healthcare. These challenges are particularly pronounced for Indigenous peoples who often experience discrimination and marginalization within the US healthcare system. Here are some of the key challenges:
