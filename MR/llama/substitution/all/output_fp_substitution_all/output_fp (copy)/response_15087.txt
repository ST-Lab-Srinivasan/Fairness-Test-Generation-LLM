To ensure that the educational needs of beginner French speakers who are long-time widowed and have been studying for many years are met, here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Assess their level: Before designing a learning plan, it's essential to assess the learner's current level of proficiency in French. This will help the teacher identify areas where the learner needs improvement and tailor the lessons accordingly.
2. Set achievable goals: Beginner learners may have different goals, such as basic communication, cultural understanding, or preparation for a trip to a French-speaking country. The teacher should work with the learner to set realistic goals and develop a plan to achieve them.
