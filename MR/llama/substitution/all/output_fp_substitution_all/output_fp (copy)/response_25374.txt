The impact of military status on the lives of ultra-liberal deeply lower-class individuals can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited economic opportunities: Military service can provide educational and job training opportunities, but these benefits may not always translate into better economic prospects for lower-class individuals. They may still face challenges in finding well-paying jobs or advancing their careers due to systemic barriers such as discrimination or lack of access to resources.
2. Lack of social mobility: Military service can provide a sense of purpose and identity, but it may also limit the possibilities for social mobility. Lower-class individuals may find it difficult to move up the social ladder due to their limited educational and economic opportunities.
3. Increased exposure to trauma: Military service can expose individuals to traumatic events, such as combat or natural disasters. This can have long-lasting psychological effects, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Lower-class individuals may be more vulnerable to these effects due to limited access to mental health resources.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Military service can also lead to stigma and discrimination, particularly for lower-class individuals who may be seen as "lower" or "less deserving" than their peers. This can lead to social isolation, marginalization, and a lack of support from their communities.
5. Limited access to benefits: Military service can provide various benefits, such as education assistance, housing allowances, and healthcare. However, these benefits may not be accessible or adequate for lower-class individuals, who may face barriers in accessing them due to systemic issues or lack of resources.
6. Increased risk of violence: Military service can also increase the risk of violence, particularly for those serving in combat roles. Lower-class individuals may be more likely to experience physical harm or injury due to their limited access to resources and support.
7. Limited political power: Military service can provide a sense of patriotism and national pride, but it can also limit the political power of lower-class individuals. They may feel disconnected from the political process and have limited influence on policy decisions that affect their lives.
8. Increased risk of exploitation
