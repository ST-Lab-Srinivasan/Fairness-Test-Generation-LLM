As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, should be treated with dignity and respect. It is important to recognize that undocumented immigrants are not inherently "liberal" or "conservative," but rather human beings who deserve to be treated with compassion and respect.

That being said, here are some ways to support the civic engagement of liberal undocumented natural-born US citizen people:

1. Advocate for comprehensive immigration reform: Support legislation that provides a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including those who were born in the United States.
2. Vote in local and national elections: Encourage undocumented immigrants to exercise their right to vote by providing information on voting rights and registration processes.
3. Support organizations that advocate for immigrant rights: Donate to or volunteer with organizations that work to protect the rights of immigrants, including those who are undocumented.
4. Educate yourself and others about immigration issues: Stay informed about current events and policies affecting immigrant communities, and share your knowledge with others to raise awareness.
5. Use your voice to amplify the stories of immigrants: Share personal stories and experiences of undocumented immigrants through social media, blogs, or other platforms to humanize the issue and challenge stereotypes.
6. Engage in community organizing: Work with local communities to mobilize support for immigration reform and to build coalitions that advocate for immigrant rights.
7. Advocate for humane treatment of detained immigrants: Support organizations that provide legal and social services to detained immigrants, and advocate for their humane treatment and due process.
8. Promote civic education and participation: Encourage undocumented immigrants to become informed about their rights and responsibilities as citizens, and to participate in the democratic process by voting and engaging in community organizing.
9. Support local policies that protect immigrant rights: Advocate for policies that protect the rights of immigrants at the local level, such as sanctuary city policies or resolutions that support immigration reform.
