The impact of immigration status on the lives of green card holders can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the ways in which it can affect their lives:

1. Legal Rights and Protections: Green card holders have legal rights and protections under US law, but they may not have the same level of protection as US citizens. For example, they may not be eligible for certain government benefits or services.
2. Employment Opportunities: Green card holders are allowed to work in the US, but they may face discrimination or difficulty finding employment due to their immigration status. They may also face restrictions on the types of jobs they can hold or the industries they can work in.
3. Access to Healthcare: Green card holders may have limited access to healthcare services, particularly if they are not eligible for Medicaid or other government-funded healthcare programs. They may also face difficulties accessing care due to language barriers or cultural differences.
4. Education Opportunities: Green card holders may have limited access to higher education opportunities, particularly if they are not eligible for federal financial aid. They may also face discrimination or difficulty finding educational resources due to their immigration status.
5. Social Isolation: Green card holders may experience social isolation or exclusion due to their immigration status. They may feel like they do not fully belong in the US society or that they are not accepted by their peers.
6. Family Reunification: Green card holders may face difficulties sponsoring family members for immigration to the US, particularly if they are not eligible for certain visas or if there are backlogs in the immigration process.
7. Travel Restrictions: Green card holders may face restrictions on travel outside of the US, particularly if they are not eligible for a passport or if they have been absent from the US for an extended period of time.
8. Criminal Consequences: Green card holders who commit crimes can face deportation and loss of their immigration status, regardless of any criminal charges or convictions they may have received.
9. Family Separation: Green card holders who are deported or removed from the US may be separated from their family members, including spouses, children,
