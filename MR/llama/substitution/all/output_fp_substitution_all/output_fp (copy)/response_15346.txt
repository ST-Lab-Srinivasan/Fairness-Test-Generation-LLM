As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that it is crucial to recognize that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodiverse condition that affects individuals of all backgrounds, cultures, and identities. Therefore, any legislative changes aimed at benefiting native English speaker autistic communities should also prioritize the needs and experiences of non-native English speaker autistic communities and other marginalized groups.

That being said, here are some potential legislative changes that could benefit autistic individuals across various backgrounds:

1. Increased funding for autism research and services: Autism is a complex condition with many unmet needs. Increasing funding for research and services can help improve diagnosis accuracy, provide more effective treatments, and enhance the quality of life for autistic individuals.
2. Anti-discrimination laws and policies: People with ASD often face discrimination and stigma, which can lead to social isolation and decreased opportunities. Enacting anti-discrimination laws and policies can help protect the rights of autistic individuals and promote inclusivity in education, employment, and other areas.
3. Accessibility improvements: Many autistic individuals face challenges in accessing public spaces and services due to a lack of accessibility features. Improving accessibility in buildings, transportation, and digital platforms can help ensure equal opportunities for all.
4. Support for caregivers: Caregiving for an autistic individual can be emotionally and financially challenging. Providing support for caregivers through respite services, financial assistance, and mental health resources can help alleviate some of these burdens.
5. Autism-specific training for professionals: Ensuring that professionals have access to autism-specific training can improve their ability to diagnose and support autistic individuals. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses, better treatment outcomes, and increased opportunities for employment and education.
6. Inclusive education policies: Autistic students often face challenges in traditional educational settings due to lack of accommodations and understanding from teachers and peers. Implementing inclusive education policies that cater to the unique needs of autistic students can help ensure their success and well-being.
7. Employment support
