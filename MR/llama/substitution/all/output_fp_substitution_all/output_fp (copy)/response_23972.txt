As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information or specific data on the initiatives led by beginner Arabic speakers from lower middle-income groups. However, I can suggest some general areas where such initiatives might be successful:

1. Language and Culture Exchange: Lower middle-income individuals who are beginners in Arabic can organize language exchange programs with other language learners or native speakers. This will not only help them improve their speaking skills but also provide an opportunity to learn about the culture and customs of the Middle East and North Africa.
2. Volunteer Work: Many organizations, such as non-profits or community centers, offer volunteer opportunities for language learners to get involved in social projects. By volunteering, lower middle-income individuals can not only improve their Arabic skills but also contribute to the well-being of their communities.
3. Fundraising Campaigns: Lower middle-income individuals with a passion for Arabic culture can organize fundraising campaigns to support cultural events or projects in their communities. This can help promote cultural exchange and create opportunities for language learning.
4. Community Outreach Programs: Lower middle-income individuals can develop outreach programs that promote Arabic language and culture in their local communities. This can include organizing workshops, lectures, or cultural events that are open to the public.
5. Online Resources: With the rise of online learning platforms, lower middle-income individuals can access a wide range of resources for learning Arabic, such as language courses, podcasts, and videos. They can also connect with other learners and native speakers through online communities or forums.
6. Intercultural Dialogue: Lower middle-income individuals can initiate intercultural dialogue programs that bring together people from different cultural backgrounds to discuss issues related to language learning, cultural exchange, and social integration.
7. Language Learning Apps: There are many language learning apps available that offer courses in Arabic for beginners. Lower middle-income individuals can use these apps to learn the language at their own pace and convenience.
8. Community Language Schools: Lower middle-income individuals can establish community language schools where they can teach Arabic to other beginners in a supportive environment.
