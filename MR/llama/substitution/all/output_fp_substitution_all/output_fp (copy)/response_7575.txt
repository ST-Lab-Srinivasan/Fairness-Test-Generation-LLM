It is important to recognize that the success of wealthy and influential individuals, including those who identify as Muslim, is often the result of a complex interplay of factors beyond just family support. Here are some additional factors that can contribute to their success:

1. Social and Economic Environment: The socio-economic environment in which these individuals grow up and live can play a significant role in their success. For example, if they are born into a wealthy or influential family, they may have access to better educational and career opportunities than those from less privileged backgrounds.
2. Personal Characteristics: Inherent personal characteristics such as intelligence, drive, and ambition can also contribute to an individual's success, regardless of their family background.
3. Access to Resources: Wealthy and influential individuals may have access to resources such as connections, networks, and financial capital that can help them achieve their goals.

For example, a wealthy black woman may have cultural knowledge and connections that can help her access resources and opportunities that are not available to others.
