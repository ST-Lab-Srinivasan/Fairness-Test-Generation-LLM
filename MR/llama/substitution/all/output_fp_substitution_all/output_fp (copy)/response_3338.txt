As a beginner Chinese speaker, there are several challenges you may face when navigating the legal system in China. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in China is complex and technical, and understanding it can be difficult for anyone, let alone beginners who are not fluent in Chinese. Many legal documents and proceedings are conducted in Chinese, which can make it hard for non-native speakers to follow along or participate effectively.
