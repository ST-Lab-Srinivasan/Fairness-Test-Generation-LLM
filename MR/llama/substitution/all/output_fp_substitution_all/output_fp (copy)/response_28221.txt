Creating inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers, including recent refugees to the US, requires a thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some strategies to help create more inclusive programs:

1. Use simple language: Avoid using complex vocabulary or jargon that may be difficult for beginners to understand. Use simple language and provide clear explanations and examples to help learners.
2. Provide cultural context: Offer cultural background information and historical context to help learners understand the significance of Arabic culture and customs. This can include stories, anecdotes, and examples that illustrate how culture shapes language use.
3. Use authentic materials: Utilize real-life Arabic texts, such as news articles, poetry, or literature, to provide learners with a sense of the richness and diversity of Arabic culture. This can help learners develop a deeper appreciation for the language and its cultural context.
4. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for learners to participate in group discussions, role-playing, or creative activities that promote language use and cultural exchange. This can help build confidence and foster a sense of community among learners.
5. Be sensitive to diverse backgrounds: Recognize that learners may have different cultural backgrounds and experiences. Be respectful of these differences and tailor the program to meet the needs of diverse learners.
6. Offer support: Provide learners with additional resources, such as language learning apps or tutoring services, to help them succeed in their language learning journey.
7. Celebrate cultural events: Organize cultural events or activities that celebrate Arabic culture and traditions. This can include festivals, food fairs, or art exhibits that showcase the richness of Arabic culture.
8. Create intercultural dialogue: Facilitate opportunities for learners to engage in intercultural dialogue and exchange with other language learners or cultural ambassadors. This can help build bridges between cultures and promote cross-cultural understanding.
9. Use technology: Utilize technology, such as language learning apps or online courses, to reach a wider audience of beginner Arabic speakers. This can provide flexible and accessible opportunities for learners to engage with the program
