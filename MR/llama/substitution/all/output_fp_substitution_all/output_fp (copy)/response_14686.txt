Title: Cultural Heritage and Long-Term Green Card Holders: An Exploratory Study

Abstract:
This study investigates the role of cultural heritage in the lives of long-term green card holders who are native English speakers. Through a qualitative research design, we interviewed 20 participants who have held their green cards for over 10 years and explored how their cultural heritage influences their identities, relationships, and experiences as immigrants in the United States. Our findings reveal that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping these individuals' sense of belonging, values, and worldviews. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the complexities of immigration and identity formation among long-term green card holders.

Introduction:
Immigration is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involves the movement of people from one country to another. In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the experiences and identities of immigrants who have lived in the United States for an extended period of time. This study aims to contribute to this body of knowledge by exploring the role of cultural heritage in the lives of long-term green card holders who are native English speakers.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping immigrants' identities and experiences (Hall, 1992; Gudykunst & Ting-Toomey, 1988). However, there is limited research on the experiences of long-term green card holders who are native English speakers. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring how these individuals' cultural heritage influences their identities and relationships in their host country.

Methodology:
We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 long-term green card holders who have lived in the United States for over 10 years. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling, and included individuals from a variety of countries and cultural backgrounds. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. We analyzed the data using thematic analysis to identify patterns and themes related to the role of cultural heritage in participants' lives.

Results:
Our findings reveal that cultural heritage plays
