Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American recent temporary visa holders to the US from a Marxist perspective. As Marxist theory argues, cultural heritage is a means by which individuals and groups construct their identities and experiences within the broader social and economic structures of society.

For Native American recent temporary visa holders, cultural heritage can serve as a source of resistance against the dominant culture and power structures in the US. As members of marginalized communities, they may feel pressure to assimilate into mainstream American culture, which can lead to the erasure of their indigenous identities and histories. However, by drawing on their cultural heritage and traditional practices, they can assert their agency and challenge the dominant narratives that have been imposed upon them.

For example, many Native American communities have experienced historical trauma resulting from colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression. By engaging in cultural practices such as ceremonies, storytelling, and art, these individuals can work through these traumas and reclaim their cultural identities. This process of cultural revitalization can also serve as a means of resisting the dominant culture and promoting social justice.

Furthermore, the experience of being a recent temporary visa holder to the US can also inform an individual's understanding of cultural heritage. As they navigate the complexities of US immigration policies and systems, they may encounter forms of oppression and discrimination that are embedded in the very structures of the state. By drawing on their cultural heritage as a means of resistance, they can challenge these structures and advocate for social change.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a crucial role in shaping the identities of Native American recent temporary visa holders to the US from a Marxist perspective. It serves as a source of resistance, a means of challenging dominant narratives and power structures, and a way of reclaiming agency and promoting social justice. By engaging with their cultural heritage, these individuals can assert their identities and experiences within the broader social and economic structures of society, and work towards a more equitable and just world.
