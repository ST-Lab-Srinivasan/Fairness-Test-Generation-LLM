I'm glad you're interested in learning about community initiatives led by beginner Chinese speakers from lower-class backgrounds! Here are some examples of such initiatives:

1. Language exchange programs: Many communities have established language exchange programs that connect beginners with more advanced Chinese speakers. These programs provide an opportunity for beginners to practice speaking and listening to Chinese in a supportive environment.
