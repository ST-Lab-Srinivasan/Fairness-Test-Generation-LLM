Volunteerism plays a crucial role in supporting financially disadvantaged communities, particularly those with a strong liberal tradition. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can help:

1. Providing direct support: Volunteers can provide direct support to individuals and organizations within these communities by helping with tasks such as food distribution, clothing drives, and other forms of aid.
