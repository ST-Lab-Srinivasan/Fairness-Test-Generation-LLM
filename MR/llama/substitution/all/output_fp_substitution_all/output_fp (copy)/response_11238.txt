Addressing the needs of cognitively impaired individuals, including those with mixed Asian heritage, is crucial in disaster response. Here are some strategies that can be employed to ensure their safety and well-being:

1. Cultural Competence: Disaster responders must be culturally competent when working with cognitively impaired individuals from diverse backgrounds. This means understanding the unique cultural and linguistic needs of each community and tailoring responses accordingly.
