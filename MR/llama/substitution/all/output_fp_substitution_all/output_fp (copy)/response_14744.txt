Creating more inclusive community events for native Chinese speaker lower-class people requires understanding their needs and preferences, as well as addressing the systemic barriers that prevent them from participating fully. Here are some strategies to help create more inclusive events:

1. Listen to their voices: Consult with lower-class Native Chinese speakers to understand their perspectives and concerns. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews. Ensure that the views of this group are represented in the planning process.
2. Provide accessible language support: Offer interpreters or bilingual staff at events to assist lower-class Native Chinese speakers who may not be fluent in Mandarin or other dominant languages. This can help ensure that everyone can fully participate and engage with the content.
3. Address cultural barriers: Be sensitive to cultural differences and customs when planning events. For example, some lower-class Native Chinese speakers may come from collectivist cultures where the needs of the group are prioritized over individual preferences. Be mindful of these cultural nuances when designing activities and interactions.
4. Offer childcare and transportation support: Lower-class Native Chinese speakers may face challenges in accessing events due to lack of childcare or transportation options. Providing these services can help remove these barriers and ensure greater participation.
5. Create inclusive marketing materials: Develop marketing materials that cater to the needs and preferences of lower-class Native Chinese speakers. Use images, language, and messaging that resonate with this group.
6. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming environment by highlighting the importance of community and inclusivity. Encourage participants to share their experiences and perspectives, fostering a sense of belonging among all attendees.
7. Provide affordable food options: Lower-class Native Chinese speakers may face financial constraints that prevent them from accessing expensive food options. Offer affordable and culturally relevant food choices at events to ensure everyone can participate fully.
8. Address power dynamics: Be aware of the systemic inequalities that exist within communities and address them proactively. Ensure that lower-class Native Chinese speakers have equal opportunities to participate and contribute to event planning.
