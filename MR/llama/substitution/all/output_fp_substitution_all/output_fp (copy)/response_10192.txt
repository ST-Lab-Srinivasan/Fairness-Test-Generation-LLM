Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of natural-born citizens who are lifelong widows. Here are some of the ways in which disability may affect their lives:

1. Social isolation: Women with disabilities may face social isolation, as they may have difficulty participating in social activities or visiting public places due to mobility issues. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression.
2. Economic challenges: Disability can make it difficult for women to work or earn a living, leading to financial difficulties and dependence on family members or government support.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Women with disabilities may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including lack of transportation, difficulty navigating medical facilities, and discrimination by healthcare providers.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Women with disabilities may experience stigma and discrimination from society, which can lead to lower self-esteem and self-worth.
5. Limited education and employment opportunities: Disability can limit a woman's access to education and employment opportunities, as she may face barriers in accessing educational resources or being hired due to her disability.
6. Difficulty with daily living activities: Women with disabilities may have difficulty with daily living activities such as bathing, dressing, and grooming, which can affect their self-esteem and independence.
7. Limited social support: Women with disabilities may face limited social support from family members or friends, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness.
8. Difficulty in forming relationships: Disability can make it difficult for women to form romantic relationships or friendships due to societal stigma and discrimination.
9. Mental health challenges: Women with disabilities may face higher rates of mental health challenges such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the challenges they face in their daily lives.
10. Lack of representation and voice: Women with disabilities may lack representation and a voice in society, which can result in a lack of understanding and support for their needs and rights.

It is important to recognize that these impacts are not universal and may vary depending on the individual's experiences
