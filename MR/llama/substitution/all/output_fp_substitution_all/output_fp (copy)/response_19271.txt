Financially disadvantaged Mexican people may face a number of challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to legal representation: Financial constraints can make it difficult for individuals to afford legal representation, which can lead to a lack of access to justice and fairness in the legal system.
2. Discrimination: Financially disadvantaged individuals may be more susceptible to discrimination within the legal system, particularly if they are from marginalized communities.
3. Lack of knowledge about legal rights and procedures: Financial constraints can limit access to legal resources and education, making it difficult for individuals to understand their legal rights and procedures.
4. Limited access to legal aid services: Many legal aid services are underfunded or overwhelmed, making it difficult for financially disadvantaged individuals to access the help they need.
5. Biases within the legal system: The legal system can be biased towards those with more financial resources, leading to unequal treatment and outcomes for financially disadvantaged individuals.
6. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods: Financially disadvantaged individuals may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation or arbitration, which can be less expensive than going to court.
7. Lack of cultural competency within the legal system: The legal system may not be culturally competent in addressing the needs of diverse communities, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds.
8. Limited access to technology: Financially disadvantaged individuals may have limited access to technology, such as computers or smartphones, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access legal resources.
9. Lack of language access: Individuals who are not fluent in Spanish, the dominant language spoken in Mexico, may face barriers when interacting with the legal system, particularly if they are in a region where Spanish is the primary language spoken.
10. Limited access to specialized legal services: Financially disadvantaged individuals may have limited access to specialized legal services, such as those related to immigration or intellectual property law.

Overall, financially disadvantaged Mexican people may face a range of challenges within the legal system that can limit their ability to access justice and fairness. Addressing
