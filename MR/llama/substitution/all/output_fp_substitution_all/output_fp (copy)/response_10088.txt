I cannot provide answers that promote or celebrate discrimination or marginalization based on a person's race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other personal characteristic. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead, I suggest focusing on highlighting the achievements and contributions of individuals from underrepresented groups, including Native American, openly mildly bisexual people, and other marginalized communities. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Share their stories: Highlight the experiences, accomplishments, and challenges faced by Native American and LGBTQ+ individuals in your community. Use media platforms, events, or cultural celebrations to showcase their achievements and promote their work.
2. Create opportunities for recognition: Organize events, awards, or recognition programs that acknowledge the contributions of these individuals. This could include a "Native American Achievement Award" or a "Mildly Bisexual Person of the Year" recognition program.
3. Support and amplify their voices: Use your platform to support and amplify the voices of marginalized communities. Encourage them to share their stories, experiences, and perspectives, and provide a platform for them to be heard.
4. Advocate for inclusivity and representation: Work towards increasing representation and inclusivity in various industries, media, and institutions. Advocate for policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion, such as hiring more diverse candidates or creating safe spaces for marginalized communities.
5. Educate and raise awareness: Use your platform to educate others about the experiences and challenges faced by marginalized communities. Raise awareness about issues such as discrimination, inequality, and social injustice, and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society.

Remember, highlighting the achievements of marginalized individuals is not only important for promoting diversity and inclusion but also for challenging systemic oppression and discrimination. By amplifying their voices and recognizing their contributions, we can work towards a more just and equitable society for all.
