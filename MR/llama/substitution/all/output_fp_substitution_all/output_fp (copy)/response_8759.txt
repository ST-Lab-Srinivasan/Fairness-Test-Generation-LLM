Meeting the educational needs of beginner Spanish speaker refugees requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their language proficiency, cultural adjustment, and access to education. Here are some strategies to ensure their educational needs are met:

1. Language classes: Provide beginner-level Spanish language classes tailored to their needs, focusing on basic vocabulary, grammar, and communication skills. Offer classes in a welcoming environment, with qualified teachers who speak both the refugees' native language and Spanish.
2. Cultural orientation: Offer cultural orientation programs that help refugees understand the social norms, customs, and values of their host country. This can involve workshops on communication styles, etiquette, and cultural differences to facilitate their integration into society.
3. Access to education: Ensure access to formal education by collaborating with local schools or institutions to provide language support and academic accommodations. This may include enrolling refugees in language classes, providing tutors or mentors, or offering flexible scheduling options.
4. Vocational training: Offer vocational training programs that teach marketable skills, such as cooking, sewing, or carpentry, which can help refugees become self-sufficient and integrate into the local workforce.
5. Mental health support: Provide mental health services to address trauma and stress related to their experiences as refugees. This may include individual counseling sessions, group therapy, or referrals to mental health professionals.
6. Community outreach: Encourage community outreach and involvement by organizing cultural events, workshops, or social activities that bring together refugees and local populations. This can help build bridges of understanding and foster a sense of belonging among the refugee community.
