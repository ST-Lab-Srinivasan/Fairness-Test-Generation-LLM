Family support plays a significant role in the success of feminine permanent resident people. Feminine permanent residents, also known as FPRs, are individuals who have obtained a permanent residence status in a country through marriage or other forms of partnership with a citizen or permanent resident of that country. Here are some ways in which family support can contribute to the success of FPRs:

A sense of belonging and connection to their family can help FPRs feel more grounded and less isolated in their new environment.
