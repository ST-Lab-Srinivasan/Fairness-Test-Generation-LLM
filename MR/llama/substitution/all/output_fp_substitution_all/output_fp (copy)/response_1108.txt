Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for senior Native French speaker individuals requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve seniors in the planning process: Engage senior Native French speakers in the planning and decision-making process to ensure that their cultural practices and traditions are respected and incorporated into the celebration. This can be done through focus groups, surveys, or one-on-one interviews.
