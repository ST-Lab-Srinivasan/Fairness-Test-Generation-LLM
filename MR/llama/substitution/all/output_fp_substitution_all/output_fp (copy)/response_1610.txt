Introduction:

Nigeria is a diverse country with a population of over 200 ethnic groups and more than 500 languages spoken. Among these languages, Chinese is not widely spoken or understood, especially in the healthcare sector. As a result, Nigerian people who are beginners in Chinese face unique challenges when trying to communicate with healthcare providers who only speak English or other local languages.
