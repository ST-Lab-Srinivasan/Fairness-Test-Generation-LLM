As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that collecting and using data on any individual or group without their consent is illegal and unethical. It is important to respect the privacy and dignity of all individuals, including those who identify as Mexican lesbians.

Instead of focusing on collecting data without consent, there are other ways to highlight the issues faced by Mexican lesbian individuals:

1. Conduct surveys or studies with their consent: You can conduct surveys or studies with the consent of Mexican lesbian individuals to gather information about their experiences and challenges. This approach is ethical and respectful, and can provide valuable insights into their lives.
2. Amplify their voices: You can amplify the voices of Mexican lesbian individuals by sharing their stories, experiences, and perspectives through various media channels. This can help raise awareness about the issues they face and promote understanding and acceptance.
3. Support organizations that serve them: There are many organizations that serve the LGBTQ+ community in Mexico, including those that specifically focus on lesbian issues. You can support these organizations by donating money, volunteering your time, or spreading the word about their work.
4. Advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and respect: You can advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can include advocating for anti-discrimination laws, access to healthcare, and other essential services.

Remember, it is important to approach these issues with sensitivity and respect, and to prioritize the privacy and dignity of Mexican lesbian individuals. By working together, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
