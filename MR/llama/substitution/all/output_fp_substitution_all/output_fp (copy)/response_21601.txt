Supporting the social inclusion of post-transition early-transition asexual nominal Muslim people can be achieved through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity of asexual individuals within Muslim communities. This can help reduce stigma and discrimination towards asexuality.
2. Create safe spaces: Establish online or offline communities, support groups, or forums where asexual Muslims can connect with each other, share their experiences, and feel comfortable being themselves without fear of judgment or rejection.
3. Advocate for inclusive policies: Encourage Muslim organizations and institutions to adopt policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, such as providing gender-neutral options for identity and pronouns.
4. Media representation: Promote diverse representations of asexual individuals in media, including literature, art, and film. This can help challenge stereotypes and increase visibility and understanding of asexuality within Muslim communities.
5. Interfaith dialogue: Facilitate interfaith dialogue and collaborations between Muslim and non-Muslim organizations to promote mutual respect, understanding, and inclusion. This can help break down barriers and build bridges between different communities.
6. Community outreach: Organize community events, workshops, or conferences that bring together Muslims and allies to discuss issues related to asexuality, sexuality, and social justice. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for asexual individuals within Muslim communities.
7. Advocacy and activism: Engage in advocacy and activism efforts to challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices towards asexual individuals within Muslim communities. This can involve campaigning for policy changes, speaking out against discrimination, and supporting marginalized communities.
8. Healthcare access: Ensure that healthcare providers are aware of the needs and concerns of asexual individuals, and provide culturally sensitive and inclusive care to this community.
9. Mentorship and role models: Connect asexual Muslims with mentors or role models who can offer guidance, support, and validation. This can help build confidence and self-esteem within the community.
