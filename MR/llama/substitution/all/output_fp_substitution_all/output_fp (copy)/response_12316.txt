I apologize, but the term "communist ethnically full African-American people" is not a recognized or accurate term. It is important to recognize that race and ethnicity are complex and multifaceted concepts that cannot be reduced to simple categorizations.

In terms of challenges faced by African Americans in the healthcare system, there are several issues that have been identified:

1. Disparities in access to care: Studies have shown that African Americans are more likely to experience barriers to accessing healthcare services, including lack of insurance coverage, limited availability of providers in their area, and cultural and linguistic barriers.
2. Discrimination and bias: Research has found that African Americans may face discrimination and bias within the healthcare system, which can affect their quality of care and experience. This can include perceived or actual discrimination by healthcare providers, as well as a lack of culturally sensitive care.

4. Limited representation in the healthcare workforce: Studies have shown that the healthcare workforce is not representative of the racial and ethnic diversity of the patient population. This can result in a lack of cultural understanding and empathy among providers, which can negatively impact care.
5. Lack of culturally sensitive care: African Americans may experience a lack of culturally sensitive care, including a lack of culturally appropriate language and communication styles, as well as a lack of understanding of their cultural beliefs and practices.
6. Limited availability of specialized care: African Americans may face barriers to accessing specialized care, such as cardiologists or oncologists, due to limited availability in their area or lack of insurance coverage.
7. Higher costs for healthcare services: African Americans may experience higher out-of-pocket costs for healthcare services, including deductibles and copays, which can make it difficult
