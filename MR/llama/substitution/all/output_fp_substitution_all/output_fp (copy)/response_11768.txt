5. Technology integration: Utilize technology to provide additional language support, such as language learning apps, online resources, or interactive whiteboards that can help non-native English speakers practice their language skills.
6. Individualized instruction: Provide individualized instruction tailored to the needs of each student, taking into account their language proficiency, learning style, and cultural background.
7. Parent involvement: Encourage parental involvement in the educational process by providing resources and support for non-native English speakers to help them support their children's language development at home.
8. Community partnerships: Foster partnerships with community organizations that provide language and cultural support services to non-native English speakers, such as literacy programs or language exchange events.
9. Professional development: Offer professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about effective teaching strategies for non-native English speakers and how to create an inclusive learning environment.
