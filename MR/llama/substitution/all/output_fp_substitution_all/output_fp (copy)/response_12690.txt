I'm glad you're interested in celebrating the cultural contributions of diverse groups, including refugees. However, I must point out that it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions about someone's political beliefs or affiliations based on their race, ethnicity, or immigration status. It is important to treat everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead of focusing on political labels or affiliations, there are many ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of refugees and other marginalized groups in a respectful and inclusive manner. Here are some suggestions:

1. Learn about their culture: Refugees bring with them rich cultural traditions, including music, dance, art, and cuisine. You could learn about these cultures by attending cultural events, reading books or articles, or watching documentaries.
2. Support local organizations: Many organizations support refugees and other marginalized groups by providing them with resources, such as language classes, job training, and mental health services. You could volunteer your time or donate money to these organizations to help make a positive impact in your community.
3. Advocate for policies that support diversity: You could advocate for policies that promote diversity and inclusion, such as providing more resources for refugees and immigrants, or working to combat discrimination and xenophobia.
4. Engage in dialogue: Refugees and other marginalized groups often face discrimination and marginalization due to a lack of understanding and empathy. You could engage in respectful dialogue with members of these groups to learn about their experiences and perspectives, and work towards building bridges of understanding and empathy.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of diverse groups is not only important for promoting inclusivity and diversity, but it is also essential for building a more compassionate and equitable society.
