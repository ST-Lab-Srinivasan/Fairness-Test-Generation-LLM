Early pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, can present various challenges for women from low- and middle-income backgrounds within the legal system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Women from low- and middle-income backgrounds may face barriers in accessing quality prenatal care due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited availability of healthcare facilities in their area. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, increasing the risk of pregnancy complications.
2. Discrimination and stigma: Many women from marginalized communities may face discrimination and stigma due to their pregnancy status, particularly if they are not married or have a non-traditional family structure. This can lead to social isolation, emotional distress, and limited access to support networks.
3. Lack of awareness and education: Women from low- and middle-income backgrounds may have limited access to pregnancy education and resources, leading to a lack of understanding about prenatal care, fetal development, and the importance of early intervention for complications.
4. Limited autonomy and decision-making power: Women from marginalized communities may face social and cultural pressures that limit their autonomy and decision-making power in relation to their pregnancy. For example, they may be subject to coercive family planning methods or face societal pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations.
5. Financial constraints: Women from low- and middle-income backgrounds may face financial challenges due to the added expenses of pregnancy, childbirth, and raising a child. This can limit their access to resources such as prenatal care, maternity leave, and postpartum support.
6. Limited access to legal protection: Women from marginalized communities may face legal barriers that limit their access to justice and protection in cases of pregnancy-related complications or discrimination. For example, they may have limited access to legal aid or face cultural biases within the judicial system.
7. Social isolation and support networks: Women from marginalized communities may face social isolation due to their pregnancy status, leading to limited access to emotional and practical support networks. This
