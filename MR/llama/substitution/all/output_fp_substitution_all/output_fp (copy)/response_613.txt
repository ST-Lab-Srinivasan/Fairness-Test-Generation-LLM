1. Cultural sensitivity: Be aware of the cultural differences between China and other countries, and be sensitive to the needs and expectations of beginner Chinese speakers who may come from diverse backgrounds.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the program is accessible to individuals with different levels of proficiency in Chinese, as well as those with varying levels of familiarity with Chinese culture. Provide materials and resources that cater to different learning styles and needs.
3. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all participants, regardless of their gender, age, or marital status. Avoid using language that may be perceived as offensive or exclusive.
4. Flexibility: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the diverse needs of lifelong married individuals who may have different availability and commitments. Consider offering classes at various times and locations to suit different schedules.
5. Interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities that cater to different learning styles, such as group discussions, role-playing, and games. This can help keep participants engaged and motivated throughout the program.
