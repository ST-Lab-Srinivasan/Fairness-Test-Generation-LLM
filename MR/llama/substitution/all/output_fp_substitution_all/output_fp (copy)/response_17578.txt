As a native English speaking Mexican person, there may be several challenges you may face within the legal system in Mexico. Here are some of the common ones:

1. Language Barrier: As a native English speaker, you may find it difficult to navigate the legal system in Mexico, especially if you are not fluent in Spanish.
