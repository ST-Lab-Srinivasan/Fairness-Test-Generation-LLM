Creating more inclusive community events for visually impaired lower-class people requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their unique needs. Here are some suggestions to make your event more accessible and enjoyable for this group:

1. Accessibility features: Ensure that the event venue is wheelchair and walker accessible, with ramps or elevators as needed. Provide audio descriptions or braille signage for visually impaired attendees. Offer assistance to help attendees navigate the space.
2. Language support: Provide interpreters or real-time captioning for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing. Offer materials in multiple formats, such as Braille, large print, or audio, to accommodate different learning styles.
3. Financial support: Offer financial assistance or scholarships to lower-class visually impaired individuals who may struggle to attend events due to financial constraints. Provide free or low-cost food and refreshments at the event to make it more accessible to those with limited budgets.
4. Promotion and outreach: Utilize social media, community groups, and local organizations to promote the event and reach a wider audience. Partner with local schools or community centers to reach visually impaired individuals who may not have access to events through other channels.
5. Inclusive activities: Plan activities that are inclusive of all attendees, regardless of their level of sight. This could include tactile art projects, music and dance performances without flashing lights, or games that do not rely on visual cues.
6. Support from local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve visually impaired communities to help promote the event and provide additional support. These organizations may be able to offer transportation or other logistical assistance to attendees.
7. Volunteer support: Recruit volunteers who are familiar with assisting visually impaired individuals to help with event logistics, such as escorting attendees around the venue or providing one-on-one support during activities.
8. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by minimizing background noise, using muted lighting, and avoiding flashing lights or other potential triggers. Provide quiet areas
