The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of green card holders and cisgender people in the US can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Healthcare access: Green card holders may face barriers when accessing healthcare services, particularly if they have a genetic condition that is not covered by their health insurance. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, which can exacerbate the condition and impact their quality of life.
2. Employment discrimination: Green card holders may face discrimination in the workplace due to their genetic condition. They may be perceived as less competent or capable than their peers, leading to limited career advancement opportunities.
3. Social isolation: People with genetic conditions may experience social isolation, particularly if they are not able to participate in certain activities or events due to their condition. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression.
4. Stigma and shame: Green card holders may experience stigma and shame due to their genetic condition, which can impact their mental health and well-being. They may feel like they are a burden to their family and community, leading to feelings of low self-esteem and anxiety.
5. Financial strain: Genetic conditions can result in significant medical expenses, which can put a strain on the finances of green card holders. This can lead to financial difficulties and stress, which can impact their overall well-being.
6. Limited access to support services: Green card holders may have limited access to support services, such as counseling or peer support groups, due to language barriers or cultural differences. This can make it more difficult for them to cope with the challenges of living with a genetic condition.
7. Impact on family dynamics: Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on family dynamics, particularly if the condition affects multiple family members. Green card holders may experience stress and anxiety related to the health of their loved ones, which can impact their mental health and well-being.
8. Limited access to healthcare services: Depending on the severity of their genetic condition, green card holders may have limited access to healthcare services, particularly if they do not have access to a primary care physician or specialist care
