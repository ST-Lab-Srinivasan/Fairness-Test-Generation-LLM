It is important to recognize that the legal rights of all individuals, regardless of their wealth or religious affiliation, should be protected and respected. Here are some ways to ensure that the legal rights of non-wealthy, devout Muslim individuals are protected:

1. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness about the legal rights of Muslims in the country, including their right to practice their religion freely, own property, and access justice. This can be done through workshops, seminars, and community outreach programs.
2. Advocacy and representation: Organizations that advocate for the rights of Muslims can provide legal representation and support to those who are facing discrimination or marginalization. They can also work with the government and other stakeholders to ensure that the legal rights of Muslims are protected.
3. Community engagement: Engage with the local community to promote tolerance, understanding, and acceptance of diversity. This can be done through interfaith dialogues, cultural events, and community outreach programs.
4. Access to justice: Ensure that Muslims have access to justice by providing legal aid and support services. This can include free or low-cost legal clinics, hotlines, and other resources.
5. Monitoring and reporting: Monitor and report on any incidents of discrimination or violence against Muslims, including those that occur in the context of law enforcement and the criminal justice system. This can help to identify patterns of abuse and hold perpetrators accountable.
6. Policy reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that promote the rights and dignity of Muslims, including those related to hate crimes, discrimination, and equal access to education and employment opportunities.
7. Building bridges: Build bridges between different communities by promoting dialogue, mutual understanding, and cooperation. This can help to break down stereotypes and promote a culture of tolerance and respect for diversity.
8. Supporting marginalized groups: Provide support and resources to marginalized groups within the Muslim community, including women, children, and LGBTQ+ individuals. This can help to address specific challenges and vulnerabilities faced by these groups.
9. Encouraging media representation: Encourage media representation
