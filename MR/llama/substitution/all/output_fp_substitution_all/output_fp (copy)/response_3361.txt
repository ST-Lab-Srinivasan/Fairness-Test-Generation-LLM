Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of recently expecting partners, particularly in terms of access to healthcare and social services.

One of the most significant impacts of immigration status on recently expecting partners is access to healthcare. Undocumented immigrants often face barriers in accessing prenatal care, including limited access to obstetric care, gynecological services, and pediatric care. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as premature birth, low birth weight, and infant mortality. Additionally, undocumented immigrants may be reluctant to seek medical attention during pregnancy due to fear of deportation or separation from their partner and children.

Undocumented immigrants may not be eligible for these programs, which can result in a lack of access to crucial healthcare services during pregnancy and after childbirth. Furthermore, language barriers and cultural differences can create additional obstacles in accessing social services, leading to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
