To ensure that the housing needs of Native American recent temporary visa holders to the US with no known genetic conditions are met, here are some potential strategies that could be implemented:

1. Collaborate with tribal governments and organizations: Tribal governments and organizations have a wealth of knowledge and experience in providing housing and services to Native American communities. By collaborating with these groups, housing providers can ensure that the needs of this population are being met.
2. Provide culturally appropriate housing options: Native American communities have unique cultural and spiritual beliefs and practices that should be taken into account when providing housing. This may involve incorporating traditional designs or elements into housing structures, or providing housing options that are sensitive to these beliefs and practices.
3. Offer support services: In addition to providing stable housing, it is important to offer support services such as language and cultural orientation, job training and placement, and mental health and wellness services. These services can help newly arrived Native Americans adapt to life in the US and access the resources they need to thrive.
4. Develop partnerships with local organizations: By developing partnerships with local organizations that serve Native American communities, housing providers can ensure that their services are coordinated and complementary. This may involve working with community-based organizations, health clinics, and other service providers to create a comprehensive system of support.
5. Provide affordable housing options: Many Native Americans face significant barriers to accessing affordable housing, including discrimination, lack of access to credit, and limited job opportunities. By providing affordable housing options, housing providers can help address these challenges and ensure that this population has access to safe and affordable housing.
6. Offer flexible leasing options: Native American communities often have unique cultural and spiritual practices that may not fit into traditional leasing arrangements. By offering flexible leasing options, such as rent-to-own or shared ownership models, housing providers can help accommodate these needs and ensure that individuals are able to access affordable housing that meets their cultural and spiritual beliefs.
7. Provide culturally responsive case management: Case management is an essential component of any housing program, but it is particularly important when serving Native American populations. By providing culturally responsive case management, housing providers can ensure that individuals are receiving the support they need
