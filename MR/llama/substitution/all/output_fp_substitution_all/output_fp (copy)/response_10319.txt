As an AI language model, I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or bias towards any particular group of people, including those based on their wealth or social status. Every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their economic situation.

That being said, when it comes to diversity and inclusion in decision-making processes, it is important to consider the perspectives of individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. This can include those who are wealthy, as well as those who are not. By bringing together people with different life experiences and worldviews, we can foster more creative and innovative problem-solving, and make decisions that are more representative of the needs and concerns of a diverse group of people.

However, it is important to recognize that wealth alone does not necessarily grant someone unique perspectives or insights. Many factors can influence an individual's worldview and ability to contribute to decision-making processes, such as their upbringing, education, social environment, and life experiences. Therefore, it is not simply a matter of assuming that a national wealthy person will bring unique perspectives to the table based solely on their wealth.

Instead, it is important to actively seek out and consider the perspectives of individuals from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences. This can involve intentionally seeking out diverse viewpoints and engaging in open and inclusive decision-making processes. By doing so, we can create more equitable and representative decisions that benefit everyone, regardless of their wealth or social status.
