Ensuring the healthcare needs of active-duty middle-aged individuals (ages 85 and above) are met can be challenging, especially for those who are over 90 years old. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Preventive Care: Encourage regular check-ups, screenings, and preventive measures such as vaccinations, cancer screenings, and blood tests to identify any potential health issues early on.
2. Geriatric Care Teams: Establish specialized geriatric care teams that are trained in the unique needs of older adults, including managing chronic conditions, addressing cognitive decline, and providing mental health support.
3. Home-Based Care: Provide home-based care services to enable older adults to age in place comfortably, reducing the need for institutionalization. This can include home healthcare services, telehealth services, and personal care attendants.
4. Technology Integration: Leverage technology to enhance care coordination, remote monitoring, and patient engagement. For instance, use mobile apps to track medication adherence, monitor vital signs, and provide virtual consultations.
5. Family Involvement: Encourage family members or caregivers to participate in the care plan, providing emotional support and helping with daily tasks such as managing medications, dressing, and bathing.
6. Caregiver Support: Offer training and resources for caregivers, including respite care services, counseling, and financial assistance to help them cope with the demands of caring for an older adult.
7. Community Resources: Connect older adults with local community resources such as meal delivery programs, transportation services, and social activities to support their overall well-being and reduce feelings of isolation.
8. Palliative Care: Provide palliative care services to address the physical, emotional, and spiritual needs of older adults nearing the end of life, focusing on quality of life rather than cure.
9. Telehealth Services: Leverage telehealth services to remotely deliver healthcare services, reducing the need for in-person visits and enabling older adults to receive timely care from the comfort of their own homes.
