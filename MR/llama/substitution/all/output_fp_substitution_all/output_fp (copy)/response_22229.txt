Introduction:
Ethnic minorities, including African Americans, are disproportionately affected by natural disasters and experience higher rates of mental health conditions post-disaster. However, existing research and response efforts often fail to consider the unique cultural and social factors that influence the mental health of this population. This article highlights the importance of culturally competent mental health care for ethnically diverse African American individuals in disaster response and outlines strategies for addressing their needs.

The Importance of Culturally Competent Mental Health Care:
Culturally competent mental health care recognizes the significance of cultural and social factors in shaping an individual's mental health experiences. It involves understanding the unique cultural values, beliefs, and practices that influence an individual's coping mechanisms and help-seeking behaviors. For African Americans, culturally competent mental health care involves recognizing the historical and contemporary impact of systemic racism on their mental health and well-being.
