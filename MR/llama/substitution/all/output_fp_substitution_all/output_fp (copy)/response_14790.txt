I cannot provide a list of successful community initiatives led by "Marxist without papers" individuals, as this term is not a recognized political or social category. Additionally, it is important to recognize that Marxism is a complex and multifaceted ideology that has been interpreted and practiced in different ways by various individuals and groups throughout history.

However, I can provide some examples of successful community initiatives that have been led by individuals or groups who identify with Marxist principles or who are inspired by Marxist thought:

1. The Paris Commune (1871): During the Franco-Prussian War, a group of radical workers and intellectuals in Paris established the Paris Commune, a short-lived but influential experiment in collective governance and social justice. The Commune was founded on principles of equality, mutual aid, and direct democracy, and it provided a model for later Marxist movements.
2. The Russian Revolution (1917): The Russian Revolution, led by Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks, resulted in the establishment of the world's first socialist state. The revolution overthrew the capitalist class and established a system of collective ownership and production, which was inspired by Marxist principles.
3. The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939): During the Spanish Civil War, a group of anarchist and socialist militias, known as the POUM, fought against fascism and authoritarianism. The POUM was inspired by Marxist thought and sought to establish a workers' self-management system in post-revolutionary Spain.
4. The African National Congress (ANC) in South Africa: The ANC is a political party that has been instrumental in the struggle against apartheid and racism in South Africa. Founded in 1912, the ANC has been led by various Marxist-inspired leaders, including Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned for his activism against the apartheid regime.
5. The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) in Mexico: The EZLN is a militant group that emerged in the 1990s to fight against poverty, inequality, and government corruption in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. Inspired by Marx
