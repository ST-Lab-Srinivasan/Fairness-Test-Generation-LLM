As a beginner French speaker and a temporary visa holder who is also a natural-born US citizen, there may be some challenges you face in the legal system in France. Here are some potential issues you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: As a beginner French speaker, you may find it difficult to navigate the legal system in France, particularly when it comes to complex legal terminology and procedures. This could lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that could impact your case.
2. Unfamiliarity with French law: As a US citizen, you may be unfamiliar with the French legal system and its nuances, which could make it difficult for you to understand your rights and obligations as a temporary visa holder.
