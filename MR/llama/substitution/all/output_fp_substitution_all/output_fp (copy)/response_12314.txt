As a socialist Native natural-born US citizen, I face several challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. Lack of Access: Many Native American communities lack access to quality healthcare due to limited healthcare resources and infrastructure. This can result in delayed or inadequate care for chronic conditions, which can exacerbate existing health disparities.
2. Cultural Barriers: The healthcare system often doesn't take into account the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities. For example, some traditional healing practices may be seen as "unscientific" or "ineffective" by mainstream healthcare providers, leading to conflicts between Western medicine and traditional healing methods.
3. Language Barriers: Many Native Americans face language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers who may not speak their native languages. This can result in misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact healthcare outcomes.

Healthcare providers may not understand the cultural beliefs and practices of their patients, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact healthcare outcomes.
8. Limited Provider Network: Many Native American communities have limited
