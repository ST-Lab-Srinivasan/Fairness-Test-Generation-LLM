Introduction:

The marital status of a person can have significant impacts on their life, including their language learning experience. As a beginner French speaker, the marital status of an individual can affect their motivation, confidence, and overall language acquisition process. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner French speakers.

Research Questions:

1. What is the demographic distribution of beginner French speakers based on their marital status?
2. How does the marital status of a beginner French speaker affect their motivation to learn the language?
3. Does the marital status of a beginner French speaker influence their confidence in using the language?
4. What are the specific challenges faced by beginner French speakers based on their marital status?
5. How can the impacts of marital status on beginner French speakers be addressed in language learning programs?

Literature Review:

Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect language learning outcomes (Grabe, 2013). For example, married individuals tend to have higher motivation and confidence in language learning due to the social support they receive from their spouse (Kim, 2016). On the other hand, unmarried individuals may face challenges such as limited social support and pressure from family members to focus on career rather than language learning (Bardají & Mascaró, 2014).

Methodology:

This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of beginner French speakers, collecting demographic information and language learning outcomes. Additionally, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants to gather more in-depth insights into their experiences as beginner French speakers based on their marital status.

Significance:

This study aims to contribute to the existing literature on the impacts of marital status on language learning outcomes. The findings will provide valuable insights for language teachers and educators, enabling them to better support beginner French speakers from diverse marital backgrounds. By addressing the challenges faced by unmarried individuals, this study can help promote more inclusive language learning programs that cater to the needs
