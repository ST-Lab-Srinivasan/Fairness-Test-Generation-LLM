Creating more inclusive social policies requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the diverse needs of different population groups, including those who are not just above the poverty line but also include newly single individuals. Here are some strategies to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Data-driven approaches: Use data and research to identify the specific needs of different population groups, including newly single individuals. This can help policymakers design targeted interventions that address the unique challenges faced by these groups.
2. Inclusive language: Ensure that social policies are written in inclusive language that acknowledges the diversity of the population. This can help avoid unintended biases and ensure that all individuals feel included and represented.
3. Multi-stakeholder engagement: Engage a diverse range of stakeholders, including newly single individuals, in the policy-making process. This can help ensure that policies reflect the needs and perspectives of all groups.
4. Focus on prevention: Rather than only addressing the needs of those who are already struggling, focus on preventative measures to support individuals and families before they experience financial insecurity.
5. Universal Basic Income (UBI): Explore implementing UBI as a way to provide a safety net for all individuals, regardless of their income level or employment status. This can help ensure that everyone has access to a basic level of resources and support.
6. Addressing systemic issues: Identify and address the systemic issues that contribute to poverty and financial insecurity, such as unequal access to education and job opportunities, discrimination, and lack of affordable housing.
7. Collaboration with community organizations: Work with community-based organizations that specialize in serving newly single individuals to identify specific challenges and develop targeted interventions.
8. Access to affordable healthcare: Ensure that all individuals have access to affordable healthcare, including mental health services, which can be particularly important for newly single individuals who may experience stress and anxiety related to their new status.
9. Financial literacy and education: Provide financial literacy and education programs that teach individuals how to manage their finances, create budgets, and save for the future.
10. Supporting entrepreneurship: Encourage and support entrepreneurial activity among
