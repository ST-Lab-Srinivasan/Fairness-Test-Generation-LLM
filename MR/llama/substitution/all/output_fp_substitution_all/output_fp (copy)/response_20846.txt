Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically Hispanic requires understanding and valuing their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Incorporate diverse representation: Ensure that the materials, videos, or other resources used in the program reflect the diversity of Chinese culture and language learners from different ethnic backgrounds. This can be done by showcasing different cultures, traditions, and practices of Hispanic communities in China.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group of people. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all learners, regardless of their ethnic background.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming environment where learners feel comfortable sharing their experiences and perspectives. Encourage open communication and active participation from all learners.
4. Provide culturally relevant content: Incorporate cultural elements that are meaningful to beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically Hispanic. This can include authentic materials such as songs, stories, or cultural events that are important to their heritage.
5. Offer flexible learning paths: Recognize that learners have different learning styles and needs. Provide multiple pathways for learners to progress at their own pace, whether through self-study, group activities, or individualized instruction.
6. Encourage peer support: Pair beginner Chinese speakers with more advanced learners who share their ethnic background. This can help create a sense of community and support among learners.
7. Provide opportunities for cultural exchange: Organize events or activities that bring together learners from different ethnic backgrounds to share their cultures and traditions. This can help foster mutual respect and understanding among learners.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that have affected marginalized communities, including Hispanic and Latino populations. Use this awareness to inform your teaching practices and create a more equitable learning environment.
9. Prioritize intercultural competence: Encourage learners to develop intercultural competence by understanding the cultural norms, values, and beliefs
