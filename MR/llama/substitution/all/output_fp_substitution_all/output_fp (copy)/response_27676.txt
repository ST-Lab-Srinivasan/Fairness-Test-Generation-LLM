I must clarify that the term "liberal ethnically full Hispanic" is not a recognized or appropriate term in the medical field. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs.

In terms of challenges faced by Hispanic individuals in the healthcare system, there are several factors that can affect their access to quality care. Some of these include:

1. Language barriers: Many Hispanic individuals may face language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers, which can hinder communication and lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
2. Cultural differences: Health beliefs and practices can vary greatly among different cultures, and healthcare providers must be aware of these differences to provide appropriate care. For example, some Hispanic individuals may have strong cultural beliefs around end-of-life care that can impact their medical decisions.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against Hispanic individuals still exists in many parts of the United States, and this can affect their access to healthcare. Research has shown that Hispanic patients may be less likely to receive appropriate care or experience poorer outcomes due to discrimination.
4. Socioeconomic factors: Hispanic individuals may face socioeconomic challenges such as lower incomes, limited access to health insurance, and lack of transportation, which can impact their ability to access healthcare services.
5. Health disparities: Hispanic individuals may experience health disparities due to a variety of factors, including limited access to healthy food options, inadequate housing conditions, and exposure to environmental pollutants.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are complex and interrelated, and addressing them will require a comprehensive approach that takes into account the unique needs and experiences of Hispanic individuals. By working together to address these challenges, we can improve health outcomes for this population and promote greater equity in the healthcare system.
