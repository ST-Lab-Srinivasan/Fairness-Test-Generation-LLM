Creating more inclusive social policies for bourgeois partnered individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers faced by this group. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize the diversity of bourgeois partnerships: Bourgeois partnerships come in various forms, including heterosexual and LGBTQ+ couples, as well as interracial and interfaith couples. Social policies should recognize and respect this diversity, rather than assuming a monolithic view of marriage and partnership.
2. Address economic inequality: Bourgeois partnerships are often characterized by significant economic disparities between partners. Social policies should aim to reduce these inequalities through progressive taxation, social welfare programs, and access to affordable healthcare.
3. Promote work-life balance: Bourgeois partners may face pressure to prioritize their careers over their personal lives, leading to burnout and stress. Social policies should promote work-life balance by providing flexible work arrangements, parental leave, and other forms of support.
4. Challenge gender roles and stereotypes: Traditional gender roles and stereotypes can limit the potential of bourgeois partners, particularly women. Social policies should challenge these norms by promoting gender equality and providing opportunities for men and women to pursue their interests and goals without facing discrimination or marginalization.
5. Provide access to education and training: Bourgeois partners may benefit from access to educational and training programs that help them develop new skills and knowledge. Social policies should prioritize investments in education, particularly for those who may have historically been excluded from opportunities for advancement.
6. Support mental health and well-being: The pressures of bourgeois life can take a toll on mental health and well-being. Social policies should prioritize mental health support and provide resources for individuals to manage stress, anxiety, and other mental health concerns.
7. Address social isolation: Bourgeois partners may experience social isolation due to the demands of their professional and personal lives. Social policies should promote community engagement and social connection by providing opportunities for volunteer work, social events, and other forms of social interaction.
