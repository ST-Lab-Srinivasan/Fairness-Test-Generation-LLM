The impact of military status on the lives of non-democratic employed individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Lack of job security: Non-democratic regimes may not provide the same level of job security as democratic governments, which can make it difficult for individuals to plan their careers or make long-term financial decisions.
2. Limited career advancement opportunities: In non-democratic regimes, there may be limited opportunities for career advancement, particularly for those in the military or other security forces. This can lead to a lack of professional growth and development.
3. Political repression: Non-democratic regimes often use political repression as a means of maintaining power. This can include suppressing dissent, restricting civil liberties, and targeting individuals who are seen as threats to the regime. This can lead to a climate of fear and uncertainty, which can be detrimental to an individual's mental health and well-being.
4. Economic inequality: Non-democratic regimes often perpetuate economic inequality by favoring certain groups or individuals over others. This can lead to a lack of economic opportunities for non-privileged individuals, including those in the military.
5. Lack of social mobility: In non-democratic regimes, social mobility may be limited due to the rigidity of social hierarchies and the lack of opportunities for advancement. This can make it difficult for individuals to improve their socio-economic status, regardless of their military status.
6. Isolation from civil society: Non-democratic regimes may isolate individuals from civil society, including those in the military. This can limit their access to information and resources, as well as their ability to participate in civic activities.
7. Lack of transparency and accountability: Non-democratic regimes often lack transparency and accountability, which can make it difficult for individuals to know how the military is being managed or how resources are being allocated.
8. Corruption and cronyism: Non-democratic regimes may perpetuate corruption and cronyism, which can lead to a lack of trust in the military and the government more broadly.
