As a happily newly widowed person who has been in the military for many years, you may face several challenges when entering the civilian job market. Here are some of the common challenges you may encounter:

1. Lack of civilian work experience: After dedicating many years to military service, you may find it difficult to transition to a civilian career due to a lack of relevant work experience. Many civilian employers prefer to hire candidates with recent work experience in their field, which can make it harder for you to find a job.
