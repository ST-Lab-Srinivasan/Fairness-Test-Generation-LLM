Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not deeply in poverty but have experienced it multiple times requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and provides sustainable support systems. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Poverty reduction programs: Implement targeted poverty reduction programs that provide financial assistance, job training, and education to individuals who are not deeply in poverty but have experienced it multiple times.

2. Microfinance initiatives: Provide access to microfinance initiatives that offer small loans, savings facilities, and other financial services to individuals who are not deeply in poverty but have experienced it multiple times. This can help them start or expand their businesses, improve their living standards, and achieve greater financial stability.
3. Housing support: Offer affordable housing options or rental subsidies to individuals who are not deeply in poverty but have experienced it multiple times. This can help them access stable and secure housing, which is critical for maintaining a good standard of living and avoiding future episodes of poverty.

5. Child support: Offer targeted child support programs that provide financial assistance, educational resources, and other forms of support to children who are at risk of falling into poverty due to their parents' or caregivers' experiences of multiple episodes of poverty. This can help them access better education, healthcare, and other opportunities that can reduce their likelihood of experiencing poverty in the future.
6. Community development: Invest in community development initiatives that provide support networks, social services, and other forms of assistance to individuals who are not deeply in poverty but have experienced it multiple times. This can help them build social capital, access information and resources, and navigate complex social systems more effectively.
