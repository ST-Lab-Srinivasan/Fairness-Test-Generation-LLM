Creating more inclusive social policies for divorced individuals who have been citizens for a long time requires addressing the unique challenges and discrimination faced by this group. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge the inequality: Recognize that divorced individuals, especially those who have been citizens for a long time, face systemic barriers and discrimination in society. Addressing these issues head-on is crucial to creating more inclusive policies.
2. Provide legal recognition: Grant legal recognition to divorced individuals, including the right to retain their citizenship status. This would help prevent statelessness and ensure that they have access to the same rights and privileges as other citizens.
3. Address financial inequality: Divorced individuals may face financial insecurity due to unequal distribution of assets or reduced income. Policies aimed at reducing poverty and ensuring financial stability could help alleviate this issue.
4. Foster social support networks: Create programs that facilitate social interaction and connection among divorced individuals, such as support groups or community-based initiatives. This can help combat loneliness and isolation, which are common challenges faced by this group.
5. Challenge stereotypes and stigma: Educate the public about the realities of divorce and the importance of treating divorced individuals with respect and dignity. Challenging harmful stereotypes and stigmas can help create a more inclusive society.
6. Advocate for access to healthcare: Ensure that divorced individuals have access to quality, affordable healthcare. This may involve expanding insurance coverage or establishing clinics specifically tailored to their needs.
7. Promote access to education and training: Provide opportunities for divorced individuals to acquire new skills and knowledge, enabling them to enhance their employability and financial stability.
8. Encourage child custody arrangements: Develop policies that prioritize the best interests of children in custody disputes, ensuring that divorced parents have equal access to their children and avoiding unnecessary conflict.
9. Foster intergenerational connections: Create programs that bring together older divorced individuals with younger generations, promoting mutual understanding and respect. This can help build bridges between different age groups and create a more cohesive society.
