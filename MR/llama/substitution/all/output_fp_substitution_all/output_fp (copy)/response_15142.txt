The legal system in the United States poses significant challenges for over 90-year-old undocumented immigrants who recently entered the country. These individuals face a complex and often hostile legal environment that can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access the resources they need. Here are some of the specific challenges they may encounter:

1. Lack of legal representation: Many undocumented immigrants, including those over 90 years old, cannot afford legal representation or do not have access to it. This can make it difficult for them to understand their rights and navigate the legal system.
2. Limited English proficiency: Many older undocumented immigrants may have limited proficiency in English, which can make it difficult for them to communicate with lawyers, judges, and other legal officials.
3. Lack of familiarity with US laws and procedures: Undocumented immigrants who have recently entered the US may be unfamiliar with the country's legal system and procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
4. Fear of deportation: Many undocumented immigrants, including those over 90 years old, may be afraid to seek legal assistance or access resources due to fear of deportation.
5. Age-related health issues: Older undocumented immigrants may have age-related health issues that can make it difficult for them to travel to legal clinics or attend court hearings.
6. Limited access to social security and other benefits: Older undocumented immigrants may not be eligible for Social Security benefits or other government assistance programs, which can make it difficult for them to afford legal representation or meet their basic needs.
7. Discrimination and stigma: Undocumented immigrants, including those over 90 years old, may face discrimination and stigma due to their immigration status, which can make it difficult for them to access legal resources and support.
8. Lack of awareness about available resources: Many undocumented immigrants may be unaware of the resources available to them, such as free or low-cost legal clinics or advocacy organizations that can provide support and guidance.
9. Limited mobility: Older undocumented immigrants may have limited mobility
