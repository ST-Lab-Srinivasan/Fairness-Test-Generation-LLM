Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers who are ethnically Hispanic requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Use language that is accessible and respectful: Avoid using complex vocabulary or idioms that may be difficult for beginner English speakers to understand. Instead, use simple and clear language that is easy to follow. Be mindful of cultural references or expressions that may be unfamiliar to your audience.
2. Provide interpretive services: Offer interpretive services such as live interpretation, video remote interpreting, or written translations to help non-English speakers participate fully in the program. This can include providing headsets or other equipment for remote interpretation.
3. Use visual aids and props: Visual aids and props can help to make cultural programs more engaging and interactive for beginner English speakers. Consider using images, videos, or objects that are relevant to the cultural theme being presented.
4. Offer bilingual programming: Consider offering bilingual programming, where content is presented in both English and the language of the target audience. This can help to create a more inclusive environment and make it easier for non-English speakers to participate.
5. Provide cultural orientation: Offer cultural orientation sessions or workshops that provide an overview of the cultural practices and customs being presented in the program. This can help to set expectations and create a more inclusive environment.
6. Encourage participation: Encourage participants to share their own experiences and perspectives, and provide opportunities for questions and discussion. This can help to create a more interactive and engaging experience for all participants.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential power dynamics at play in cultural programs, particularly when working with beginner English speakers from marginalized communities. Take steps to ensure that all participants feel valued and included, such as actively seeking feedback and input from the community.
8. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where all participants feel welcome and included. Encourage participants to share their own cultural practices and traditions, and provide opportunities for connection and collaboration.
9. Be open to feedback: Be open to feedback and suggestions from participants, and be willing to adapt
