Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, who may not be in a romantic relationship, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Establish a comfortable and welcoming environment where everyone feels free to express their opinions without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done by setting clear ground rules for the group, encouraging active listening, and fostering a culture of mutual respect.
2. Use non-traditional participation methods: Consider using alternative methods for decision-making, such as online polls, anonymous surveys, or collaborative brainstorming sessions. These can help ensure that all voices are heard, regardless of their level of proficiency in Chinese.
3. Provide language support: Offer language support and resources to beginner Chinese speakers, such as translation services or interpretation during meetings. This can help level the playing field and ensure that everyone has equal opportunities to participate.
4. Foster a culture of mentorship: Encourage more proficient Chinese speakers to mentor and support their peers, particularly those who may be less experienced. This can help build relationships and create a sense of community, while also ensuring that the voices of beginner speakers are heard.
5. Use visual aids and multimedia: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to facilitate communication and decision-making processes. This can be particularly helpful for beginner Chinese speakers who may struggle with verbal communication.
6. Provide opportunities for practice: Offer regular practice sessions or activities that allow beginner Chinese speakers to interact with each other and build their confidence in using the language. This can help them feel more comfortable and confident in participating in decision-making processes.
7. Address power dynamics: Be aware of any existing power imbalances within the group, such as differences in proficiency level or cultural background. Take steps to address these imbalances by providing equal opportunities for participation and ensuring that all voices are heard.
8. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage a culture of inclusivity and respect, where everyone feels valued and appreciated. This can help create a more equitable and just decision-making process.
9. Use technology to facilitate communication
