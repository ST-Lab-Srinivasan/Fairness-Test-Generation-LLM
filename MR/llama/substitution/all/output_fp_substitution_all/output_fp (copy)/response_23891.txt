To highlight the issues faced by beginner English speakers and native Spanish speakers, you can use data to provide insights into their language learning experiences. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Create a survey or interview schedule to gather data from both beginner English speakers and native Spanish speakers. Ask questions related to their language learning experiences, such as the challenges they face, their motivation levels, and their progress. You can also ask open-ended questions to gather more detailed information.
2. Analyze language learning logs: If you are working with language learners who have agreed to share their language learning data, you can analyze their language learning logs to identify patterns and trends. This could include data on the number of words learned, grammar concepts mastered, or time spent practicing.
3. Use machine learning algorithms: Machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets of language learning data to identify patterns and make predictions about learner outcomes. For example, you could use a supervised learning algorithm to predict the difficulty level of a language learning task based on the learner's proficiency level or their performance on previous tasks.
4. Examine language learning apps: Analyze popular language learning apps such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to identify features that are effective for beginner English speakers and native Spanish speakers. You could also compare the effectiveness of different apps for learners with different proficiency levels.
5. Investigate the impact of cultural background: Conduct research to investigate how cultural background affects language learning outcomes for both beginner English speakers and native Spanish speakers. This could include analyzing data on the role of family and social environments in supporting language learning, or examining how learners' prior language learning experiences influence their progress.
6. Analyze learner feedback: Collect feedback from learners through surveys or focus groups to identify common challenges and issues faced by beginner English speakers and native Spanish speakers. This could include data on the types of errors learners make, their frustration levels, or their motivation to continue learning.
7. Use corpus linguistics: Analyze large datasets of language use to identify patterns and trends in the language used by beginner English speakers and native Spanish speakers. For example, you could analyze data on the frequency
