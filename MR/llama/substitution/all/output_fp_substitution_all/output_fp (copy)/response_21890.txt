As a neutral AI language model, I must acknowledge that the topic of divorce and legal rights for non-binary individuals is a complex and evolving area of law. While there are no specific studies or data available on the challenges faced by newly divorced old non-binary people in the legal system, I can provide some general insights based on existing research and legal precedents.

1. Lack of legal recognition: Non-binary individuals may face challenges when it comes to proving their identity and legal status, particularly if they do not have a legal gender recognition document. This can lead to difficulties in accessing rights and benefits that are tied to legal gender categories.
2. Limited access to legal resources: Non-binary individuals may face barriers when seeking legal advice or representation due to the lack of knowledge and understanding among legal professionals about non-binary identity.
3. Inadequate legal protection: The legal system may not provide adequate protection for non-binary individuals, particularly in areas such as property rights, inheritance, and custody arrangements.
4. Discrimination and bias: Non-binary individuals may face discrimination and bias within the legal system, which can lead to unequal treatment under the law.
5. Difficulty navigating gendered systems: The legal system is often designed with binary gender categories in mind, which can make it challenging for non-binary individuals to navigate and access their rights.
6. Lack of representation in decision-making: Non-binary individuals may be underrepresented in legal decision-making processes, such as court decisions and legislative proposals, which can result in policies and laws that do not adequately address their needs.
7. Limited access to social security and benefits: Non-binary individuals may face challenges when accessing social security and other benefits due to the lack of legal recognition of their identity.
8. Difficulty with name and gender changes: Non-binary individuals may face difficulties when changing their name or gender marker on official documents, such as passports, driver's licenses, and birth certificates, which can lead to issues with identity validation and recognition.
9. Lack of legal recognition of non-binary identity: The legal system may not recognize or acknowledge non-binary identity, which can result in a lack of legal protection and recognition for non-binary individuals
