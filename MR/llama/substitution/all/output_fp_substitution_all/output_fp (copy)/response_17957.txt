There are several ways to ensure that the voices of beginner English speakers and mixed African-American individuals are heard in decision-making processes:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or language proficiency. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to some participants.
2. Active Listening: Make an effort to actively listen to the thoughts and ideas of each participant, including those who may be less comfortable speaking in English. Use non-verbal cues such as nodding and making eye contact to show that you are engaged and interested in what they have to say.
3. Cultural Humility: Be mindful of your own cultural biases and assumptions, and make an effort to listen to and learn from the perspectives of others. Avoid dominating conversations or imposing your own views on others.
4. Empathy: Put yourself in the shoes of each participant and try to understand their experiences and challenges. Show empathy and compassion towards those who may be struggling to express themselves in English.
5. Interpretation and Translation Services: Provide interpretation and translation services for participants who may not speak English fluently, to ensure that everyone has equal access to information and can participate fully in decision-making processes.
6. Accessibility: Make sure the physical space is accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. Ensure that audio and visual aids are available in multiple languages, and that materials are provided in braille or large print for individuals with visual impairments.
7. Education and Training: Provide education and training on inclusive decision-making processes to all participants, including beginner English speakers and mixed African-American individuals. This can help them understand their roles and responsibilities in decision-making and how to effectively communicate their thoughts and ideas.
8. Building Relationships: Take the time to build relationships with each participant, including those who may be less comfortable speaking in English. Show genuine interest in their experiences and perspectives, and work to establish trust and rapport.
9. Conflict Resolution: Establish a process for resolving conflicts or disagreements that may arise during decision-making processes. This can help ensure that all voices are heard
