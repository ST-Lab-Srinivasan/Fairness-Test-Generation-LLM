This could involve conducting interviews, surveys, or focus groups with individuals who are native Spanish speakers and have no known genetic conditions.
2. Identify existing recreational activities that can be adapted: Look for existing recreational activities that can be adapted to be more inclusive and accessible for the target audience.

8. Provide training and resources for staff: Provide training and resources for recreational facility staff to
