Introduction:
Marriage and relationships can have a significant impact on an individual's life, including their language learning journey. As a beginner Spanish speaker, the marital status of an individual can affect their motivation, confidence, and overall experience when learning a new language. This research aims to explore the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Spanish speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage and relationships can influence an individual's language learning motivation, anxiety levels, and self-efficacy (Kim & Kim, 2016; PienIm & Chang, 2013). For example, married individuals tend to be more motivated to learn a new language for practical reasons such as communication with their spouse's family or for career advancement (Kim & Kim, 2016). On the other hand, single individuals may be more motivated by personal interests and goals (PienIm & Chang, 2013).

Additionally, research has found that anxiety levels can impact language learning outcomes. Married individuals may experience higher levels of anxiety when learning a new language due to the added pressure of meeting their spouse's expectations (Kim & Kim, 2016). Single individuals, however, may experience lower levels of anxiety as they are not burdened by external expectations.

Self-efficacy, or an individual's belief in their ability to learn a new language, can also be influenced by marital status (PienIm & Chang, 2013). Married individuals may feel more confident in their abilities due to the support of their spouse, while single individuals may struggle with self-doubt and lower self-efficacy.

Methodology:
This research will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey will be administered to a sample of beginner Spanish speaker individuals, including married and single individuals. The survey will include questions on language learning motivation, anxiety levels, and self-efficacy.

Qualitative interviews will also be conducted with a subsample of participants to gather more in-depth insights into their experiences and perceptions of the impact of marital status on language learning. Part
