As a language model, I can suggest some potential legislative changes that could benefit beginner French speakers who are also members of long-time active duty military communities:

1. Language Training Programs: Provide additional resources and funding for language training programs specifically designed for military personnel who are learning French as a second language. This could include on-base language classes, online courses, or tutoring services.
2. Cultural Immersion Programs: Organize cultural immersion programs that allow military personnel to immerse themselves in French culture and practice their language skills in a real-world setting. This could include trips to France, Quebec, or other French-speaking countries.
3. Language Proficiency Testing: Develop standardized language proficiency tests for military personnel learning French, and provide incentives for those who achieve high scores. This could help identify individuals who are proficient in French and provide recognition for their efforts.
4. Cross-Cultural Training: Provide training on cultural norms, customs, and etiquette specific to the French-speaking world. This could help military personnel better understand and navigate these cultures when conducting business or operations.
5. Language Loan Programs: Establish language loan programs that allow military personnel to borrow French language learning materials, such as textbooks, audio CDs, or language learning apps, at no cost or at a reduced cost.
6. On-Base Support: Provide on-base support for military personnel learning French, such as language classes, tutoring services, or cultural events. This could help create a sense of community and provide opportunities for military personnel to practice their language skills in a supportive environment.
7. Language Exchange Programs: Organize language exchange programs that pair beginner French speakers with more advanced learners or native speakers. This could provide an opportunity for beginners to practice speaking and listening to French in a real-world setting.
8. Virtual Learning Platforms: Develop virtual learning platforms that offer French language courses, cultural insights, and language learning resources specifically designed for military personnel. These platforms could be accessible from any location and offer flexible scheduling options.
9. Language Skills Assessment: Develop language skills assessments that evaluate the proficiency of military personnel in French. This could help identify areas where individuals need improvement and provide targeted language training
