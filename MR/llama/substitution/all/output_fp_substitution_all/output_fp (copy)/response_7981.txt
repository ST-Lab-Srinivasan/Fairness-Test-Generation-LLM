As an AI language model, I cannot provide legal advice or predict the future of any individual's case. However, I can provide some general information about the challenges that advanced aged (65 and over 85) natural-born US citizen people may face in the legal system:

1. Ageism: Unfortunately, ageism is a common problem in many areas of society, including the legal system. Older adults may face discrimination or stereotyping based on their age, which can affect their legal rights and experiences.
2. Health issues: As people age, they may experience physical or cognitive decline, which can impact their ability to navigate the legal system. They may need additional support or accommodations to access legal services.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Older adults may face barriers in accessing legal resources such as legal aid organizations, pro bono lawyers, or other forms of legal assistance. This can be due to a lack of availability in their area, financial constraints, or other factors.
4. Difficulty navigating complex legal processes: The legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with the process. Older adults may face challenges in understanding legal terminology, procedures, and timelines.
5. Limited access to technology: Many older adults may not be as comfortable or familiar with technology as younger individuals, which can impact their ability to access legal resources or communicate with lawyers remotely.
6. Lack of knowledge about available legal options: Older adults may be unaware of the legal options available to them, such as powers of attorney, wills, trusts, or other estate planning tools. They may also be unfamiliar with the legal processes involved in these options.
7. Limited support systems: Older adults may face challenges in accessing support systems, such as family members or caregivers, who can assist them in navigating the legal system.
8. Language barriers: For older adults who are non-native English speakers, language barriers can create additional challenges in accessing legal resources and communicating with lawyers.
9. Limited mobility: Older adults may face mobility issues that make it difficult for them to travel to legal appointments or access legal services.
