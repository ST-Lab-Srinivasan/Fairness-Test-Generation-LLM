Promoting the economic empowerment of non-liberal natural-born US citizen communities is crucial for addressing income inequality and ensuring that all individuals have access to economic opportunities. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to promote economic empowerment:

1. Education and job training programs: Providing access to quality education and job training programs can help individuals acquire the skills they need to compete in the job market. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and certificate programs.
2. Small business development: Supporting small businesses owned by non-liberal natural-born US citizen communities through access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities can help create jobs and stimulate economic growth.
3. Community development financial institutions (CDFI): CDFI's are specialized financial institutions that provide loans, investments, and other financial services to low-income and underserved communities. Supporting the growth of CDFI's can help increase access to capital for non-liberal natural-born US citizen communities.
4. Access to affordable housing: Ensuring that non-liberal natural-born US citizen communities have access to affordable housing can help reduce housing costs and improve overall quality of life.
5. Criminal justice reform: Addressing the systemic issues in the criminal justice system that disproportionately affect non-liberal natural-born US citizen communities, such as racial bias and discrimination, can help reduce mass incarceration and improve economic opportunities for these communities.
6. Healthcare access: Ensuring that non-liberal natural-born US citizen communities have access to quality healthcare can help improve overall health outcomes and reduce health disparities.
7. Community land trusts: Community land trusts are nonprofit organizations that hold land for the benefit of a community, rather than private individuals. This can help preserve affordable housing and promote economic development in non-liberal natural-born US citizen communities.
8. Cooperative ownership: Cooperative ownership structures, such as worker cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, can help non-liberal natural-born US citizen communities own and control businesses, which can lead to greater economic empowerment.
9. Public-private partnerships
