It is not appropriate or ethical to provide medical care or financial support based on a person's social class or genetic predisposition. Everyone has the right to receive quality medical care and support, regardless of their background or genetic makeup. It is important to recognize that individuals with genetic conditions are not inherently "elite" or "upper-class," but rather human beings who deserve dignity and respect.

Instead of focusing on the social class or genetic status of individuals, it is more important to ensure that they have access to appropriate medical care and support. This can involve:

1. Providing education and resources: Offering educational materials and resources on genetic conditions, their causes, symptoms, and treatment options can help individuals and their families make informed decisions about their care.
2. Accessing financial assistance: Organizations such as patient advocacy groups, non-profit organizations, and government agencies may offer financial assistance programs to help cover the costs of medical care and treatments.
3. Promoting inclusive healthcare policies: Advocating for policies that promote inclusivity and equal access to healthcare can help ensure that individuals with genetic conditions receive the same level of care as those without these conditions.
4. Reducing stigma: Efforts to reduce stigma and discrimination against individuals with genetic conditions can help create a more supportive and inclusive environment for everyone.
5. Encouraging early intervention: Early intervention and treatment can help manage the symptoms of genetic conditions and improve quality of life.
6. Fostering a supportive community: Connecting individuals with genetic conditions to a supportive community of peers, family members, and healthcare professionals can help them feel less isolated and more empowered to manage their condition.
7. Advocating for research and development: Supporting research and development into new treatments and therapies for genetic conditions can help improve the quality of life for individuals affected by these conditions.

In summary, ensuring that the financial needs of individuals with genetic conditions are met involves providing education, access to financial assistance programs, promoting inclusive healthcare policies, reducing stigma, encouraging early intervention, fostering a supportive community, and advocating for research and development.
