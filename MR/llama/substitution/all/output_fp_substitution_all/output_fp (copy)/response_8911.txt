Supporting the professional aspirations of physically able-bodied very young individuals, particularly those in their 90s or older, can be challenging but rewarding. Here are some ways to support their professional aspirations:

1. Encourage and facilitate lifelong learning: Many older adults have a strong desire to continue learning and growing professionally. Provide access to educational resources, workshops, and training programs that can help them develop new skills or enhance existing ones.
2. Offer mentorship opportunities: Connect your 90-year-old relative with experienced professionals in their field of interest. This can provide valuable guidance, networking opportunities, and a fresh perspective on their professional aspirations.
3. Help them identify their strengths and passions: Encourage your relative to reflect on what they enjoy doing and what they're good at. This can help them identify potential career paths or areas of interest that they may want to explore further.
4. Support entrepreneurial ventures: If your relative has an business idea, consider providing resources and support to help them get started. This could involve connecting them with mentors, offering financial assistance, or simply providing encouragement and moral support.
5. Help them stay up-to-date with industry trends: Many older adults may feel out of touch with the latest developments in their field. Help your relative stay current by sharing relevant articles, attend conferences or events together, or introducing them to peers who can provide insight and advice.
6. Foster connections with peers: Social isolation can be a challenge for older adults, particularly those who are no longer working full-time. Encourage your relative to connect with other professionals in their field through networking events, join professional organizations, or participate in online communities.
7. Create opportunities for community engagement: Many older adults find meaning and purpose in giving back to their communities. Help your relative identify volunteer opportunities that align with their interests and skills, such as mentoring, teaching, or serving on a board of directors.
8. Advocate for flexible work arrangements: Encourage your employer to offer flexible work arrangements, such as part-time or remote work, that can help your relative continue working while balancing other responsibilities.
