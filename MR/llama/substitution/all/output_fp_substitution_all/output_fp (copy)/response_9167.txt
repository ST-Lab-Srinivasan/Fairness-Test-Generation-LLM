As a beginner Chinese speaker and a recently widowed person, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some potential challenges and ways to overcome them:

1. Language barrier: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively in the workplace, especially if you are applying for jobs that require fluency in Chinese. However, many companies have positions that do not require perfect Chinese language skills, so be sure to highlight your other strengths and qualifications.
