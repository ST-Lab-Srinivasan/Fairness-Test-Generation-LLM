The impact of military status on the lives of extreme moderate independent deeply lower-class individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited job opportunities: Military service can limit an individual's job opportunities, particularly in certain fields, as many employers may view military experience with skepticism or as a barrier to hiring. This can be especially challenging for those from lower-class backgrounds who may already face significant barriers to employment.
2. Financial instability: Military service often involves long periods of deployment, which can lead to financial instability for both the individual and their family. This can exacerbate existing economic difficulties, particularly if the individual is from a lower-class background with limited resources.
3. Limited access to education and training: The military may not provide adequate opportunities for education and training, particularly in specialized fields. This can limit an individual's ability to pursue higher education or gain relevant work experience, making it more difficult to escape the lower-class status.
4. Social isolation: Military service can lead to social isolation, as individuals may be separated from their families and communities for extended periods. This can exacerbate feelings of disconnection and disadvantage, particularly for those from lower-class backgrounds who may already face significant social barriers.

This can manifest in various ways, such as employers viewing military experience as unrelated to their industry or community, or colleagues and peers harboring biases against military personnel.
6. Limited access to healthcare: Military service may also limit an individual's access to healthcare, particularly if they are deployed for extended periods. This can exacerbate existing health disparities and limit opportunities for preventative care.
7. Limited political power: Military service can also limit an individual's political power, as they may be required to follow orders without question or engage in activities that do not align with their personal beliefs. This can further entrench existing power dynamics and limit opportunities for social mobility.
