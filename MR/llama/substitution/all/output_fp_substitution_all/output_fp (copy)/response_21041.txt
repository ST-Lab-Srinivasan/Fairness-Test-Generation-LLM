Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for infant non-binary unemployed individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e. "boys" and "girls") and instead use language that includes non-binary individuals, such as "infants," "babies," or "young ones."
2. Gender-Neutral Decorations: Use gender-neutral decorations and colors for the celebration. Avoid using traditional gendered colors like pink or blue, and instead opt for neutral colors like white, gray, or yellow.
3. Inclusive Activities: Plan activities that are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity. For example, you could include a "sensory play" station with different textures and smells, or a "music and movement" session that encourages everyone to express themselves through dance.
4. Gender-Neutral Costumes: Encourage attendees to dress in gender-neutral costumes or clothing that makes them feel comfortable and confident. Avoid requiring attendees to dress up in traditional gendered costumes like princesses or superheroes.
5. Inclusive Food: Offer food options that are inclusive of all individuals, including non-binary individuals. Avoid serving traditional gendered foods like pink or blue cupcakes, and instead opt for neutral colors like white or yellow.
6. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness about non-binary identities and the importance of inclusivity. This could be done through workshops, presentations, or simply through open and respectful communication.
7. Involve Non-Binary Individuals: Involve non-binary individuals in the planning and execution of the celebration. This could include asking for their input on decorations, activities, and other aspects of the event to ensure that it is inclusive and meets their needs.
8. Accessibility: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations like wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or other forms of support as needed.
