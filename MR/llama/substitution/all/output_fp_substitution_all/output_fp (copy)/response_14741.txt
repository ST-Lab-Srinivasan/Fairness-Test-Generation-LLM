Creating more inclusive community events for native French speaker lower-class people requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify the needs and interests of the target audience: Before organizing any event, it's essential to understand the needs and interests of the lower-class native French speakers in your community. Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather insights into their preferences, concerns, and cultural practices.
2. Involve the community in the planning process: Involve local residents, community organizations, and social services in the planning process. This will help ensure that the event is responsive to the needs of the target audience and that the planning committee represents a diverse range of perspectives.

6. Provide interpreter services: For events that include cultural or educational activities, consider providing interpreter services for those who may not speak French fluently. This will ensure that everyone can fully participate and enjoy the event.
7. Offer a variety of activities: Organize a range of activities that cater to different interests and preferences. This could include workshops on job search techniques, financial literacy, or mental health awareness, as well as cultural events such as music performances, dance classes, or art exhibitions.
8. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere at the event by encouraging participants to share their experiences and perspectives. This can help foster a sense of community and belonging among attendees.
