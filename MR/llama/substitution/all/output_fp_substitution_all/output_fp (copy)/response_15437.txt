The term "long-term unemployed ultra-liberal" is quite broad and encompasses a wide range of individuals with varying experiences, beliefs, and values. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to support the social inclusion of this group:

1. Listen actively: Encourage them to share their stories, opinions, and experiences without judgment. Listening actively shows that you value their perspectives and are willing to learn from them.
2. Avoid stereotypes: Refrain from making assumptions about the long-term unemployed based on preconceived notions or stereotypes. Instead, get to know them as individuals and learn about their unique experiences and challenges.
3. Offer supportive resources: Provide access to resources that can help them improve their job prospects, such as career counseling, job training programs, or networking events.
4. Advocate for policies that promote social inclusion: Support policies that address the root causes of unemployment and promote inclusive economic growth, such as progressive taxation, affordable healthcare, and investments in education and job training.
5. Promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace: Encourage companies to adopt diversity and inclusion initiatives that create a welcoming environment for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.
6. Foster a culture of empathy: Encourage open communication, active listening, and mutual respect among colleagues and peers. This can help create a more supportive work environment and promote social inclusion.
7. Provide mentorship opportunities: Pair the long-term unemployed with experienced professionals who can offer guidance, advice, and support in navigating the job market.
8. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent the long-term unemployed from finding stable employment, such as discrimination, lack of access to education or training, or limited job opportunities in their area.
9. Encourage self-care: Support the long-term unemployed in practicing self-care and managing stress, which can be particularly challenging for those who have been out of work for an extended period.
10. Celebrate successes
