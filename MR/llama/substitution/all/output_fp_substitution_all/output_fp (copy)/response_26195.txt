4. Collaboration with tribal organizations: Work with local Native American tribes and organizations to provide cultural and academic support services specifically tailored to the needs of visually impaired individuals in these communities.
5. Bilingual education: Offer bilingual education programs that incorporate both English and a Native language to help students maintain their cultural identity while also receiving a quality education.
6. Traditional knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and practices into the curriculum to provide a more inclusive and culturally responsive learning environment.
7. Community-based learning: Involve visually impaired students in community-based learning activities, such as participating in cultural events or volunteering in their communities, to help them develop social skills and a sense of belonging.
8. Mental health support: Provide mental health services specifically tailored to the needs of visually impaired individuals, including counseling and therapy sessions.
9. Peer support: Establish peer support groups for visually impaired students to provide emotional support and a sense of community.
