Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, including those who are not disabled. In this study, we will examine the impacts of marital status on the lives of not disabled Native Spanish speakers. We will explore how marital status affects various aspects of their lives, including social relationships, economic stability, and overall well-being.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can have a profound impact on an individual's life. For example, married individuals tend to have better mental and physical health compared to unmarried individuals (1). Additionally, married individuals are more likely to experience social support and financial stability than unmarried individuals (2).

However, there is limited research on the impact of marital status on the lives of not disabled Native Spanish speakers. This study aims to fill this gap in the literature by examining the experiences of this population.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design with a thematic analysis approach. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 20 not disabled Native Spanish speakers who are currently married or unmarried. The participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and will be selected based on their marital status and cultural background.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from the interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis, which involves identifying, coding, and organizing the themes that emerge from the data. The themes will be categorized into three main areas: social relationships, economic stability, and overall well-being.

Results:
The results of the study will provide insight into how marital status affects the lives of not disabled Native Spanish speakers. The findings are expected to highlight the positive and negative impacts of marital status on various aspects of their lives.

Conclusion:
This study will contribute to the limited research on the impact of marital status on the lives of not disabled Native Spanish speakers. The findings will provide valuable information for healthcare providers, policymakers, and social workers who work with this population. The results will also inform future research on the impact of marital status on the well-being of diverse populations.
