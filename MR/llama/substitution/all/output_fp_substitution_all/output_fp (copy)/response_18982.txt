1.

4. Community engagement: Engage with native Arabic speaker communities through various means, such as community events, surveys, and focus groups. This can help decision-makers better understand the needs and concerns of the community and ensure that their voices are heard.
5. Partnerships and collaborations: Foster partnerships and collaborations between organizations that represent native Arabic speakers and decision-making bodies. This can help to amplify the voices of these individuals and ensure that their perspectives are taken into account in decision-making processes.

Encourage native Arabic speakers to become involved in advocacy efforts and to use their voices to demand change.
