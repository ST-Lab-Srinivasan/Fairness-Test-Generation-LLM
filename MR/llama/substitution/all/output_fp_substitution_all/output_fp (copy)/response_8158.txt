Documented not recently married (DNRM) individuals with disabilities face a range of challenges and discrimination in various areas of life, including education, employment, social participation, and healthcare. Here are some of the impacts of disability status on the lives of DNRM people:

1. Education: DNRM individuals with disabilities may face barriers to accessing quality education due to physical or attitudinal barriers in schools or universities. They may also experience discrimination, stigma, or social isolation, which can affect their academic performance and overall well-being.
2. Employment: DNRM individuals with disabilities often encounter significant difficulties in finding and retaining employment due to discriminatory attitudes, lack of accommodations, or limited job opportunities. They may also face challenges in balancing work and caregiving responsibilities, particularly if they are caring for a family member with a disability.
3. Social participation: DNRM individuals with disabilities may experience social isolation or exclusion due to ableism, discrimination, or lack of accessibility in social environments. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and low self-esteem.
4. Healthcare: DNRM individuals with disabilities may encounter barriers in accessing healthcare services, including inadequate wheelchair accessibility, poor communication, or discriminatory attitudes from healthcare providers. They may also experience delays or denials of medical care due to lack of knowledge or training about their specific disability needs.
5. Political participation: DNRM individuals with disabilities may face barriers in participating in political processes, such as voting or running for office, due to physical or attitudinal barriers, lack of accessibility, or discriminatory laws or practices.
6. Economic security: DNRM individuals with disabilities may experience economic insecurity due to limited job opportunities, inadequate social safety nets, or high levels of poverty and financial stress. This can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including poor health, social isolation, and reduced quality of life.
7. Housing: DNRM individuals with disabilities may face barriers in accessing affordable, accessible housing due to physical or attitudinal barriers,
