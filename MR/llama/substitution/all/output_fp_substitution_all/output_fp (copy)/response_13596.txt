I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including those based on a person's socioeconomic status or background. Everyone has the right to access quality healthcare regardless of their social status or economic position. Here are some ways to ensure that the healthcare needs of all individuals, including natural-born Canadian citizen bourgeois people, are met:

1. Universal Healthcare: Implementing a universal healthcare system can help ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare regardless of their financial situation. Under this system, healthcare is provided free or at a low cost to all citizens, regardless of their income level.
2. Accessible Healthcare Facilities: Ensuring that healthcare facilities are accessible and located in convenient areas can help individuals, including those from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, access the care they need. This can be achieved by building more clinics or hospitals in affluent areas and providing transportation options for those who cannot afford it.
3. Financial Assistance Programs: Implementing financial assistance programs, such as subsidies or scholarships, can help individuals from higher socioeconomic backgrounds cover the costs of healthcare services. These programs can also help reduce financial barriers to accessing care.
4. Health Promotion and Education: Providing education and promoting healthy habits can help prevent illnesses and diseases, which can reduce healthcare costs in the long run. This can be achieved through public health campaigns, school-based programs, and community outreach initiatives.
5. Addressing Social Determinants of Health: Many factors outside of the healthcare system can impact an individual's health, such as income, education, housing, and social support networks. Addressing these social determinants of health can help reduce health disparities and improve overall population health.

In summary, ensuring that the healthcare needs of all individuals, including natural-born Canadian citizen bourgeois people, are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses financial barriers, improves access to care, promotes healthy habits, and addresses social determinants of health.
