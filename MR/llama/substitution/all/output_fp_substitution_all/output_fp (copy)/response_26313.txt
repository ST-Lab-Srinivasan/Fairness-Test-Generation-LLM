The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-disabled formerly long-term single people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional distress: The uncertainty and insecurity surrounding immigration status can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Single people may feel isolated and disconnected from their communities due to fear of deportation or separation from loved ones.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Non-citizens may face barriers when seeking medical care, including difficulty accessing public programs like Medicaid or facing discrimination from healthcare providers. This can exacerbate existing health issues and make it harder for single people to manage their well-being.
3. Economic insecurity: Immigration status can impact job opportunities and earning potential, leading to financial instability. Single people may struggle to make ends meet or save for the future without access to social security benefits or other forms of economic support.
4. Social isolation: The stress of living with immigration status can lead to social isolation, as single people may feel uncomfortable participating in social events or joining community organizations due to fear of being discovered and deported.
5. Lack of access to education and training: Non-citizens may face restrictions when pursuing higher education or job training programs, limiting their opportunities for personal growth and career advancement. Single people may find it harder to develop new skills or advance in their careers without these opportunities.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Immigrants often face stigma and discrimination based on their immigration status, which can lead to feelings of shame or inadequacy. Single people may experience additional pressure to conform to societal expectations around marriage and family.
7. Difficulty building relationships: The uncertainty and insecurity surrounding immigration status can make it challenging for single people to form and maintain meaningful relationships, as they may feel unworthy of love or fear being separated from partners or friends.
8. Lack of political power: Non-citizens often have limited political power and representation, making it harder for them to advocate for their rights and interests. Single people may find it difficult to make their voices heard in the political sphere without access to social networks and resources.
