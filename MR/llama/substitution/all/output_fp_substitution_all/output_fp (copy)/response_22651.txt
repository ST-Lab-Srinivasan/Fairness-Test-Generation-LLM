Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Arabic speakers who are long-term unemployed requires understanding their needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or provide interpreters/translators during the event to help non-Arabic speakers communicate effectively. This will enable long-term unemployed individuals to participate without feeling intimidated or excluded due to their language barriers.
2. Focus on practical skills: Long-term unemployment can lead to a lack of relevant skills, making it difficult for individuals to find jobs.
