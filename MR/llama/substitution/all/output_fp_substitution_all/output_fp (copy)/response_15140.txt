As an AI language model, I do not have access to personal information or specific details about individuals. However, I can provide some general information on the challenges that older adults (defined as those aged 65 and above) may face in the legal system. These challenges can be particularly pronounced for mixed Asian heritage individuals who may experience additional barriers due to their cultural background or identity.

1. Limited access to legal resources: Older adults may have limited access to legal resources such as legal aid services, pro bono lawyers, or other forms of support. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for themselves.
