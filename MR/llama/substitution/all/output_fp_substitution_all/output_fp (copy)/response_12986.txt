Title: Exploring the Intersectionality of Cultural Heritage and Identity among Mixed African American Devout Practicing Hindus

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially those from mixed racial and ethnic backgrounds. In the context of mixed African American devout practicing Hindus, cultural heritage can influence their spiritual beliefs, religious practices, and overall identity. This study aims to explore the intersectionality of cultural heritage and identity among this particular group.

 Literature Review:
Studies have shown that cultural heritage can affect an individual's identity formation in various ways. For instance, research on second-generation immigrants has revealed that their cultural heritage influences how they navigate between their ethnic and national identities (Hwang & Tucker, 2013). Similarly, studies on mixed-race individuals have highlighted the complex interplay between racial and ethnic identities and the role of cultural heritage in shaping these identities (Lum, 2015).

In the context of Hinduism, cultural heritage can also play a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed African American devout practicing Hindus. For instance, some may adopt Hindu practices and beliefs as a way to connect with their African American heritage (Kothari, 2017). Others may use Hinduism as a means to challenge dominant cultural narratives and construct their own identities (Chakravarty, 2013).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with mixed African American devout practicing Hindus. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and social media outreach. The interview questions will explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping their identities, including how they navigate between different racial and ethnic identities, and how they incorporate Hindu practices and beliefs into their daily lives.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between cultural heritage and identity among mixed African American devout practicing Hindus. By exploring the ways in which cultural heritage shapes their identities, this study can provide ins
