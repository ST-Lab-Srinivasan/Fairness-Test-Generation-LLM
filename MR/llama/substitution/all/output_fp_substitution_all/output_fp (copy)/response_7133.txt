Creating more inclusive social policies for lower-class early-transition bisexual individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers faced by this community. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge the Intersectionality of Identity: Early-transition bisexual individuals often face intersecting forms of discrimination based on their race, gender, class, and other identity factors. Policies should recognize and address these intersections to ensure inclusivity and equity.
2. Increase Access to Healthcare: Lower-class early-transition bisexual individuals may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to financial constraints or lack of knowledge about available resources. Policies can aim to increase access to affordable and culturally competent healthcare services, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and gender-affirming surgeries.
3. Provide Financial Support: Many lower-class early-transition bisexual individuals struggle with financial instability due to systemic inequality. Policies can offer financial assistance programs, such as scholarships or grants, to help cover the costs of HRT and other gender-affirming measures.
4. Address Employment Discrimination: Early-transition bisexual individuals may experience discrimination in the workplace due to their gender identity. Policies can aim to protect workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and provide support for those who face such discrimination.
5. Build Community Support: Lower-class early-transition bisexual individuals often lack access to social support networks. Policies can encourage the creation of community spaces and support groups specifically tailored to this demographic, providing a safe and inclusive environment for connection and mutual aid.
6. Advocate for Inclusive Education: Educational institutions must provide comprehensive sex education that includes LGBTQ+ issues, especially in lower-income communities where access to resources may be limited. This can help early-transition bisexual youth navigate their identities and access necessary support.
7. Promote Cultural Competency Training: Providing cultural competency training for healthcare professionals, educators, and other service providers can help ensure that lower-class early-transition bisexual individuals receive respectful and affirming care.
