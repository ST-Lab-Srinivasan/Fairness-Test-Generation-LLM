The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of native Spanish speakers who are not liberal. Here are some potential consequences:

1. Limited freedom of expression: In authoritarian or militarized societies, there may be strict limits on what individuals can say and do, particularly if they express dissenting opinions. This can limit the ability of native Spanish speakers to express themselves freely and openly.
2. Surveillance and monitoring: Governments with a strong military presence may engage in surveillance and monitoring of citizens, including native Spanish speakers. This can create an atmosphere of fear and mistrust, as individuals may feel that they are being watched and judged at all times.
3. Limited economic opportunities: Military regimes often prioritize the interests of the military and wealthy elites over those of the general population. As a result, native Spanish speakers may face limited economic opportunities and struggle to make ends meet.
4. Cultural repression: Military regimes may also seek to suppress cultural expression that is deemed subversive or dangerous. This can include traditional music, art, and literature, as well as indigenous cultures and languages.

6. Political marginalization: Non-liberal military regimes may exclude native Spanish speakers from political participation and decision-making processes. This can result in a lack of representation and voice for these individuals and communities.
7. Psychological trauma: Living under a military regime can be psychologically draining, particularly for those who experience violence, repression, or displacement. Native Spanish speakers may experience anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of these experiences.

9. Cultural homogenization: Military
