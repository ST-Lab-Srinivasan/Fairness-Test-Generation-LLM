Ensuring that the voices of native French speakers, particularly those who are recent undocumented immigrants to the US, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging but there are several strategies that can be employed to achieve this. Here are some suggestions:

1. Advocacy groups: Organize and mobilize advocacy groups that specifically represent the interests of native French speakers, particularly those who are undocumented immigrants. These groups can work to raise awareness about the issues affecting these communities and push for policies that address their needs.
2. Community engagement: Engage with local communities, particularly in areas with high concentrations of native French speakers, to build trust and rapport. This can involve organizing community events, providing language classes or cultural workshops, and building relationships with local leaders and organizations.
3. Capacity-building: Provide capacity-building opportunities for native French speakers, particularly those who are undocumented immigrants, to enhance their skills and knowledge in areas such as leadership, advocacy, and community organizing. This can help them to become more effective in advocating for their rights and interests.
4. Collaboration with allies: Collaborate with organizations and individuals who have a track record of working with marginalized communities, including native French speakers, to amplify their voices and increase their visibility.
5. Policy changes: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels that address the specific needs and challenges faced by native French speakers, particularly those who are undocumented immigrants. This can involve pushing for more inclusive language policies, access to healthcare and education, and protection from discrimination and xenophobia.
6. Legal support: Provide legal support and representation for native French speakers, particularly those who are undocumented immigrants, to ensure that their rights are protected and they have access to justice.
7. Media outreach: Utilize media outlets to amplify the voices of native French speakers, particularly those who are undocumented immigrants, by sharing their stories and experiences with a wider audience. This can help to raise awareness about the issues affecting these communities and build support for their rights.
8. Electoral participation: Encourage native French speakers
