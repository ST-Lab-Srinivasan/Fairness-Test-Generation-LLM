I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to support or promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs or practices, including those that are extreme or ultra-conservative. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own identity and expression, but it is also important to respect the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support and promote inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their cultural or social identity. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Listen and learn from others: Take the time to listen to and learn from the experiences and perspectives of individuals from diverse backgrounds. This can help you better understand their needs and concerns, and find common ground.
2. Challenge your own biases and assumptions: Recognize that we all have biases and assumptions that are shaped by our upbringing and experiences. Challenge your own biases and assumptions, and be open to learning and growing.
3. Advocate for inclusive policies and practices: Work towards creating an environment that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion.
4. Support marginalized communities: Use your privilege and resources to support marginalized communities, such as by donating to organizations that work towards social justice and equality.
5. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to educate yourself on the experiences and challenges faced by marginalized communities. Share this knowledge with others, and work together to create a more inclusive and respectful environment.

Remember, promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals is an ongoing process that requires effort and dedication. By working together, we can create a more just and equitable society for everyone.
