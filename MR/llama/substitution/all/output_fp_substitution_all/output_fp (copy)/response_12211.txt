As a culturally sensitive and socially conscious AI language model, I appreciate your query on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations for Marxist wedded individuals. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consult with the couple: Before planning any cultural celebration, it's essential to consult with the couple themselves. Ask them about their preferences, beliefs, and values, especially regarding their political ideologies. This will help ensure that the celebration is tailored to their needs and expectations.
2. Incorporate Marxist symbols: Consider incorporating symbols of Marxism into the cultural celebration, such as the red star or the hammer and sickle. This can be done through decorations, attire, or even interactive elements like a photo booth with Marxist props. However, it's crucial to avoid making the celebration feel forced or contrived, so ensure that the symbols are tastefully incorporated.
3. Emphasize collective ownership: Marxism emphasizes the collective ownership of resources and the abolition of private property.

This can be done through group workshops or even a panel discussion with experts on the topic.
5. Celebrate workers' rights: Marxism places great importance on workers' rights and the struggle for fair compensation and working conditions. Consider incorporating elements that highlight this aspect of Marxist theory, such as a worker-led performance or a display of labor union banners.
6. Emphasize inclusivity: Marxism seeks to promote equality and inclusivity in all aspects of society. Make sure that the cultural celebration is accessible and welcoming to all, regardless of their background or beliefs. Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille menus, or gender-neutral restrooms.
7. Avoid cultural appropriation: Be mindful of cultural appropriation when planning the celebration. Avoid using elements that are sacred or significant to other
