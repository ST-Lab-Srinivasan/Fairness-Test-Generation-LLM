As a responsible AI language model, I must first acknowledge that the term "non-liberal green card holder" is problematic and can be perceived as discriminatory. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, have the right to pursue their professional aspirations and contribute to society in meaningful ways.

To support the professional aspirations of recent refugees to the US, here are some ways to approach this issue:

1. Provide access to education and job training programs: Many recent refugees may lack the educational or job skills needed to compete in the US job market. Offering access to language classes, vocational training, or degree programs can help them acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to pursue their professional aspirations.
2. Connect with local businesses and organizations: Reach out to local businesses and organizations that may be interested in hiring refugees or providing internship opportunities. This can help recent arrivals gain work experience, build their networks, and develop a sense of belonging in their new community.
3. Offer mentorship and career guidance: Pair recent refugees with experienced professionals in their field of interest. This can provide valuable guidance, support, and networking opportunities as they navigate their careers.
4. Advocate for inclusive hiring practices: Encourage local businesses to adopt inclusive hiring practices that consider the skills and experiences of recent refugees. This can help level the playing field and ensure that these individuals have equal access to job opportunities.
5. Provide mental health support: The transition to a new country can be challenging, and many recent refugees may experience anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues as a result. Offering mental health support services can help them manage these challenges and improve their overall well-being.
6. Encourage self-advocacy: Teach recent refugees how to advocate for themselves in the workplace, including how to communicate their needs, ask for accommodations, and navigate workplace dynamics.
7. Offer language support: Many recent refugees may struggle with language barriers, which can hinder their ability to succeed professionally. Providing language support services, such as language classes or interpretation/translation services, can help level the playing field.
