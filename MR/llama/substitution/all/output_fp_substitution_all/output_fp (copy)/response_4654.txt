Ensuring that the healthcare needs of low-income people in Mexico are met is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this challenge:

1. Increase access to affordable healthcare: One of the main barriers to accessing healthcare for low-income individuals in Mexico is the cost. Increasing the availability of affordable healthcare options, such as community clinics or subsidized private clinics, could help to address this issue.
2. Implement a universal healthcare system: A universal healthcare system would provide access to healthcare for all individuals, regardless of their income level. This could be achieved through a combination of public and private providers, with a focus on primary care and preventive services.
3. Strengthen the public healthcare system: Mexico's public healthcare system is already well-established, but it could be strengthened by increasing funding for hospitals and clinics, improving staff training and resources, and streamlining administrative processes to reduce wait times and improve patient flow.
4. Promote preventive care: Many low-income individuals in Mexico do not have access to regular healthchecks or preventive care services. Promoting the importance of preventive care could help to identify health issues early on and reduce the burden on the healthcare system in the long term.
5.

Addressing these social determinants of health could help to improve overall health outcomes and reduce health disparities.
6. Engage communities in healthcare decision-making: Community engagement and participation in healthcare decision-making can help to ensure that the needs and preferences of low-income individuals are taken into account when designing and delivering healthcare services.
7. Provide financial support for healthcare: Low-income individuals may struggle to pay for healthcare services, even if they have access to them. Providing financial support, such as subsidies or sliding scale fees, could help to make healthcare more affordable and accessible.
8. Foster collaboration between providers: Collaboration between health
