Older adult permanent residents in their 20s may face a range of challenges in the job market, including:

1. Ageism: Unfortunately, ageism is still prevalent in many workplaces, and older workers may be overlooked for promotions or opportunities due to their age.
2. Lack of relevant experience: If an older adult has been out of the job market for a significant period of time, they may struggle to find employers who are willing to give them a chance based on their age alone.
3. Limited career advancement opportunities: Many older workers may feel that they have limited opportunities for career advancement, as they may be seen as being "too old" or "past their prime" in the eyes of employers.
4. Difficulty adapting to new technologies: With the rapid pace of technological change, it can be challenging for older workers to keep up with the latest tools and software, which can limit their job prospects.
5. Health issues: Older adults may face a range of health issues as they age, such as decreased mobility or cognitive decline, which can make it difficult to perform certain job tasks.
6. Caregiving responsibilities: Many older adults may have caregiving responsibilities for elderly parents or other family members, which can limit their ability to work full-time or pursue certain job opportunities.
7. Limited job prospects in certain industries: Some industries may be less likely to hire older workers due to the physical demands of the job or the perceived lack of energy or enthusiasm that comes with age.
8. Stereotypes and bias: Unfortunately, there are still many stereotypes and biases against older adults in the workplace, which can limit their opportunities for advancement or lead to discrimination.
9. Limited access to training and education: Older workers may face barriers to accessing training and education programs, which can limit their ability to develop new skills and stay competitive in the job market.
