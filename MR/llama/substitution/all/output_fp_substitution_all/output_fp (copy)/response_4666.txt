As a recent Green Card holder in the US, you may face several challenges when accessing healthcare as a non-citizen. Here are some of the common obstacles:

1. Lack of coverage: As a temporary visa holder or recently naturalized citizen, you may not be eligible for Medicaid or other government-funded health insurance programs. This can leave you without adequate healthcare coverage, especially if you don't have access to an employer-based plan or can't afford private insurance.
2. Language barriers: Depending on your native language and the location where you reside, communication with healthcare providers may be challenging. You may struggle to understand medical terminology, fill out forms, or communicate your concerns to healthcare professionals.
3. Limited access to care: Depending on where you live in the US, you may encounter difficulties accessing healthcare services due to geographic barriers, transportation limitations, or a lack of providers who speak your native language.
4. Costly care: Even if you have health insurance, you may face high out-of-pocket costs for medical services, particularly if you don't have coverage for prescription medications, dental care, or other essential healthcare services.
5. Immigration status concerns: As a non-citizen, you may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of immigration status consequences. You may worry that seeking medical attention could lead to deportation or other negative immigration outcomes.
6. Limited cultural competency: Some healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural practices and beliefs of non-English speaking patients, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
7. Lack of patient advocacy: As a temporary visa holder or recently naturalized citizen, you may feel less empowered to advocate for yourself in the healthcare system due to your immigration status. You may be hesitant to ask questions or seek additional services out of fear of being perceived as "difficult" or "uncooperative."
8. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on your medical needs, you may encounter difficulties accessing specialized care, such as oncology, cardiology, or neurology services, particularly if these services are not available
