I cannot provide advice on how to manipulate or coerce individuals into participating in political activities, including voting. It is important to respect the rights and autonomy of all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or immigration status. Encouraging civic engagement and political participation must be done in a peaceful and lawful manner, without infringing on the rights of others.

Instead, here are some ways to support the civic engagement of recent temporary visa holders to the US:

1. Provide accurate and unbiased information: Offer resources and information that help them understand the voting process, candidates, and issues. This can be done through non-partisan voter guides, fact sheets, or online resources.
2. Encourage registration: Help eligible recent temporary visa holders to register to vote by providing information on voter registration deadlines, locations, and requirements.
3. Offer language support: Provide interpretation and translation services during voting events or town halls to ensure that everyone can fully participate.
4. Facilitate transportation: Arrange for transportation to polling stations or voting events to ensure that they can easily cast their ballots.
5. Create a welcoming environment: Host cultural events or activities that promote civic engagement and encourage participation in the democratic process.
6. Build bridges: Connect recent temporary visa holders with local organizations, community groups, or elected officials to foster relationships and build trust.
7. Provide childcare: Offer childcare services during voting events or town halls to ensure that parents can fully participate in the democratic process without worrying about their children's care.
8. Address barriers: Identify and address any legal, social, or cultural barriers that may prevent recent temporary visa holders from exercising their right to vote.
9. Lead by example: Engage in civic activities yourself and encourage others to do the same. By setting a good example, you can inspire others to participate in the democratic process.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diverse backgrounds and experiences of recent temporary visa holders and promote their contributions to the community. This can help create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone.
