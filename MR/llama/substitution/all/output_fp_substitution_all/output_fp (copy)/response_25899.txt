The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of left-leaning average earners, including:

1. Income inequality: The military-industrial complex can perpetuate income inequality by funneling resources and opportunities towards those who are already wealthy and powerful, while leaving others behind. This can result in a widening gap between the rich and the poor, with left-leaning average earners feeling left behind and marginalized.
2. Limited access to education and job opportunities: The military may prioritize the hiring of those who have received military training or have connections within the military network, making it more difficult for left-leaning average earners to access education and job opportunities. This can perpetuate a cycle of inequality and limit the potential of those from less privileged backgrounds.
3. Lack of representation in decision-making processes: The military may be dominated by those who hold power and influence, leaving little room for left-leaning average earners to have their voices heard or to participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives. This can result in policies that do not serve the needs and interests of all citizens, particularly those from marginalized communities.
4. Surveillance and control: The military may use surveillance and control measures to maintain order and suppress dissent, which can be particularly challenging for left-leaning average earners who may be more likely to challenge the status quo or speak out against injustices. This can result in a culture of fear and mistrust, where individuals are reluctant to express their opinions or participate in political activities.
5. Gender and sexuality-based discrimination: The military may perpetuate gender and sexuality-based discrimination, limiting the opportunities and rights of left-leaning average earners who do not conform to traditional gender or sexuality norms. This can result in a lack of representation and marginalization of already vulnerable communities.
6. Limited access to healthcare: The military may prioritize the healthcare needs of those who are serving in the military, leaving left-leaning average earners with limited access to healthcare resources. This can result in a lack of access to necessary medical care, particularly for those with pre-existing conditions or chronic illnesses.
