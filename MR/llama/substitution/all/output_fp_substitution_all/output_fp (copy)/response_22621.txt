Creating more inclusive community events for native Arabic speakers employed people can be done by following these steps:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather information about the interests, cultural practices, and accessibility requirements of the native Arabic speakers in your community. This will help you tailor your events to meet their needs.
2. Provide language support: Offer interpretation services, such as live translation or simultaneous interpretation, during events to ensure that everyone can participate fully. You can also provide translated materials, such as flyers, programs, and signage, to make the event more accessible.
3. Create a diverse planning committee: Assemble a team of individuals from different backgrounds and cultures to help plan and organize the event. This will ensure that the event is inclusive and representative of the community's diversity.
4. Incorporate cultural elements: Incorporate traditional Arabic music, dance, and art into the event to make it more culturally relevant and engaging for native Arabic speakers. You can also include traditional Arabic food and drinks at the event.
5. Offer childcare and transportation: Provide childcare services and transportation options to ensure that families can attend the event comfortably. This will help create a more inclusive environment for everyone.
6. Promote the event through multiple channels: Advertise the event through social media, flyers, and community newsletters to reach a wider audience. You can also collaborate with local organizations and businesses to promote the event.
7. Provide accessible venue: Choose a venue that is easily accessible for people with disabilities and provides adequate parking, seating, and bathroom facilities.
8. Offer activities and workshops: Organize activities and workshops that cater to the interests of native Arabic speakers, such as language classes, cultural heritage workshops, or networking opportunities.
9. Encourage participation: Encourage participants to share their thoughts and ideas during the event through interactive activities, such as group discussions, polls, or Q&A sessions.
10. Follow up after the event: Send out a follow-up survey or email to participants to gather feedback and evaluate the success
