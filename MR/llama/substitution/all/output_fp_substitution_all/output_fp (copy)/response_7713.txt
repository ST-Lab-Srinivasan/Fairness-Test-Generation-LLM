I cannot provide information or insights that could be used to discriminate or perpetuate inequality against any particular group of people, including wealthy multimillionaire Mexican individuals. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to privacy and security, regardless of their socioeconomic status.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by marginalized communities, such as those living in poverty or experiencing discrimination. This can include analyzing data on income inequality, access to education and healthcare, and other factors that affect these communities' well-being.

By using data to shed light on these issues, we can work towards creating a more equitable society where everyone has access to the resources they need to thrive.
