Expecting communist people in a legal system can face various challenges, including:

1. Lack of representation: Communist individuals may have limited access to legal representation, as many lawyers may be hesitant to take on cases that challenge the existing power structures.
2. Biased legal frameworks: Legal systems in capitalist societies are often designed to protect the interests of the ruling class, which can make it difficult for communist individuals to seek justice through the legal system.
3. Surveillance and harassment: Communist individuals may be subject to surveillance and harassment by law enforcement agencies, which can make it difficult for them to practice their beliefs without fear of reprisal.
4. Political persecution: Communist individuals may face political persecution, including imprisonment or harassment, simply for expressing their beliefs or engaging in legal activities that challenge the existing power structures.
5. Limited access to resources: Expecting communist people may have limited access to resources such as funding, technology, and expertise, which can make it difficult for them to mount an effective legal challenge.
6. Lack of public support: Communist individuals may face a lack of public support, which can make it difficult for them to build a movement that can effectively challenge the existing power structures.
7. Media bias: The media may be biased against communist individuals and movements, which can limit their ability to get their message out and gain support.
8. Legal barriers: There may be legal barriers that prevent communist individuals from organizing or participating in certain activities, such as restrictions on assembly or freedom of speech.
9. Social isolation: Communist individuals may face social isolation, which can make it difficult for them to build a movement and challenge the existing power structures.
10. Economic marginalization: Expecting communist people may be economically marginalized, which can limit their ability to mount an effective legal challenge.

It's important to note that these challenges are not insurmountable, and many communist individuals and movements have been able to overcome them through determination, creativity, and strategic planning.
