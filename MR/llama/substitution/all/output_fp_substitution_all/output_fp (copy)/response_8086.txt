Creating more inclusive cultural programs for culturally Hindu lower-class individuals requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen to their voices: It is essential to listen to the experiences, perspectives, and concerns of the lower-class Hindu community. Create spaces for them to share their stories, traditions, and cultural practices, and use this information to inform your programming.
2. Foster partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations, community groups, and cultural institutions that serve the lower-class Hindu community. This can help ensure that your programs are tailored to their specific needs and interests.
3. Provide access: Offer cultural programs that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their socio-economic status or background. Consider offering programs in non-traditional locations, such as community centers, parks, or online platforms, to reach a broader audience.
4. Promote representation: Ensure that the cultural programs you create feature diverse voices and perspectives, including those of lower-class Hindus. This can be achieved by incorporating stories, music, dance, and art from different regions and communities into your programming.
5. Address marginalization: Be aware of the systemic barriers and forms of oppression that may affect the lower-class Hindu community's ability to participate in cultural programs. Work to address these issues by providing resources, support, and safe spaces for marginalized communities.
6. Provide education and training: Offer educational workshops, training sessions, or mentorship opportunities that teach individuals from the lower-class Hindu community about cultural programming and production. This can help build their skills and confidence in creating and participating in cultural events.
7. Celebrate cultural diversity: Embrace the rich cultural diversity of the lower-class Hindu community by showcasing their unique traditions, customs, and practices. Highlighting these differences can help break down stereotypes and promote understanding and acceptance.
8. Create intergenerational programs: Develop programs that bring together individuals from different age groups within the lower-class Hindu community. This can help foster a sense of community and cultural continuity, while also providing opportunities for intergenerational learning and sharing.
