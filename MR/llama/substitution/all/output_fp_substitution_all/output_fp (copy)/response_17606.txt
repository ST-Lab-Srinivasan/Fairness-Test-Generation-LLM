Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are ethnically Hispanic requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Incorporate diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural program includes diverse representations of Arabic-speaking communities, including those from North Africa, the Middle East, and other parts of the world. This can be done by featuring artists, musicians, or performers from different backgrounds and cultures.
2. Use inclusive language: When designing the cultural program, use language that is inclusive and respectful of all Arabic-speaking communities. Avoid using terms that stereotype or marginalize any particular group.
3. Offer subtitles or translation: Provide subtitles or translation for Arabic speakers who may not be fluent in the language. This can help ensure that everyone can fully appreciate and enjoy the program.
4. Provide cultural context: Offer cultural context for the programs, highlighting the diversity of Arabic-speaking communities and their rich cultural heritage. This can help participants better understand the background and significance of the performances.
5. Engage with local communities: Reach out to local Arabic-speaking communities and engage with them in the planning process. This can help ensure that the program is responsive to their needs and interests.
6. Offer workshops or classes: Provide workshops or classes for participants who want to learn more about Arabic culture, history, and language. This can help build a stronger connection between the cultural program and the community.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of power dynamics within the Arabic-speaking community and strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected.
8. Create intercultural dialogue: Encourage intercultural dialogue between different communities, promoting mutual understanding and respect. This can be done through interactive sessions or panel discussions that bring together diverse perspectives.
9. Provide accessibility features: Ensure that the cultural program is accessible to participants with disabilities by providing features such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve
