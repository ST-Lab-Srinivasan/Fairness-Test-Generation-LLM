1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds. By understanding the cultural nuances of language and nonverbal cues, providers can build trust and rapport with their patients, leading to better health outcomes.
2. Avoid cultural mistakes: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent are less likely to make mistakes that could be offensive or harmful to their patients. For example, they may avoid using medical equipment or procedures that are prohibited in certain cultures.
