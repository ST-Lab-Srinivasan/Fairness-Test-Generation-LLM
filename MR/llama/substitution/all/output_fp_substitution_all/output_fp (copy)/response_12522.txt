To ensure that the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those who are not long-time divorced individuals, are heard in decision-making processes, here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or resources to help beginners improve their French skills, which can help them participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
2. Create inclusive spaces: Design spaces and events where beginners feel comfortable and included, allowing them to share their thoughts and opinions without feeling marginalized.
3. Use clear communication channels: Establish clear and accessible communication channels for decision-making processes, such as translators or interpreters, to ensure that all voices are heard.
4. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusivity within the organization, where diverse perspectives are valued and respected.
5. Provide opportunities for participation: Offer opportunities for beginners to participate in decision-making processes, such as through mentorship programs or volunteer work.
6. Address power imbalances: Acknowledge any power imbalances that may exist within the organization and take steps to address them, such as by providing additional support or resources to marginalized groups.
7. Use participatory methods: Utilize participatory methods, such as co-design or co-facilitation, to involve beginners in decision-making processes and ensure their voices are heard.
8. Build trust: Develop trust among the organization's members by being transparent, consistent, and reliable in your interactions with them.
9. Provide feedback mechanisms: Establish mechanisms for beginners to provide feedback on decision-making processes and ensure that their concerns are addressed in a timely manner.
10. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diversity of perspectives and experiences within the organization, and create opportunities for beginners to share their thoughts and opinions.

By implementing these strategies, organizations can better ensure that the voices of beginner French speakers are heard in decision-making processes, and that all members feel included and valued.
