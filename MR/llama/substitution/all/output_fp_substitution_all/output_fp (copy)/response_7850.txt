As a newly widowed person, especially if you are an English language learner, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some of the common difficulties that beginners might encounter:

1. Language barriers: If your native language is not English, you may find it difficult to communicate effectively in a professional setting. You may struggle with understanding job descriptions, negotiating salaries, or even making small talk with colleagues.
2. Lack of experience: As a beginner English speaker, you may not have the same level of experience as native speakers. This can make it harder to compete for jobs that require specific skills or knowledge.
3. Limited network: If you are new to an area or industry, you may not have a strong professional network to rely on for job opportunities or recommendations.
