As a non-binary person, I must first acknowledge that the legal system is designed for binary gender categories (male and female) and can be challenging for individuals who do not identify within these narrow parameters. Here are some of the specific challenges middle-aged non-binary people may face in the legal system:

1. Lack of recognition: Non-binary individuals may find it difficult to have their identity recognized by legal authorities, as many forms and documents require a male or female designation. This can lead to issues with things like driver's licenses, passports, and other important documents.
2. Inadequate legal protection: Laws and regulations are often drafted with binary gender categories in mind, which can leave non-binary individuals without adequate legal protection. For example, hate crime laws may not include non-binary individuals as a protected class, leaving them vulnerable to discrimination and violence.
3. Difficulty accessing healthcare: Non-binary individuals may face challenges when seeking medical care, as many healthcare providers are not trained in providing care that is sensitive to non-binary identities. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, or inadequate treatment.
4. Legal barriers to marriage: Many legal systems have laws that require individuals to be of a specific gender to get married. Non-binary individuals may face challenges in getting legally married if they do not identify as male or female.
5. Discrimination in employment: Non-binary individuals may face discrimination in the workplace, as many job applications and employee handbooks assume a binary gender identity. This can lead to issues with things like bathroom access, dress code policies, and other forms of discrimination.
6. Lack of representation in court: Non-binary individuals may have difficulty finding legal representation that is knowledgeable about their specific needs and experiences. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of advocacy for their rights.
7. Inadequate support services: Many support services, such as domestic violence shelters or sexual assault resources, are not equipped to provide support to non-binary individuals. This can leave them without access to critical resources and support.
8. Erasure in legal documents: Non-binary individuals may face erasure or invisibility in legal documents
