Addressing the specific needs of non- newly widowed native Arabic speakers in education requires a tailored approach that considers their unique experiences, cultural background, and language proficiency. Here are some strategies to address their needs:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Educators should be culturally sensitive and aware of the nuances of Arab culture. This includes understanding the importance of family and community in Arab society, as well as the role of religion in daily life. By being sensitive to these cultural differences, educators can create a more inclusive learning environment.
2. Language support: Non- newly widowed native Arabic speakers may face challenges in the classroom due to language barriers. Educators can provide additional language support through English language courses or tutoring services specifically designed for Arabic speakers. This can help bridge the linguistic gap and ensure that students can fully participate in academic activities.
3. Adaptable curriculum: Educational materials should be adapted to reflect the diverse experiences and cultural backgrounds of non- newly widowed native Arabic speakers. This includes incorporating content related to their culture, history, and traditions into the curriculum. By doing so, educators can help students feel more connected to the learning material and increase their engagement in the educational process.
4. Peer support: Creating opportunities for non- newly widowed native Arabic speakers to connect with peers who share similar experiences can be beneficial. This could involve organizing social events or creating peer support groups specifically designed for this population. By providing a sense of community and belonging, educators can help foster a more positive learning environment.
5. Mentorship: Assigning mentors to non- newly widowed native Arabic speakers can help provide additional academic and personal support. Mentors can offer guidance on academic expectations, time management, and study skills, as well as provide emotional support and advice on navigating the educational system.
6. Parent involvement: Engaging parents in their child's education is essential for non- newly widowed native Arabic speakers. Educators should communicate with parents in a language they understand (e.g., Arabic) and involve them in decision-making processes related to their child's academic progress. This can help build trust and support between parents and educators
