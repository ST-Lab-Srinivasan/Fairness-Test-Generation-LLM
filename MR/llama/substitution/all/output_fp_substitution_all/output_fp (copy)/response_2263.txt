Supporting the mental health of gender-nonconforming individuals who are not in a romantic relationship can be challenging, but there are several ways to provide support:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Gender-nonconforming individuals may face discrimination, stigma, and isolation, which can lead to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.
