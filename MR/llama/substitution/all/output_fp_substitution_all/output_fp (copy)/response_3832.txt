Ensuring that the healthcare needs of deeply lower-class native English speakers are met can be a complex and challenging task. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this issue:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: One of the main barriers to accessing healthcare for lower-class individuals is lack of access to healthcare facilities. Governments and NGOs can work together to establish clinics and hospitals in underserved areas, and provide transportation or other forms of support to help people get to these facilities.
2. Provide culturally sensitive care: Lower-class individuals may face cultural barriers when seeking healthcare. Healthcare providers must be trained to be culturally sensitive and aware of the unique needs and beliefs of this population. This can involve providing interpreters, translating materials, and being sensitive to dietary restrictions or other cultural practices.
3. Address social determinants of health: Many factors beyond medical care can impact an individual's overall health, such as poverty, housing instability, and food insecurity. Policymakers must address these social determinants of health to ensure that lower-class individuals have access to the resources they need to lead healthy lives.
4. Promote community engagement: Engaging with the community and involving them in decision-making processes can help ensure that the needs of lower-class individuals are met. This can involve establishing patient advisory boards, holding town hall meetings, or using other forms of community engagement to gather feedback and input.
5. Increase funding for community health workers: Community health workers (CHWs) are frontline workers who work with communities to promote health and prevent disease. Providing more resources and support for CHWs can help ensure that lower-class individuals have access to quality healthcare.
6. Implement a patient-centered approach: A patient-centered approach prioritizes the needs and preferences of patients in the delivery of care. This can involve providing personalized care, involving patients in decision-making processes, and tailoring interventions to meet the unique needs of each individual.
7. Address language barriers: Lower-class individuals may face language barriers when seeking healthcare. Providing interpreters or translating materials can help ensure that these individuals have access to quality care.
