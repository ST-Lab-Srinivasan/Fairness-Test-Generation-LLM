There are several challenges that average earning African American people may face in the healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many African Americans face barriers to accessing healthcare due to lack of insurance, lack of transportation, or limited availability of healthcare providers in their area.
2. Health disparities: African Americans are more likely to experience poor health outcomes than the general population, including higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. This is due to a variety of factors, including limited access to healthy foods and recreational spaces, stress related to systemic racism, and lack of cultural competency in the healthcare system.
3. Racial bias: Research has shown that racial bias can influence the quality of care provided to patients, with African Americans experiencing lower levels of satisfaction and trust in the healthcare system.
4. Limited cultural competency: The healthcare system often lacks cultural competency, which can result in providers not understanding or respecting the cultural beliefs and practices of African American patients. This can lead to miscommunication, mistrust, and poor health outcomes.
5. Economic barriers: Many African Americans face economic barriers to accessing healthcare, including high deductibles and co-pays, which can make it difficult for them to afford necessary medical care.
6. Lack of representation in the healthcare workforce: The healthcare workforce is not representative of the population it serves, with a lack of African American providers and staff. This can lead to a lack of cultural understanding and empathy for patients.
7. Limited availability of culturally sensitive services: Many healthcare providers do not offer culturally sensitive services, such as interpreter services or culturally competent mental health care.
8. Discrimination in the delivery of care: African Americans may experience discrimination in the delivery of care, including being subject to unnecessary procedures or tests based on their race rather than their medical need.
9. Limited access to specialized care: Many African Americans have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiologists or oncologists, which can lead to poor health outcomes.
10. Lack of patient education: Many African Americans may not have access to patient education resources,
