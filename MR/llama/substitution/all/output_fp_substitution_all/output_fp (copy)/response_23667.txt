Advocating for the rights of native Arabic speakers in the military can be a challenging task, but there have been several successful efforts throughout history. Here are some examples:

1. Desert Storm Veterans: In the 1990s, a group of Arabic-speaking soldiers who served in the Gulf War formed the "Desert Storm Veterans" organization to advocate for their rights. They pushed for recognition of their service and language skills, and eventually received official recognition from the US military for their contributions.
2. Iraqi and Afghan Linguist Program: In the early 2000s, a program was established to recognize and compensate linguists who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. This program acknowledged the critical role that Arabic speakers played in the wars and provided benefits to those who had served as linguists.
3. Language Access Improvement Act: In 2016, the US Congress passed the Language Access Improvement Act, which aimed to improve language access for limited English proficient military members. The act established a language access plan for the military and provided funding for language training and interpretation services.
4. Military Linguist Association: In 2018, a group of linguists formed the Military Linguist Association (MLA) to advocate for the rights of military linguists. The MLA pushed for recognition of linguists' contributions to national security and advocated for better language training and support.
5. Arabic Language Skills in the Military: In 2019, the US Department of Defense published a report highlighting the importance of Arabic language skills in the military. The report recognized the strategic value of Arabic-speaking personnel and outlined measures to improve language training and support for linguists.
6. Linguist Pay Grade Increase: In 2020, the US military introduced a new pay grade structure that recognized the critical role of linguists in national security. The new structure provided higher pay grades for linguists with advanced proficiency in Arabic and other languages.
7. Military Culture and Language Institute: In 2020, the US Army established the Military Culture and Language Institute (MCLI) to provide language training and cultural awareness programs for military personnel. The MCLI
