As a person over 90 years old and an advanced beginner Spanish speaker, there are several challenges you may face when interacting with the healthcare system in Spain. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: Even if you are fluent in Spanish, there may be medical terminology or jargon that you are not familiar with, which can create confusion when communicating with healthcare professionals.
2. Cultural Differences: The healthcare system in Spain may have different cultural norms and practices than what you are used to in your home country. For example, the concept of patient autonomy and self-advocacy may be different than what you are used to.
