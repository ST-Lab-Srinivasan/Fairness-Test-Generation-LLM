Cultural exchange plays a significant role in fostering understanding and unity among mixed Hispanic heritage active duty military groups. By engaging in cultural practices and traditions from different countries and communities, members of these groups can gain a deeper appreciation for the diversity within their own heritage and develop empathy for the experiences of others.
