Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of native Arabic speaker elderly adults. In many parts of the world, older adults are often marginalized and face discrimination based on their age and political beliefs. This study aims to explore the impact of political affiliation on the lives of native Arabic speaker elderly adults in the Middle East and North Africa.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that older adults who are politically active are more likely to experience cognitive decline and mental health problems (Kim et al., 2016). This is particularly true for those who are exposed to political stress and conflict, such as war and violence (Tottenham et al., 2013). Additionally, older adults who identify with a particular political ideology may experience social isolation and exclusion from their communities (Hill et al., 2017).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of native Arabic speaker elderly adults in the Middle East and North Africa, assessing their political affiliation, cognitive functioning, mental health, and social isolation. Additionally, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants to gather more in-depth information on their experiences and perceptions.

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the impact of political affiliation on the lives of native Arabic speaker elderly adults. By examining the relationship between political beliefs and cognitive functioning, mental health, and social isolation, this research will provide valuable insights into the ways in which political affiliation can affect the well-being of older adults. Findings from this study may inform policy and interventions aimed at promoting the cognitive and mental health of elderly adults, particularly those who are politically active.

Expected Outcomes:
We expect to find that political affiliation is associated with cognitive decline and mental health problems in native Arabic speaker elderly adults. Specifically, we predict that older adults who identify as politically active will experience greater cognitive decline and mental health problems compared to those who are less politically active.
