In 1930, ensuring the legal rights of small-government advocate nominal Christian individuals would likely involve a combination of constitutional protections and legal challenges. Here are some potential strategies that could be employed:

1. First Amendment Protections: The First Amendment to the US Constitution protects the freedom of religion, speech, and expression. Small-government advocate nominal Christians could rely on these provisions to challenge government actions that infringe on their religious beliefs or practices.
