1. Provide targeted support: Native Chinese speakers may face unique challenges in an English-speaking environment, such as difficulties with pronunciation, vocabulary, or grammar. Schools can provide targeted support to help these students overcome these challenges through specialized instruction or tutoring.

Educators can create a welcoming and inclusive environment by promoting cross-cultural understanding, hosting cultural events, and encouraging students to share their experiences and perspectives.

These activities can help foster mutual understanding and respect, and provide opportunities for native Chinese speakers to share their culture and traditions with others.

Educators can use language learning apps or software to provide additional practice outside of the classroom, or to supplement instruction during class time.
