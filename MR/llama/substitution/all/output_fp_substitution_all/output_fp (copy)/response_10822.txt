Regarding the challenges faced by over 90 years young Native natural-born US citizen people in the legal system, there are several issues that they may encounter. Here are some of the most common challenges:

1. Lack of cultural understanding: The legal system can often be unfamiliar and alienating for Indigenous peoples, particularly those who have experienced historical trauma related to colonization and forced assimilation. This lack of cultural understanding can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can negatively impact the legal process.
2. Limited access to resources: Many Indigenous communities face barriers to accessing legal resources, including inadequate funding, limited access to legal aid organizations, and a lack of culturally competent legal services. This can make it difficult for elders and other community members to navigate the legal system effectively.
3. Discrimination and bias: Indigenous peoples may face discrimination and bias within the legal system, particularly in areas such as law enforcement, the courts, and corrections. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of trust in the legal system.
4. Lack of representation: Indigenous peoples may have limited access to legal representation, particularly in cases involving complex legal issues or technical legal arguments. This can make it difficult for them to effectively advocate for their rights and interests within the legal system.
5. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has had a profound impact on Indigenous communities, leading to intergenerational trauma that can manifest in various ways. This historical trauma can make it challenging for elders and other community members to navigate the legal system and access justice.
6. Lack of cultural relevance: The legal system may not be culturally relevant or responsive to the needs and values of Indigenous peoples
