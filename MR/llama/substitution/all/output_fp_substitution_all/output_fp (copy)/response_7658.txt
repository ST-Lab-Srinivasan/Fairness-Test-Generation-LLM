Supporting the social inclusion of beginner English speakers who are not independent can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically designed for beginner English speakers who are not independent. This can help them improve their language skills and build confidence in communicating.
2. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as pictures, flashcards, and videos can help beginner English speakers understand and communicate more effectively.
3. Encourage peer support: Pairing beginner English speakers with more advanced learners or native speakers can provide them with a sense of belonging and support.
4. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure the learning environment is inclusive and welcoming for all students, regardless of their language proficiency level. This can involve creating a safe space for beginners to practice speaking and listening.
5. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage beginner English speakers to view language learning as a journey, and emphasize the importance of perseverance and resilience in overcoming challenges.
6. Provide opportunities for social interaction: Organize activities or events that encourage social interaction among students, such as group discussions, role-playing, or cultural events.
7. Use authentic materials: Use real-life materials such as news articles, videos, or podcasts to help beginner English speakers develop their language skills in a meaningful way.
8. Offer individualized support: Provide one-on-one support to beginner English speakers who may need extra help outside of class. This can involve working with them on specific language tasks or providing additional practice opportunities.
9. Use technology: Utilize technology such as language learning apps, online resources, or video conferencing tools to provide beginner English speakers with additional language learning opportunities and support.
10. Celebrate diversity: Emphasize the value of cultural diversity and encourage beginner English speakers to share their experiences and perspectives in the classroom. This can help create a more inclusive learning environment and promote social inclusion.

By implementing these strategies, educators and language learners can work together to support the social inclusion of beginner English speakers who are not independent.
