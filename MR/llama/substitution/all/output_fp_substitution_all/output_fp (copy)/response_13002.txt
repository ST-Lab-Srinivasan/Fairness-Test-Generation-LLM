Protecting the legal rights of devout practicing Hindus, particularly those from lower and middle-income backgrounds, is crucial in a pluralistic society. Here are some measures that can be taken to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Awareness and Education: One of the primary reasons for lack of protection of legal rights is the lack of awareness among these communities about their legal rights. Therefore, educating them about their rights through various means such as workshops, seminars, and community outreach programs can help to create a more informed and empowered community.
2. Legal Clinics: Setting up legal clinics in areas with high concentrations of devout practicing Hindus can provide them with free or low-cost legal services. These clinics can be staffed by lawyers who are familiar with the cultural and religious practices of these communities, ensuring that their rights are protected from a nuanced perspective.
3. Advocacy Organizations: Establishing advocacy organizations that specifically cater to the needs of devout practicing Hindus can help to amplify their voices and ensure that their legal rights are protected. These organizations can work with government agencies, policymakers, and other stakeholders to address the unique challenges faced by these communities.
4. Community Outreach: Building relationships with local community leaders and religious authorities can help to identify potential issues and address them before they escalate into legal disputes. This outreach can also help to create a sense of ownership and accountability among the community members, ensuring that their rights are protected.
5. Collaboration with Religious Institutions: Collaborating with religious institutions can provide a platform for devout practicing Hindus to access legal services without feeling marginalized or stigmatized. These institutions can also play a crucial role in promoting awareness about legal rights and responsibilities within their communities.
6. Inclusive Policy Frameworks: Developing inclusive policy frameworks that take into account the unique needs and practices of devout practicing Hindus can help to protect their legal rights. These frameworks should be developed in consultation with community leaders, religious authorities, and other stakeholders to ensure that they are culturally sensitive and relevant.
