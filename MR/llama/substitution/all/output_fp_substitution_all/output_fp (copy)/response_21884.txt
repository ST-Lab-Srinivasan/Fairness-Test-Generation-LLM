Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are mixed African American individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the audience: It's essential to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience, including their language level, cultural background, and interests. Conducting surveys or focus groups can help gather this information.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the program's content and activities reflect the diversity of the Arabic-speaking mixed African American community. This could involve incorporating music, art, literature, and other cultural elements from different countries and communities within the broader Middle Eastern and North African region.
3. Provide language learning opportunities: Offer beginner Arabic classes tailored to the needs and level of the participants. Consider hiring bilingual instructors who are familiar with the cultural backgrounds of the students.
4. Create a welcoming environment: Foster an inclusive atmosphere where all participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences and learning from one another. Encourage intercultural dialogue and exchange, and provide opportunities for participants to connect with each other outside of the program.
5. Address cultural sensitivities: Be aware of cultural differences and be sensitive to the historical and contemporary issues affecting the Arabic-speaking mixed African American community. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or appropriating cultural practices without proper understanding or permission.
6. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local organizations that cater to the Arabic-speaking mixed African American community, such as mosques, community centers, or cultural festivals. This can help leverage resources and expertise, as well as provide opportunities for cross-cultural exchange.
7. Offer flexible programming: Accommodate the diverse schedules and needs of participants by offering programs at various times and locations. Provide options for both in-person and online learning to cater to different preferences.
8. Foster a sense of community: Encourage participants to connect with each other through social events, volunteer opportunities, or regular gatherings. This can help build a supportive network and foster a sense of belonging among the participants.
9. Provide resources for further learning: Offer access to additional language learning materials
