Family support plays a significant role in the success of Native American natural-born US citizens who carry genetic conditions. Here are some ways in which family support can help:

1. Emotional Support: Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging, and family support can provide a sense of security and belonging. Family members can offer emotional support by listening to the individual's concerns, providing encouragement, and helping them cope with the emotional impact of the condition.
2. Practical Assistance: Family members can provide practical assistance such as help with daily tasks, transportation, and errands. They can also help with managing the individual's care and treatment plan, such as reminding them to take medication or attend appointments.
3. Financial Support: Genetic conditions can be expensive to manage, and family support can provide financial assistance. This can include helping with medical expenses, transportation costs, and other related expenses.
4. Advocacy: Family members can act as advocates for the individual, helping them navigate the healthcare system and accessing resources and services that can help them manage their condition. They can also advocate for the individual's needs within their community and society at large.
5. Social Support: Living with a genetic condition can be isolating, but family support can provide social connections and opportunities to connect with others who share similar experiences. This can help the individual feel less isolated and more connected to their community.
6. Cultural Support: For Native American individuals, cultural support from their family can help them navigate cultural expectations and practices related to health and wellness. Family members can provide cultural guidance and support, helping the individual maintain their cultural identity and connections to their community.
7. Role Modeling: Family members can serve as role models for the individual, demonstrating positive behaviors and attitudes related to managing a genetic condition. They can also model healthy coping strategies and provide examples of how to navigate challenges and obstacles.
8. Building Resilience: Family support can help build resilience in the individual, enabling them to cope with the emotional and practical challenges of living with a genetic condition. By providing emotional and practical support, family members can help the individual develop coping strategies and build resilience over time.
