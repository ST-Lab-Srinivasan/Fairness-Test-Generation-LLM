Creating more inclusive community events for individuals with genetic conditions, including those who are strongly LGBTQ, requires thoughtful planning and consideration. Here are some strategies to help make these events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities and expressions. Avoid using language that is binary or assumes a certain gender identity. For example, instead of saying "guys," use "folks" or "everyone."
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event space is accessible to people with disabilities. This may include providing wheelchair accessibility, audio description, or American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation.
