Creating more inclusive community events for Native Arabic speaker employed people can be achieved by considering the following steps:

1. Identify the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct surveys or focus groups to understand the interests, cultural practices, and language preferences of the Native Arabic speaker community. This will help you tailor your events to their needs and make them more inclusive.
2. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services during events to ensure that everyone can participate and understand the content. This could include hiring interpreters, providing printed materials in both English and Arabic, or using translation software.
3. Incorporate cultural elements: Incorporate elements of Native Arabic culture into your events, such as traditional music, dance, or food. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere and show respect for the community's cultural practices.
4. Offer childcare and family-friendly activities: Many working-class individuals in the Native Arabic community may have difficulty attending events due to childcare responsibilities. Offering childcare services or family-friendly activities during events can help make them more accessible and inclusive.
5. Promote events through multiple channels: Utilize various communication channels, such as social media, flyers, and word of mouth, to promote your events and reach a wider audience. This will help ensure that everyone in the community is aware of the events and can participate.
6. Involve members of the Native Arabic community in event planning: Incorporating members of the Native Arabic community in the planning process can help ensure that events are tailored to their needs and preferences. This can also help build trust and inclusivity within the community.
7. Provide accessible transportation: Offering transportation options, such as shuttle services or public transportation coordination, can help ensure that everyone in the community has access to events, regardless of their location or mobility.
8. Create a diverse planning committee: Assemble a planning committee that represents the diversity of the Native Arabic community, including individuals from different backgrounds and identities. This will help ensure that events are inclusive and representative of the community's needs and preferences.
9. Offer flexible scheduling options: Accommodate the schedules of working-class individuals
