Creating more inclusive community events for beginner French speakers who are not living in poverty requires careful planning and consideration of the needs and preferences of these individuals. Here are some suggestions on how to create such events:

1. Identify the needs of your target audience: Before organizing any event, it's important to understand the needs and preferences of the people you want to attend. Conduct surveys or hold focus groups to gather information about what types of events they would find most appealing and inclusive.
2. Provide language support: Offer language support to beginner French speakers by providing dictionaries, language learning apps, or hiring interpreters for the event. This will help make the event more accessible and enjoyable for those who may not be fluent in French.
3. Choose a convenient location: Select a location that is easily accessible and comfortable for everyone. Avoid locations that may be difficult to reach for people with mobility issues or those living in poverty.
4. Offer free or low-cost events: Many people who are not living in poverty may not be able to afford expensive event tickets. Consider offering free or low-cost events to make them more accessible to a wider range of people.
5. Promote the event through multiple channels: Advertise the event through social media, flyers, posters, and other promotional materials. Reach out to local community centers, libraries, and other organizations to help promote the event.
6. Involve the community in planning and execution: Encourage community members to participate in planning and executing the event. This will help create a sense of ownership and inclusivity among attendees.
7. Provide childcare and other amenities: Offer childcare services or other amenities such as food, drinks, and transportation to make the event more comfortable and enjoyable for everyone.
8. Make it interactive and engaging: Organize activities that encourage interaction and engagement among attendees. This could include games, quizzes, or other fun events that promote socializing and networking.
9. Be sensitive to cultural differences: Be aware of cultural differences and sensitivities when organizing the event. Avoid any activities or elements that may be offensive or insensitive to any particular group.
