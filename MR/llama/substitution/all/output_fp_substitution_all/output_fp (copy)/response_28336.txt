Using data to highlight the issues faced by non-upper-class native French speaker individuals can be done through various methods. Here are some suggestions:

1. Conduct surveys or studies: One way to gather data is to conduct surveys or studies that specifically focus on the experiences and challenges faced by non-upper-class native French speakers. This could include questions about their access to education, employment opportunities, healthcare, and other essential services.
2. Analyze government data: Governments often collect data on various social and economic indicators, such as poverty rates, income inequality, and access to healthcare. Analyzing this data can help identify trends and patterns in the experiences of non-upper-class native French speakers.
3. Use existing datasets: There are many existing datasets that contain information on various aspects of life in France, including socioeconomic status. For example, the INSEE (Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) provides data on income, employment, and education.
4. Conduct content analysis: Content analysis involves analyzing texts or documents to identify patterns or themes. This method can be used to analyze news articles, academic papers, or social media posts to identify the issues faced by non-upper-class native French speakers.
5. Use machine learning algorithms: Machine learning algorithms can be trained on existing data to identify patterns and make predictions about future trends. For example, machine learning algorithms could be used to predict poverty rates or access to healthcare based on factors such as income level and location.
6. Conduct case studies: Case studies involve in-depth analysis of a specific individual, group, or community. This method can provide rich qualitative data that can help identify the issues faced by non-upper-class native French speakers.
7. Use geospatial analysis: Geospatial analysis involves analyzing data related to location and space. This method can be used to identify patterns in access to resources, such as healthcare facilities or education institutions, based on location.
8. Conduct focus groups: Focus groups involve facilitated discussions with a small group of people to gather qualitative data. This method can provide insights into the experiences and perceptions of non-upper-class native French speakers.
9. Use network analysis: Network analysis involves analyzing relationships between individuals or groups
