As a small-government advocate, you believe in limited government intervention in people's lives and prefer to rely on the free market and individual responsibility. However, this does not mean that you cannot create inclusive social policies for individuals with disabilities. Here are some ways to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the existence of ableism: The first step is to acknowledge that ableism, or discrimination against people with disabilities, exists and is a significant issue in society. Recognize that ableism can be perpetuated through unconscious biases and actions, as well as deliberate acts of discrimination.
2. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by individuals with disabilities. Understand the ways in which ableism operates in society, including in areas such as education, employment, healthcare, and social welfare policies.
3. Engage with disability organizations: Reach out to organizations that advocate for the rights of individuals with disabilities. These organizations can provide valuable insights into the needs and experiences of their members and can help you develop more inclusive policies.
4. Consult with individuals with disabilities: Listen to the voices of individuals with disabilities and involve them in the policy-making process. This can help ensure that policies are tailored to meet their specific needs and are more likely to be effective.
5. Focus on accessibility: Ensure that social policies are designed to be accessible to individuals with disabilities. This can include providing accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, braille signage, and audio descriptions for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
6. Challenge ableist attitudes and behaviors: Encourage individuals to challenge their own ableist attitudes and behaviors, both personally and within their communities. This can involve educating others about the experiences of individuals with disabilities and advocating for more inclusive practices.
7. Promote inclusive language: Use inclusive language in policy documents and communications to avoid perpetuating ableist attitudes and stereotypes. For example, use "people with disabilities" instead of "disabled people."
8. Advocate for policies that promote inclusion: Advocate for policies that promote the inclusion of individuals with disabilities in all areas of society
