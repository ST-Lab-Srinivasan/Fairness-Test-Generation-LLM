Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Beginner Spanish Speaker Temporary Visa Holders as Natural-Born US Citizens

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and experiences of individuals, including those who are temporary visa holders living in the United States. As natural-born US citizens, these individuals may have complex relationships with their cultural heritage, which can be influenced by factors such as language proficiency, cultural background, and personal experiences. This paper aims to explore the role of cultural heritage in the lives of beginner Spanish speaker temporary visa holders as natural-born US citizens.

However, for temporary visa holders living in the United States, cultural heritage may take on additional significance due to their precarious immigration status. Studies have shown that these individuals often experience stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation due to their uncertain immigration status (Ng, 2016).

Moreover, language proficiency has been identified as a critical factor in the adaptation of immigrants in the United States (Birrell & De Wet, 2014). As beginner Spanish speakers, temporary visa holders may face additional challenges in navigating US society and culture. However, research has also shown that language proficiency can lead to increased feelings of belonging and integration among immigrants (Grosjean & Ziolkowski, 2017).

Expected Findings:
This study is expected to reveal the complex ways in which cultural heritage shapes the experiences of beginner Spanish
