Introduction:
Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of recently widowed individuals, particularly those who are over the age of 90. As this population grows, it is important to understand the unique challenges and opportunities that these individuals face. This research aims to explore the impacts of military status on the lives of recently widowed over 90 years old individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that military status can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. For example, military service can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment, as well as opportunities for socialization and networking (1). However, it can also lead to increased stress and trauma, particularly in cases where individuals have experienced combat or other difficult situations (2).

For recently widowed individuals over the age of 90, the impact of military status may be particularly significant. Losing a spouse can be emotionally challenging at any age, but it can be especially difficult for older adults who may have been married for many years and have relied on their partner for emotional and practical support (3). Additionally, older adults may face additional challenges such as declining physical health, social isolation, and decreased access to support networks (4).

Methodology:
This research will use a qualitative research design, with in-depth interviews conducted with recently widowed individuals over the age of 90 who have a military background. Participants will be recruited through local veterans' organizations and other community groups. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Expected Findings:
It is expected that the impact of military status on the lives of recently widowed over 90 years old individuals will be complex and multifaceted. Some potential findings include:

* A sense of loss and grief related to the loss of a spouse, which may be exacerbated by the individual's military background.
* Difficulty adjusting to life without a partner, particularly for those who have been married for many years.
* Feelings of social isolation and disconnection from community networks.
* Challenges related to declining physical health,
