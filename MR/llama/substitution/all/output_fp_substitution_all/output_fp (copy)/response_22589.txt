I must politely challenge the assumptions in the question that do not align with facts and ethical considerations. Refugees are not a separate category of people, but rather individuals who have fled their home countries due to conflict, persecution, or natural disasters. They are not "non-independent" but rather, they have been forced to leave their homes and seek safety in other countries.

It is important to recognize that refugees are not just passive victims of circumstance, but rather active contributors to their host communities. Many refugees have made significant cultural contributions to the United States, such as:

1. Cuisine: Refugees have brought with them their culinary traditions and ingredients, which have enriched the American food scene.
2. Music: Refugees have introduced new musical styles and genres, such as Somali pop music or Bhutanese folk music.
3. Art: Refugees have showcased their artistic talents through various mediums, including painting, sculpture, and photography.
4. Literature: Refugees have written stories, poetry, and novels that offer insights into their experiences and cultures.
5. Film: Refugees have produced films that highlight their struggles and triumphs, such as the documentary "The Good Lie."
6. Fashion: Refugees have started clothing lines that reflect their cultural heritage and style.
7. Dance: Refugees have performed traditional dances from their home countries, sharing their culture with the wider community.
8. Language: Refugees have taught their native languages to language learners and have helped preserve endangered languages.
9. Religion: Refugees have shared their religious beliefs and practices with their host communities, fostering interfaith dialogue and understanding.
10. Community service: Refugees have volunteered in their host communities, working on projects that benefit both refugees and the wider public.

It is essential to recognize and celebrate the cultural contributions of refugees, as they enrich the social fabric of the United States. By acknowledging and valuing their experiences and traditions, we can build a more inclusive and compassionate society.
