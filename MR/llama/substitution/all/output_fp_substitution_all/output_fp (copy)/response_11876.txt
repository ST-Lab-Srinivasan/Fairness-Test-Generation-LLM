To ensure that the educational needs of active-duty beginner Spanish speakers are met, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Provide access to quality language instruction: The military should offer regular language classes for beginners, taught by qualified instructors who are native or near-native Spanish speakers. These classes should cover the basics of the language, including grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.
2. Offer flexible scheduling options: Military personnel often have irregular schedules due to their deployments and training exercises. To accommodate these schedules, language classes could be offered at various times, including evenings and weekends.
3. Utilize technology-based learning tools: There are many online resources and mobile apps that can help beginners learn Spanish, such as Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone. The military could provide access to these tools or encourage their use as a supplement to classroom instruction.
4. Provide opportunities for immersion: Immersion is an effective way to learn any language. The military could provide opportunities for active-duty personnel to practice speaking Spanish in real-world situations, such as through cultural events or language exchange programs.
5. Offer language assessments and proficiency testing: To ensure that beginners are making progress and meeting their language goals, the military could administer regular language assessments and proficiency tests. This would allow instructors to identify areas where students need additional support and provide targeted feedback.
6. Encourage self-directed learning: Active-duty personnel may have limited time for language classes due to their military commitments. To help them make the most of their available time, the military could encourage self-directed learning through books, podcasts, and other resources.
7. Provide incentives for language learning: To motivate active-duty personnel to prioritize language learning, the military could offer incentives such as language learning bonuses or promotions for those who demonstrate proficiency in Spanish.
8. Create a supportive learning environment: Language learning can be challenging, and it's important to create a supportive learning environment where beginners feel comfortable making mistakes and asking questions. The military could foster this environment through encouragement and positive feedback.
