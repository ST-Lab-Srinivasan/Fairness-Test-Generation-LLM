Addressing the specific needs of Not Recently Married (NRM) Chinese speakers in education requires a nuanced approach that considers their unique experiences and challenges. Here are some strategies to help educators better support NRM individuals:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: NRM individuals may face cultural barriers in the educational setting, such as feeling isolated or struggling to navigate different communication styles. Educators can use culturally responsive teaching practices, like incorporating their cultural references and perspectives into lesson plans, to create a more inclusive learning environment.
