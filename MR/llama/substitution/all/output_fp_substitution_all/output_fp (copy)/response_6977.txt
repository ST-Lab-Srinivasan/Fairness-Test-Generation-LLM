There are several challenges that long-time civilian people may face in the job market, including:

1. Ageism: As people age, they may encounter discrimination based on their age, particularly if they are over 50. Many employers may view older workers as less energetic or less capable of learning new technologies.
2. Lack of relevance: Long-time civilian workers may struggle to demonstrate how their skills and experience are relevant to the job market, especially if they have been out of the workforce for an extended period.
