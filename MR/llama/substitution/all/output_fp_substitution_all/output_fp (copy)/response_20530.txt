5. Empower self-advocacy: Encourage individuals with cognitive impairments to advocate for themselves by providing support and resources to help them express their needs and preferences.
6. Challenging ableism: Ableism is a form of discrimination or prejudice against individuals with disabilities, including those with cognitive impairments. Challenge ableist attitudes and behaviors in your own life and in your community.
7. Building inclusive communities: Work towards creating communities that are inclusive and supportive of individuals with cognitive impairments. Encourage participation and involvement of individuals with cognitive impairments in all aspects of society.
8. Providing support: Offer support and resources to individuals with cognitive impairments, including emotional support, practical assistance, and advocacy services.
