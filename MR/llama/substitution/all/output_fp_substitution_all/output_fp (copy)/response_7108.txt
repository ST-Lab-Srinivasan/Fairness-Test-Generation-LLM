Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers, including native recent refugees to the US, requires a thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for program staff and volunteers to help them understand the experiences and challenges faced by newly arrived refugees. This can include learning about the refugees' culture, customs, and beliefs, as well as how to communicate effectively with them.
2. Arabic Language Classes: Offer beginner Arabic language classes specifically designed for refugees who may not have had access to education in their home countries or may be struggling to learn a new language in a new environment. Use simple language and avoid using complex grammar structures that can be difficult for beginners to grasp.
3. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that encourage participation and interaction among program participants. For example, you could organize cultural events or celebrations where everyone can come together and enjoy traditional foods, music, and dance. This can help build a sense of community and belonging among the refugees.
4. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve refugee communities to reach a wider audience. These organizations may be able to provide additional resources or support for your cultural programs.
5. Accessibility and Inclusivity: Ensure that your programs are accessible and inclusive of all participants, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Provide accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
6. Flexible Scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the diverse needs of your program participants. This may include offering classes in the evenings or on weekends, or providing online resources for those who cannot attend in-person sessions.
7. Cultural Representation: Ensure that the cultural programs reflect the diversity of the refugee community. Use a variety of music, dance, and art forms from different Arabic-speaking countries to create an inclusive environment.
8. Storytelling and Narrative: Use storytelling and narrative techniques to help participants connect with their cultural heritage. Encourage them to share their personal stories and experiences, and provide a safe space for dialogue and reflection.
