Creating more inclusive cultural events for devout practicing Hindus, particularly those who identify as extreme, moderate, or independent, requires sensitivity and understanding of their beliefs and practices. Here are some suggestions to make cultural events more inclusive:

1. Understand and respect beliefs and practices: Take the time to learn about the beliefs and practices of devout Hindus, including their dietary restrictions, rituals, and customs. Be willing to accommodate their needs and avoid imposing non-Hindu traditions on them.
2. Involve Hindu community leaders: Consult with Hindu community leaders and elders to ensure that the event is culturally appropriate and respectful of Hindu beliefs and practices. They can provide valuable insights and help with the planning process.
3. Provide vegetarian options: Many Hindus follow a vegetarian diet, so make sure to provide vegetarian options for food and drinks at the event. This will show respect for their dietary restrictions and make them feel included.
4. Incorporate Hindu music and dance: Incorporate traditional Hindu music and dance into the event to create a cultural experience that is authentic and meaningful to devout practicing Hindus.
5. Offer puja and prayer spaces: Provide designated areas for puja (worship) and prayer, which will allow attendees to practice their faith in a comfortable and respectful environment.
6. Be mindful of language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of Hindu beliefs and practices. Avoid using language that is offensive or insensitive, such as using the term "Hinduism" instead of "Sanatana Dharma," which is a more accurate term used by many devout Hindus.
7. Create a safe space: Ensure that the event creates a safe and inclusive environment for all attendees, regardless of their beliefs or practices. This can be achieved by promoting respectful dialogue, avoiding confrontation, and creating a culture of mutual understanding and acceptance.
8. Educate attendees: Provide educational materials or workshops that teach about Hinduism and its practices, which can help attendees understand and appreciate the cultural significance of the event
