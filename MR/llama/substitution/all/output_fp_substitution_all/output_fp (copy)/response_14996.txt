Introduction:

Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, including those who are long-term residents or refugees. In India, the legal and social implications of immigration status can be particularly complex, affecting not only the individual but also their family members and community. This report will explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of long-term recently refugee natural-born Indian citizens.

Impact on Legal Status:

Long-term refugees in India often face challenges in obtaining legal recognition of their status, which can limit their access to basic rights and services. Many refugees are unable to obtain a valid passport or other official documents, making it difficult for them to travel or access healthcare services. For example, the Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in India often face difficulties in obtaining birth certificates, marriage certificates, and other essential documents due to their immigration status (Kurien, 2019).

Refugees in India often experience social exclusion, which can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization. They may face discrimination in education, employment, and other areas of life, making it difficult for them to integrate into Indian society.

Impact on Mental Health:

The stress of living with an uncertain immigration status can have a significant impact on the mental health of refugees.

The lack of access to mental health services can exacerbate these issues, making it crucial for organizations to provide adequate support.

Impact on Education:

Refugees in India often face barriers in accessing education due to their immigration status. Many refugees are unable to enroll in schools or universities, limiting their opportunities for personal and professional growth. For example, the Afghani refugee children in India often miss out on
