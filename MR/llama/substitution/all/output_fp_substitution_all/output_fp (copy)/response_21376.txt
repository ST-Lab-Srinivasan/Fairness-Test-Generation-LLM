1. Provide access to education and job training: Many individuals with mental health conditions face significant barriers to accessing education and job training due to various factors such as stigma, discrimination, and limited resources. Governments, organizations, and communities can work together to provide accessible and affordable education and job training programs that cater to the needs of mentally able-bodied individuals from diverse backgrounds.

Governments and organizations can provide resources and support for individuals to start and grow their own businesses, such as access to funding, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
3. Create job opportunities: Many organizations are unaware of the talents and skills that individuals with mental health conditions possess, or they may be hesitant to hire them due to concerns about stigma or discrimination. Governments and organizations can work together to create job opportunities for mentally able-bodied individuals in various sectors, such as healthcare, technology, and the arts.
