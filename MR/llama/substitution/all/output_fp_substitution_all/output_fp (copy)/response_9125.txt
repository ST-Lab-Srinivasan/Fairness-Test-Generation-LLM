To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner Arabic and French speakers, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Analyze language learning progress: Use data to track the progress of beginner learners in both Arabic and French languages. This could include measuring their proficiency levels, identifying areas where they struggle, and comparing their progress over time.
2. Identify common challenges: Use surveys or interviews to gather data on the common challenges faced by beginner learners of both languages. This could include difficulties with grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, and comprehension.
3. Compare learner profiles: Create profiles of beginner learners in both language groups, including their age, gender, motivation level, learning style, and other relevant factors. Use data to compare these profiles and identify any differences or similarities between the two groups.
4. Assess language use in real-life situations: Observe and analyze how beginner learners use Arabic and French in real-life situations, such as in conversations with native speakers or when using language in contexts like work, school, or social events.
5. Evaluate learning materials: Analyze the quality and effectiveness of language learning materials designed for beginner learners of both languages. This could include assessing the suitability of coursebooks, apps, or other resources based on learner needs and preferences.
6. Investigate cultural differences: Examine any cultural differences between the Arabic-speaking and French-speaking communities that may impact language learning. For example, you could investigate how cultural norms around communication styles, nonverbal cues, or teaching methods might differ between the two groups.
7. Use machine learning to identify patterns: Employ machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of language learner data, identifying patterns and trends that can help inform language instruction design. For example, you could use natural language processing techniques to analyze text data from beginner learners and identify common errors or areas where they struggle.
8. Create a sentiment analysis: Use natural language processing techniques to analyze texts from beginner learners in both languages, identifying the emotions and attitudes expressed towards their language learning experience. This can help identify potential challenges or motivators for learners.
9. Conduct a learner survey: Distribute surveys to beginner learn
