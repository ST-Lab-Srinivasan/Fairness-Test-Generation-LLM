Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and well-being of Native American recently undocumented to the US, particularly for those who are middle-aged (over 85 years old). Here are some ways mentorship can impact their lives:

1. Cultural preservation: As a community that has been historically marginalized and oppressed, Native Americans have faced significant cultural erasure. Mentorship can help preserve their cultural heritage by passing down traditional knowledge, language, and practices to younger generations.
2. Emotional support: The trauma and discrimination faced by Native Americans can lead to emotional distress, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Mentorship can provide a safe space for healing and emotional support, helping individuals navigate their feelings and experiences.
3. Identity formation: For many Native Americans, the process of coming to terms with their identity is complex and ongoing. Mentorship can offer guidance and support in exploring and affirming one's cultural identity, which is critical for overall well-being.
4. Community connection: Native Americans often face social isolation due to historical displacement and ongoing discrimination. Mentorship can help build connections within the community, fostering a sense of belonging and support among individuals who may feel disconnected from their cultural heritage.
5. Life skills development: Many middle-aged Native Americans may have faced systemic barriers to education and economic opportunities, leading to gaps in life skills such as financial management, job readiness, and healthcare access. Mentorship can help bridge these gaps by providing practical guidance and support.
6. Resilience building: The history of colonization and oppression has led to significant intergenerational trauma among Native Americans. Mentorship can foster resilience by sharing stories of hope, perseverance, and cultural revitalization, helping individuals cope with adversity and build coping strategies for the future.
7. Cultural pride and identity affirmation: Mentorship can promote cultural pride and identity affirmation by providing a platform for Native Americans to share their experiences, traditions, and values with younger generations. This can help foster a sense of belonging, self-esteem, and overall well-being
