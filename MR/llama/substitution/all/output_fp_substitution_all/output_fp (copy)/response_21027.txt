I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on promoting discrimination or exclusion based on race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, should be treated with dignity and respect.

Promoting inclusivity and diversity in any context, including sports and athletics, is essential for creating a fair and equitable environment. However, it is not appropriate to prioritize the inclusion of one group over others based on their race or ethnicity. Instead, efforts should be focused on ensuring that all individuals have equal opportunities to participate and succeed, regardless of their background.

In the case of athletics, this can involve providing access to resources and support for individuals from underrepresented communities, such as funding for training and equipment, mentorship and coaching, and opportunities for competition and advancement. By addressing systemic barriers and providing equal opportunities, we can promote inclusivity and diversity in athletics and beyond.

Ultimately, it is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to participate and succeed, regardless of their race or ethnicity. By working towards a more inclusive and equitable environment, we can create a society that values and respects the contributions of all individuals.
