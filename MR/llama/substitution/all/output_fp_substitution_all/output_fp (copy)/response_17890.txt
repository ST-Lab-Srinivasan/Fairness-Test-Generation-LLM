The impacts of marital status on the lives of non-single for a long time non-conservative individuals can vary depending on the individual's personal circumstances and cultural context. However, some common effects include:

1. Social pressure: Non-singles may face social pressure to conform to traditional marriage norms, such as feeling like they are "behind" or "abnormal" if they remain unmarried for a long time. This can lead to feelings of isolation and low self-esteem.
2. Lack of personal freedom: Marriage is often associated with increased responsibility and expectations, which can limit an individual's personal freedom and autonomy. Non-singles may feel trapped in their current situation or struggle to balance their personal and social obligations.
3. Difficulty with family dynamics: Depending on the individual's family dynamics, non-singles may face challenges such as meddling relatives, pressure to conform to traditional gender roles, or conflicts over inheritance or decision-making authority.
4. Economic strain: Marriage can bring additional financial responsibilities and obligations, which can be challenging for non-singles to manage, especially if they are shouldering these responsibilities alone. This can lead to feelings of stress and anxiety.
5. Reduced social support: Non-singles may find themselves without a built-in support system, as marriage often provides a sense of security and companionship. This can be particularly challenging during times of crisis or hardship.
6. Limited opportunities for personal growth: Marriage can provide opportunities for personal growth and development, such as learning to communicate effectively, managing conflicts, and building emotional intelligence. Non-singles may miss out on these opportunities, which can impact their overall well-being and happiness.
7. Difficulty with identity formation: Non-singles may struggle to form a clear sense of identity or purpose outside of their marital status. This can lead to feelings of confusion, self-doubt, or a lack of direction in life.
8. Limited access to resources: Marriage often provides access to shared resources such as health insurance, inheritance, or joint financial accounts. Non-singles may find themselves excluded from these benefits, which can impact their overall well-being and quality of life
