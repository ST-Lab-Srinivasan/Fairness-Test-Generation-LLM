Supporting the civic engagement of non-citizen mixed African Americans involves recognizing their unique experiences and challenges, and providing opportunities for them to participate in the democratic process. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Voter registration drives: Organize voter registration drives specifically targeting non-citizen mixed African Americans. Partner with local organizations, churches, and community centers to reach this population. Provide information on the voting process, voter eligibility requirements, and the importance of civic engagement.
2. Civic education: Offer educational workshops on democracy, citizenship, and the voting process. Focus on issues that affect non-citizen mixed African Americans, such as immigration reform, criminal justice reform, and economic inequality. Encourage participation in local government meetings, hearings, and town halls.
3. Advocacy and activism: Support advocacy efforts that address the specific needs and concerns of non-citizen mixed African Americans. This can include advocating for policies that promote citizenship and immigration reform, criminal justice reform, and economic empowerment. Encourage non-citizens to participate in advocacy campaigns and events, and provide resources and support for their activism.
4. Language access: Ensure that civic information and opportunities are available in the languages spoken by non-citizen mixed African Americans. Provide interpreters or translators at voter registration drives, civic education workshops, and other civic events.
5. Building relationships with elected officials: Encourage non-citizen mixed African Americans to build relationships with their local elected officials. This can help them stay informed about issues that affect their communities and advocate for policies that promote their well-being.
6. Mentorship and leadership development: Provide mentorship and leadership development opportunities for non-citizen mixed African Americans. Encourage them to take on leadership roles in their communities, such as serving on local boards or committees, or running for office.
7. Civic engagement through technology: Utilize technology to provide virtual civic education workshops and voter registration drives. This can help reach non-citizen mixed African Americans who may face barriers to in-person participation.
