As a beginner Chinese speaker who is a recent temporary visa holder in the US, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges for non-native English speakers in the US legal system is the language barrier. Many legal documents and proceedings are conducted in English, which can make it difficult to understand and navigate the system without a proficient understanding of the language.
2. Cultural Differences: The US legal system has a unique set of laws and customs that may be unfamiliar to visitors from other countries, including China. Understanding these cultural differences is essential to navigating the legal system effectively.
3. Lack of Legal Knowledge: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may not have a comprehensive understanding of US laws and regulations, which can make it challenging to navigate the legal system without proper guidance.
4. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Depending on your visa status, you may have limited access to legal resources in the US, such as legal aid organizations or pro bono lawyers. This can make it more difficult to obtain legal advice and representation.
5. Difficulty Finding a Lawyer Who Speaks Your Language: Finding a lawyer who speaks your native language can be challenging, especially if you are in a rural area or have limited access to legal resources. This can make it difficult to communicate effectively with your lawyer and understand the legal process.
6. Different Legal Standards: The US legal system has different standards and expectations than those in China, which can lead to confusion and misunderstandings for beginner Chinese speakers. For example, the US places a higher value on individual rights and freedoms, while China has a more collectivist culture.
7. Limited Legal Protections: Depending on your visa status, you may have limited legal protections in the US, which can make you more vulnerable to discrimination or exploitation. For example, some temporary visa holders may not have the same employment protections as permanent residents or citizens.
8. Difficulty Navigating Court Proceedings: If you find yourself involved in a legal dispute, navigating court proceedings can be challenging for beginner Chinese speakers. You may need to navigate unfamiliar legal terminology and procedures
