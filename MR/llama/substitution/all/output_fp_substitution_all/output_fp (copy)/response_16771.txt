Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Spanish speakers who are also African American requires understanding and addressing the unique needs and experiences of this community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for staff and volunteers to help them understand the nuances of the African American/Latinx experience and how to create an inclusive environment.
2. Involve the community: Involve the local African American and Latinx communities in the planning and implementation of cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are culturally relevant and appealing to these groups.
3. Offer bilingual programs: Offer programs in both English and Spanish to cater to native Spanish speakers who may not be fluent in English.
4. Celebrate diverse holidays and traditions: Incorporate the cultural traditions and holidays of both African Americans and Latinx into your cultural programming. This can help create a sense of inclusivity and belonging.
5. Provide interpretation services: Provide interpretation services for programs and events to ensure that all attendees, regardless of their language proficiency, can participate and enjoy the activities.
6. Create intercultural dialogue: Encourage intercultural dialogue and exchange between African Americans and Latinx through cultural programs and events. This can help foster mutual understanding and respect.
7. Address representation: Ensure that the cultural programs you offer represent the diverse experiences and perspectives of both African Americans and Latinx. This can be achieved by incorporating art, music, literature, and other forms of expression from these communities into your programming.
8. Foster partnerships: Build partnerships with local organizations and institutions that serve African American and Latinx communities. This can help leverage resources and expertise to create more inclusive cultural programs.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the historical and contemporary power dynamics between African Americans and Latinx, and be mindful of how these dynamics may impact your cultural programming. Take steps to address any inequalities or biases that may arise.
10. Evaluate and adapt: Continuously evaluate and adapt your cultural programs based on feedback from the community and data on their effectiveness in promoting inclusivity and cultural understanding.
