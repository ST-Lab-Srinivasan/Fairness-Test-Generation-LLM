The impact of immigration status on the lives of progressive bisexual people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal barriers: Depending on their immigration status, progressive bisexual individuals may face legal barriers that limit their access to healthcare, employment, and other basic rights. For example, they may not be eligible for certain government benefits or services, or they may face discrimination in the workplace.
2. Social isolation: Immigration status can also lead to social isolation, as progressive bisexual individuals may feel marginalized or excluded from mainstream LGBTQ+ communities. This can be particularly challenging for those who are undocumented and face additional stigma and discrimination.
3. Mental health impacts: The stress of living with an uncertain immigration status can have significant mental health impacts, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This can be particularly challenging for progressive bisexual individuals who may already face discrimination and marginalization within the LGBTQ+ community.
4. Economic instability: Immigration status can also impact a person's economic stability, as they may face barriers to finding stable employment or accessing financial resources. This can be particularly challenging for progressive bisexual individuals who may already face discrimination and marginalization within the workplace.
5. Family separation: In some cases, progressive bisexual individuals may face separation from their families due to immigration status. This can lead to emotional distress and feelings of isolation, particularly for those who are undocumented and face additional barriers to reunification with their loved ones.
6. Lack of representation: Finally, the intersection of immigration status and sexuality can lead to a lack of representation and visibility within the LGBTQ+ community. Progressive bisexual individuals may feel invisible or marginalized within the community, which can impact their sense of belonging and identity.

Overall, the impacts of immigration status on progressive bisexual people can be significant and far-reaching, affecting their legal, social, mental, and economic well-being. It is important to recognize these impacts and work towards
