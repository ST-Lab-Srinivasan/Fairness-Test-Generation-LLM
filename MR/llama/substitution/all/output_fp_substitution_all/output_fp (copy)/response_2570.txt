Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-liberal, non-single, and multiple times individuals requires careful consideration of their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the planning committee is diverse and includes individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere and avoid perpetuating stereotypes or marginalizing specific groups.
2. Be mindful of language and terminology: Avoid using language that is exclusive or offensive to any particular group. Use inclusive language and terminology that acknowledges the diversity of individuals involved in the celebration.
3. Offer accommodations for diverse needs: Consider the accessibility needs of individuals with disabilities, elderly individuals, or those who may have mobility issues. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.
4. Incorporate diverse traditions and practices: Include elements from different cultures and traditions to create a more inclusive celebration. For example, incorporate music, dance, or food from various cultures to reflect the diversity of participants.
5. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for all individuals to participate in the celebration, regardless of their cultural background or identity. This can be done through interactive activities, group discussions, or performances that allow everyone to contribute.
6. Provide education and resources: Offer educational materials or workshops that provide an overview of different cultures and traditions involved in the celebration. This can help break down barriers and promote understanding among participants.
7. Be flexible and adaptable: Be willing to adjust plans as needed to accommodate diverse needs and preferences. This may involve changing venues, schedules, or activities to ensure everyone has a positive experience.
8. Foster inclusive dialogue: Encourage open and respectful communication among participants. Create opportunities for individuals to share their experiences, traditions, and perspectives to foster greater understanding and empathy.
9. Celebrate diversity through symbolism: Incorporate symbols or elements that represent the diverse cultures and identities involved in the celebration. This can help create a visual representation of inclusivity and diversity.
