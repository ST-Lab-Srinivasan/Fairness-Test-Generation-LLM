Creating more inclusive community events for native Chinese speakers aged over 90 years old (or over 85 years old) requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for elderly attendees, with features such as wheelchair accessibility, wide hallways, and accessible restrooms. Provide transportation options, if necessary, to help them attend the event.
2. Language support: Provide interpretation services, such as translators or Cantonese or Mandarin language subtitles, to ensure that all attendees can understand and participate in the event.

8. Flexible seating: Provide flexible seating options, such as comfortable chairs or cushions, to accommodate different mobility needs.
9. Food and beverages: Offer a variety of food and beverage options that cater to different dietary needs and preferences.
