Creating more inclusive community events for individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, including those who identify as cisgender or gender-fluid, requires thoughtful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair accessible and has enough seating for expectant mothers who may need to rest during the event. Provide gender-neutral bathrooms or allow attendees to choose their preferred bathroom.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all promotional materials, including flyers, social media posts, and event descriptions. Avoid using binary gender terms like "mom" or "dad." Instead, use phrases like "expectant parents," "family," or "community."
3. Gender-neutral decor: Use gender-neutral decorations and props during the event to create a welcoming environment for all attendees. Avoid using gendered themes or colors that may be alienating for non-binary or genderqueer individuals.
4. Childcare: Provide childcare options for attendees who may need assistance caring for their children during the event. This can include hiring babysitters, setting up a play area with toys and books, or offering breastfeeding stations.
5. Inclusive activities: Plan activities that are inclusive of all expectant parents, regardless of gender identity. For example, you could have a group meditation or yoga class, a craft station for making baby blankets or onesies, or a photo booth with props for capturing memories with their families.
6. Safe space: Designate a safe space for attendees who may need a quiet and comfortable area to rest or express themselves during the event. This could be a designated area in the venue or a separate room with comfortable seating and refreshments.
7. Education: Offer educational workshops or resources during the event that cater to the diverse needs of expectant parents, including those who identify as gender-fluid or non-binary. Topics could include prenatal care, babywearing, or parenting strategies.
8. Volunteer support: Train volunteers to be sensitive to the needs
