As a native French speaker and recent green card holder to the US, there are several challenges you may face when navigating the US healthcare system. Here are some of the common obstacles:

1. Language barrier: If you don't speak English fluently, communicating with healthcare providers can be difficult. You may struggle to understand medical terminology, fill out forms, or communicate your symptoms and concerns.
2. Cultural differences: The US healthcare system has different cultural norms and expectations than those in France. For example, patients in the US are often expected to take a more active role in managing their own care, whereas in France, the healthcare system is more paternalistic. This can lead to misunderstandings or frustration for French speakers who are unfamiliar with these cultural differences.
3. Different payment structures: The US healthcare system operates on a fee-for-service model, which means that patients pay separately for each medical service they receive. In contrast, France has a more centralized and comprehensive universal healthcare system, where patients do not pay directly for most services. This can make it difficult for French speakers to navigate the billing and insurance process in the US.
4. Limited access to certain specialists: Depending on your location in the US, you may have limited access to certain specialists or medical procedures that are available in France. For example, some treatments or tests may not be covered by your insurance, or they may be unavailable at your local hospital.
5. Different standards of care: While both the French and US healthcare systems have their strengths and weaknesses, there can be differences in the quality of care provided. For example, some procedures or treatments may be more commonly used in France than in the US, or vice versa.
6. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The US healthcare system is complex and can be difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with it. You may struggle to find the right provider, understand your insurance coverage, or access necessary medical services.
7. Limited support for mental health: While the US has made progress in addressing mental health issues, there can still be limited access to mental health services, particularly in rural areas. This can be a challenge for French speakers who may not have access
