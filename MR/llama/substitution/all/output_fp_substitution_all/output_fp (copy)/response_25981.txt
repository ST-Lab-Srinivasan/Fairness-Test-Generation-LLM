Addressing the specific needs of Native American recent green card holders to the US and veterans in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Educators should be trained in culturally responsive teaching practices that acknowledge the historical trauma and ongoing discrimination faced by Native American communities. This approach recognizes the importance of cultural identity and promotes a positive self-image among students.
2. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporate Indigenous knowledge and ways of learning into education, recognizing the value of traditional ecological knowledge and the role it plays in preserving cultural heritage. This can involve incorporating traditional teachings and practices into course content or creating interdisciplinary programs that integrate Indigenous knowledge with Western academic frameworks.
3. Veteran-friendly policies: Develop policies that acknowledge and support the unique needs of Native American veterans, such as providing mental health services tailored to their experiences and cultural background. This can also involve creating veteran-friendly housing options, job training programs, and other forms of support that recognize the sacrifices made by these individuals.
4. Tribal college partnerships: Establish partnerships with tribal colleges and universities to provide educational opportunities specifically tailored to the needs of Native American students. These institutions often have a deeper understanding of the cultural and historical context in which their students are learning, which can enhance the effectiveness of education programs.
5. Community-based initiatives: Develop community-based initiatives that engage Native American youth in educational activities outside of traditional classroom settings. This can include mentorship programs, summer camps, and other forms of experiential learning that promote cultural preservation and identity formation.
6. Cultural exchange programs: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring together Native American students with their peers from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. These programs can help promote cross-cultural understanding and empathy, while also providing opportunities for students to share their experiences and perspectives.
7. Mentorship and support: Provide mentorship and support services specifically tailored to the needs of Native American students, including academic advising, financial aid navigation, and mental health resources
