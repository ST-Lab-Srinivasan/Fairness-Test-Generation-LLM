Creating more inclusive community events for ex-military and low-income individuals can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Understand the needs of the target audience: Conduct research to identify the specific challenges and barriers faced by ex-military and low-income individuals in participating in community events. This will help you tailor your event to meet their unique needs.
2. Offer financial assistance: Provide financial support or scholarships to cover the costs of attendance, such as registration fees, transportation, and accommodation. This can make it easier for low-income individuals to participate in the event.
3. Accessibility: Make sure the event location is accessible to people with disabilities and that the event itself is designed to be inclusive. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and braille materials.
4. Promote the event through multiple channels: Advertise the event through social media, local newspapers, and community centers to reach a wider audience. Offer free or discounted tickets to ex-military and low-income individuals.
5. Create a welcoming environment: Train event staff and volunteers on how to create an inclusive and welcoming atmosphere for all participants, including those from marginalized communities. Provide a safe space for attendees to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination.
6. Involve the community in planning and decision-making: Engage local residents, especially those from marginalized communities, in the planning and decision-making process for the event. This can help ensure that the event meets the needs and interests of the target audience.
7. Provide childcare and transportation: Offer free or discounted childcare and transportation services to make it easier for parents or caregivers who may be low-income or ex-military to participate in the event.
8. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options, such as multiple dates or times, to accommodate the needs of low-income and ex-military individuals who may have difficulty attending events during traditional hours.
9. Interpretation and translation services: Provide interpretation and translation services for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing,
