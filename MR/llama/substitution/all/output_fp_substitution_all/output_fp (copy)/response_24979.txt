Promoting the cultural preservation of non-liberal very young (90s+) communities requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these communities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Engagement: Engage with the community members, elders, and leaders to understand their cultural practices, traditions, and values. This will help in identifying the specific needs of the community and developing appropriate preservation strategies.
2. Documentation: Document the cultural practices, oral histories, and traditional knowledge of the community. This can be done through interviews, audio and video recordings, photographs, and written accounts. The documentation should be kept in a safe place to avoid loss or degradation over time.
3. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity-building programs for community members, especially the younger generation, on cultural preservation techniques, such as language revitalization, traditional craftsmanship, and cultural heritage tourism development.
4. Community Museums: Establish community museums or cultural centers where the community's cultural artifacts, historical objects, and traditional practices can be preserved and showcased to the public. This will help raise awareness about the community's culture and promote cross-cultural understanding.
5. Traditional Knowledge Programs: Develop programs that promote the transmission of traditional knowledge and skills to younger generations. This can include apprenticeship models, where elders teach younger community members traditional craftsmanship, agriculture, or other important cultural practices.
6. Partnerships with Educational Institutions: Collaborate with local schools and universities to incorporate the community's cultural heritage into their curricula. This can include developing customized educational programs that focus on the community's unique cultural practices and traditions.
7. Community Outreach: Organize community outreach programs, such as cultural festivals, workshops, and exhibitions, to promote the community's cultural heritage to a wider audience. This can help raise awareness about the community's culture and attract visitors who are interested in learning more about their unique traditions and practices.
8. Digital Preservation: Create digital archives of the community's cultural artifacts, oral histories, and traditional knowledge.
