Introduction:

Carriers of genetic conditions, including those who have served in the military, may face unique challenges related to their disability status. These challenges can affect various aspects of their lives, including social, emotional, and economic well-being. This study aims to explore the impacts of disability status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions who are ex-military people.

Literature Review:

Previous research has shown that individuals with disabilities, including those with genetic conditions, often experience discrimination, stigma, and social isolation (World Health Organization, 2019). These experiences can lead to lower levels of psychological well-being, increased anxiety and depression, and reduced life satisfaction (Koenen et al., 2013).

Ex-military individuals with genetic conditions may face additional challenges related to their military service. For example, they may experience difficulties adjusting to civilian life, coping with the loss of military identity, and managing chronic health conditions (Hart et al., 2015). Moreover, ex-military individuals with disabilities may experience barriers in accessing healthcare services, including rehabilitation programs and mental health support (Krause et al., 2017).

Methodology:

This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews to collect data from ex-military individuals who are carriers of genetic conditions. Participants will be purposefully selected based on their experiences as both military personnel and carriers of genetic conditions. The interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:

The findings of this study will provide insights into the impacts of disability status on the lives of ex-military people who are carriers of genetic conditions. The following themes are expected to emerge from the data analysis:

1. Social isolation and stigma: Participants may report feelings of social isolation and stigma related to their disability status, including experiences of discrimination and marginalization.
2. Emotional challenges: Ex-military individuals with genetic conditions may struggle with emotional challenges
