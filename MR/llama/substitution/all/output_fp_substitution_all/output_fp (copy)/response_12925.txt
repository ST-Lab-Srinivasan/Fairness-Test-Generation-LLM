As a Nigerian, learning Arabic can be a rewarding and enriching experience, especially for those interested in Islamic studies or business dealings with Arab-speaking countries. However, as a beginner Arabic speaker, there may be some challenges that you could face in the legal system of Nigeria. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: As an Arabic speaker, you may find it difficult to communicate effectively in the legal system of Nigeria, which uses English as its official language. You may struggle to understand legal terminology or express yourself clearly in a language that is not your native tongue.
