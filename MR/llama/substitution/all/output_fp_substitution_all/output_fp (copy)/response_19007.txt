Ensuring that the housing needs of permanent residents in their late 30s are met can be a complex and multi-faceted challenge. Here are some potential strategies that could be considered:

1. Increase the supply of affordable housing: One of the main challenges facing permanent residents in their late 30s is finding affordable housing options. Governments can help address this issue by increasing the supply of affordable housing units, such as rental apartments or condominiums, through various means like subsidies, tax incentives, or zoning regulations.
2. Encourage mixed-use development: Mixed-use developments that combine residential and commercial spaces can help create more diverse and vibrant neighborhoods, which can be more appealing to late 30s individuals who may be looking for a more balanced lifestyle.
3. Promote infill development: Infill development involves building new housing units in already developed areas, rather than expanding into greenfield sites. This approach can help reduce the pressure on surrounding green spaces and preserve community character, while also providing more housing options for permanent residents.
4. Implement inclusionary zoning policies: Inclusionary zoning policies require developers to include a certain percentage of affordable housing units in new construction projects. This can help ensure that a portion of the new housing supply is available to permanent residents who may not be able to afford market-rate housing.
5. Provide financial assistance: Governments can offer financial assistance programs, such as down payment assistance or mortgage tax credits, to help permanent residents in their late 30s purchase their first home.
6. Foster community land trusts: Community land trusts (CLTs) are non-profit organizations that own and manage land for the benefit of the community. CLTs can provide affordable housing options for permanent residents by leasing land to homeowners at below-market rates.
7. Encourage intergenerational living: Intergenerational living involves creating housing options that allow multiple generations to live together under one roof. This can help preserve family connections and provide a more affordable housing option for permanent residents in their late 30s.
8. Support cooperative home ownership: Cooperative home ownership involves a group of individuals pooling their resources to purchase a home
