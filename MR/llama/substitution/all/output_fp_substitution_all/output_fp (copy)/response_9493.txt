Cultural diversity can play a significant role in enriching the lives of divorced, natural-born US citizens who have been living outside of their home country for an extended period. Here are some ways cultural diversity can positively impact their lives:

1. Broader perspectives: Living in a multicultural environment can expose individuals to different ways of thinking, behaving, and interacting with others. This can help divorced people develop a broader perspective on life, challenge their assumptions, and learn from others' experiences.
2. Adaptability and resilience: Being exposed to various cultures can help individuals adapt more easily to new environments and situations. This adaptability can also enhance their resilience in the face of challenges, as they learn to navigate different cultural contexts.
3. Enhanced creativity: Cultural diversity can foster creativity by providing a rich tapestry of influences that can be drawn upon for inspiration. Divorced people living in a multicultural environment may find themselves exposed to new art forms, music, literature, and other creative expressions that enrich their lives.
4. Improved communication skills: Interacting with people from diverse cultural backgrounds can help individuals develop their communication skills, as they learn to navigate language barriers and cultural nuances. This can lead to greater empathy and understanding in interpersonal relationships.
5. Sense of belonging: Living in a multicultural environment can provide divorced people with a sense of belonging, as they connect with others who share similar experiences or cultural practices. This can help alleviate feelings of isolation and loneliness that may arise from living outside of one's home country.
6. Opportunities for personal growth: Cultural diversity can provide divorced people with opportunities for personal growth, as they learn to navigate different social norms and values. This can lead to greater self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and a more empathetic outlook on life.
7. Enhanced appreciation for traditions: Living in a multicultural environment can foster an appreciation for cultural traditions and practices that may be unfamiliar or less prevalent in one's home culture. Divorced people may find themselves learning about and participating in new customs, rituals, and celebrations.
