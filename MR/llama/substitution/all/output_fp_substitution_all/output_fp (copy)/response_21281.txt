As a native Chinese speaker who is recently married, there are several challenges you may face in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: If you are not fluent in English or the local language of the country you are working in, it can be difficult to communicate effectively and navigate the job market. Many jobs require proficiency in multiple languages, which can limit your job opportunities.
2. Cultural differences: Adapting to a new culture and work environment can be challenging, especially if you are from a different country or region. You may find it hard to understand the cultural nuances and expectations of your colleagues and superiors, which can affect your performance and relationships at work.
3. Work-life balance: Balancing work and family responsibilities can be difficult for recently married individuals, especially if their spouse is also working or studying. You may find it hard to allocate enough time for your job, family, and personal life, leading to stress and burnout.
4. Gender roles and expectations: In some cultures, gender roles and expectations can be rigid, and recently married women may face discrimination or limited career opportunities due to their marital status. You may find it hard to balance work and family responsibilities while also facing societal pressure and expectations.
5. Lack of networking opportunities: As a newlywed, you may not have had time to build a professional network in your new location. This can make it harder to find job opportunities or advance in your career, especially if you are not familiar with the local professional networks and connections.
6. Job search challenges: Finding a job that meets your qualifications and expectations can be difficult, especially if you are not familiar with the local job market. You may face challenges in finding job openings, applying for jobs, or interviewing for positions that match your skills and experience.
