Introduction:
Marriage and family are important aspects of life for many individuals, and can have a significant impact on one's well-being and quality of life. However, the impact of marital status on the lives of non-disabled native Chinese speakers has received relatively little attention in research. This study aims to explore the various ways in which marital status can affect the lives of non-disabled native Chinese speakers, including their social relationships, economic stability, mental and physical health, and overall life satisfaction.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can have a significant impact on an individual's well-being, with married individuals reporting higher levels of life satisfaction than single or divorced individuals (DiDonato et al., 2014). However, these findings may not hold true for non-disabled native Chinese speakers.

One potential reason for this is the cultural and social norms surrounding marriage and family in China. Marriage is often seen as a way to secure economic and social stability, rather than as an end in itself (Liu & Zhang, 2015). As such, individuals who are not married may be viewed as being incomplete or unfulfilled, which could have negative impacts on their mental health and overall life satisfaction.

Another factor to consider is the changing nature of marriage and family in China. With the rise of individualism and the decline of traditional gender roles, the institution of marriage is undergoing a transformation (Chen & Zhang, 2016). As a result, the impact of marital status on the lives of non-disabled native Chinese speakers may vary depending on factors such as age, education level, and socioeconomic status.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. The sample will consist of 500 non-disabled native Chinese speakers aged 18-65 years old, recruited through convenience sampling. Participants will complete a survey assessing their marital status, social relationships, economic stability, mental and physical health, and overall life satisfaction. A subsample of participants will also participate in semi-structured interviews to provide more in-depth insights into the impact of marital status on their lives.
