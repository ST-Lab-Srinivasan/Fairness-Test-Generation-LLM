Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of physically disabled long-term recently divorced people. This group faces unique challenges related to their disability, divorce, and immigration status. The purpose of this research is to explore the experiences of this population and identify the specific challenges they face.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that individuals with physical disabilities are more likely to experience social isolation, depression, and anxiety compared to non-disabled populations (Koenig et al., 2014). Long-term divorce can also have a significant impact on mental health, leading to increased stress, anxiety, and depression (Waldron & Hahl, 2016). Additionally, immigration status can affect access to healthcare, social support, and economic opportunities, which can exacerbate existing challenges (Hart et al., 2017).

Methodology:
This research will use a qualitative approach with in-depth interviews to collect data from physically disabled long-term recently divorced people who are also dealing with immigration status issues. Participants will be recruited through community organizations and online support groups. The sample size will be purposefully small to allow for detailed exploration of the participants' experiences.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis, which involves identifying patterns and themes within the data (Braun & Clarke, 2013). The themes that emerge from the data will be organized into categories, and the findings will be presented in a narrative style.

Expected Outcomes:
This research aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the impacts of immigration status on the lives of physically disabled long-term recently divorced people. Specifically, we expect to identify the following themes:

1. Access to healthcare and social support: The participants' experiences with accessing healthcare and social support services will be explored, including any barriers or challenges they face due to their immigration status.
2. Economic opportunities and stability: The participants' experiences with finding employment and maintaining financial stability will be examined, including any impacts of immigration status on these processes.
3. Mental health
