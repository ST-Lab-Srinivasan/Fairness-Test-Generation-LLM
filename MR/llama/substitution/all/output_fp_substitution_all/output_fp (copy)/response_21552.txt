Promoting the educational success of Native American natural-born US citizens can be a complex and multifaceted task. Here are some strategies that have been shown to be effective in promoting educational success among this population:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native American students often face significant cultural barriers in the classroom, including the use of non-Indigenous curricula and instructional methods that do not take into account their cultural backgrounds.
