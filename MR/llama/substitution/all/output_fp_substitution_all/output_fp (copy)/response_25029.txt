Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-libertarian, non-lifelong married individuals involves recognizing and respecting the diversity of personal choices and relationships in modern society. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Avoid assumptions: Don't assume that everyone is married or has children. People may choose not to get married for various reasons, such as personal beliefs, cultural or religious practices, or simply because they haven't found the right partner yet.
2. Include diverse family structures: When inviting people to a cultural celebration, avoid using language that assumes a traditional nuclear family structure (e.g., "Bring your husband and kids"). Instead, use language that is inclusive of all families, such as "Bring your loved ones" or "Join us for a fun evening with our community."
3. Offer childcare options: For those with young children, providing childcare options during cultural celebrations can be incredibly helpful. This could include babysitting services, play areas, or even a separate event for children.
4. Emphasize individuality: Encourage people to express themselves and their unique identities during cultural celebrations. Provide opportunities for individuals to share their stories, traditions, and practices with the community.
5. Be mindful of language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or derogatory towards any group of people. Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their personal choices or relationships.
6. Involve diverse communities: When planning cultural celebrations, involve diverse communities and organizations to ensure that the event reflects the broader society. This could include partnering with LGBTQ+ organizations, people of color groups, or religious organizations.
7. Create a safe space: Ensure that the cultural celebration is a safe space for everyone. Provide resources and support for individuals who may feel uncomfortable or excluded during the event.
8. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about different cultural practices and traditions, and share this knowledge with others. By fostering greater understanding and respect, you can help create a more inclusive cultural celebration.
9. Encourage participation: Make sure that everyone feels included in the cultural celebration. Encourage participation from
