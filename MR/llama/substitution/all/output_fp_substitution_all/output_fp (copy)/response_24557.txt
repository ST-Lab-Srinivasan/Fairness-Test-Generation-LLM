Addressing the needs of deeply lower-class native English speakers in disaster response requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Access: Ensure that communication materials and resources are available in the languages spoken by the target community, including those who may not be fluent in English. Provide interpreters or translated information to facilitate access to services.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be aware of cultural differences and how they may impact response efforts. For example, some communities may have different communication styles or ways of expressing emotions. Be sensitive to these differences and adapt your approach accordingly.
3. Capacity Building: Provide training and resources to help community members develop the skills needed to respond to disasters. This can include emergency preparedness training, first aid training, and other response-related skills.
4. Community Involvement: Involve the community in disaster response efforts by providing opportunities for them to participate in planning, decision-making, and implementation. This can help build trust and increase the chances of successful outcomes.
5. Addressing Power Dynamics: Be aware of power dynamics within the community, particularly those related to race, class, and gender. Take steps to address any inequities or biases that may impact response efforts.
6. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Work with local organizations and groups that are familiar with the community's needs and can provide valuable insight and support. This can help ensure that response efforts are tailored to the community's unique circumstances.
7. Inclusive Communication: Use inclusive language in all communication, including messaging, briefings, and coordination. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to non-native English speakers.
8. Access to Information: Ensure that information is available in a variety of formats and languages to reach a wider audience. Use multiple channels for communication, including print, digital, and social media.
9. Community-Led Response: Encourage community members to take an active role in disaster response efforts. This can help build resilience and reduce the risk of dependence on outside resources.
10. Post-Disaster Support: Provide ongoing support to communities after a disaster has passed, including mental health services, economic development assistance,
