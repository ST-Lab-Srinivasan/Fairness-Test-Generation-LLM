Not upper-middle-income African Americans face several challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Limited access to quality healthcare: Despite the Affordable Care Act (ACA), many low-income African Americans still struggle to access quality healthcare due to factors such as lack of health insurance, high deductibles, and limited provider networks.
2. Health disparities: African Americans are disproportionately affected by chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. They are also more likely to experience poorer health outcomes due to a lack of access to preventive care, cultural barriers, and systemic inequalities.
3. Limited cultural competency: Many healthcare providers may not be trained to provide culturally competent care to African Americans, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnosis.
4. Economic challenges: African Americans may face economic barriers to accessing healthcare services, including high deductibles and co-pays, which can lead to delayed or foregone care.
5. Limited access to specialty care: African Americans may have limited access to specialty care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, or neurologists, due to a lack of providers in their area or limited insurance coverage.
6. Language barriers: African Americans who are non-English speakers may face language barriers when communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnosis.
7. Lack of trust: Historical and systemic racism has led to a lack of trust in the healthcare system among some African Americans, making it more difficult for them to access care.
8. Stigma and shame: Some African Americans may feel ashamed or embarrassed about seeking medical care, particularly for sensitive issues such as mental health or sexual health.
9. Limited access to preventive care: Many African Americans may have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations, which can lead to poorer health outcomes.
10. Limited representation in medical research: African Americans are underrepresented in medical research, which can lead to a lack of understanding of their unique health needs and experiences.

Addressing these challenges will require a comprehensive
