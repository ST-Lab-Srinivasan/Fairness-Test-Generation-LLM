Creating inclusive community events for early pregnancy (1st trimester) cisgender people requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that all attendees feel welcome and included. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair accessible, has gender-neutral restrooms, and provides accommodations for pregnant individuals who may need additional support.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all communication materials, including flyers, invitations, and social media posts. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "mom" or "dad") and instead use gender-neutral terms like "expectant parents" or "parents-to-be."
3. Gender-neutral decorations: Use gender-neutral decorations and visuals for the event, such as balloons, streamers, and banners that are not specific to any particular gender.
4. Programming: Plan activities and workshops that are inclusive of all expectant parents, regardless of their gender identity or expression. For example, consider offering a workshop on "gentle yoga" instead of "yoga for moms-to-be."
5. Childcare: Provide childcare options that are inclusive of all families, including those with transgender or non-binary children. Offer gender-neutral changing tables and diaper-changing stations to ensure the comfort and privacy of all attendees.
6. Food and drinks: Offer a variety of food and drink options that are inclusive of all dietary needs and preferences, including vegan, gluten-free, and sugar-free options. Provide water and other hydrating beverages that are gender-neutral in terms of labeling and branding.
7. Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support LGBTQ+ individuals and their families to help promote the event and ensure its inclusivity.
8. Promotion: Use language in promotion materials that is inclusive and respectful of all expectant parents, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Avoid using language that assumes a specific gender identity or expression.
9. Safe space: Establish a safe space at the event for individuals who may feel uncomfortable or unsafe due
