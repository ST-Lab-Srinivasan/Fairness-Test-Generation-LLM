3. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for beginners to connect with more experienced speakers and native Arabic speakers. This can be done through small group discussions, language exchange programs, or cultural events where beginners can practice their skills in a supportive environment.

6. Create a safe space: Ensure that the celebration is an inclusive and respectful environment for all participants, regardless of their background or level of proficiency in Arabic. Encourage open communication and avoid any language or cultural practices that may be offensive or exclusionary.
7. Involve beginners in planning: Encourage beginners to participate in the planning process by asking for their input on what they would like to see at the celebration. This will help them feel invested in the event and more likely to attend.
8. Provide visual aids: Use visual aids such as posters, videos, or presentations to supplement verbal explanations and make the cultural celebration more accessible to beginners.
