The impact of military service on the lives of native English speakers who are not conservative can vary greatly depending on their individual experiences and circumstances. Here are some potential effects:

1. Personal growth: Military service can be a transformative experience that challenges an individual's beliefs, values, and worldview. Non-conservative individuals may find themselves exposed to new ideas and perspectives that broaden their horizons and help them develop personally.
