As a cultural Hindu, there are several challenges that natural-born Indian citizens may face within the legal system:

1. Lack of representation: Cultural Hindus may find it difficult to find legal representatives who understand and respect their cultural beliefs and practices. This can lead to miscommunication and misunderstandings during legal proceedings.
2. Discrimination: Unfortunately, cultural Hindus may face discrimination within the legal system, particularly if they are not familiar with the legal language and procedures. This can result in unequal treatment under the law.
3. Difficulty in proving religious beliefs: As a cultural Hindu, it may be challenging to prove one's religious beliefs and practices in a legal setting, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the legal system.
4. Conflict between religion and law: In some cases, cultural Hindu beliefs and practices may conflict with the law. For example, some Hindu customs may involve animal sacrifice, which is illegal in many countries. This can create a difficult situation for cultural Hindus who find themselves caught between their religious beliefs and the law.
5. Lack of legal protection: In some cases, cultural Hindus may not have the same legal protections as other religious groups. For example, they may not have the same rights to practice their religion freely or to obtain legal remedies for discrimination based on their religion.
6. Difficulty in navigating religious and legal frameworks: Cultural Hindus may find it challenging to navigate the complexities of both the religious and legal frameworks, particularly if they are not familiar with both. This can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts between the two systems.
7. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on where they live, cultural Hindus may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and legal aid organizations. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
8. Lack of awareness about legal rights: Cultural Hindus may be unaware of their legal rights and protections, which can leave them vulnerable to discrimination and unequal treatment under the law.
9. Difficulty in proving cultural significance: In some cases, cultural Hindus may find it challenging to prove the cultural significance
