Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-liberal physically able-bodied individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and enjoyable for everyone:

1. Accessibility Features: Ensure that the event space is wheelchair-accessible, has ramps or elevators, and provides enough space for mobility aids such as wheelchairs or scooters. Provide audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for visually impaired individuals.
2. Inclusive Programming: Offer a variety of activities that cater to different abilities and interests. For example, provide both seated and standing areas for performances, and offer interactive activities that can be adapted for different abilities.
3. Sensory-Friendly Environments: Create a sensory-friendly environment by minimizing loud noises, bright lights, and strong smells. Provide quiet rooms or areas for individuals who may need a break from the stimulation.
4. Communication Accessibility: Offer multiple ways to access information, such as written materials, audio descriptions, or sign language interpretation. Provide advance notice of any important information or changes in the event schedule.
5. Inclusive Marketing: Use inclusive language and imagery in promotional materials to ensure that all individuals feel welcome and included. Highlight the accessibility features and accommodations provided at the event.
6. Staff Training: Provide training for event staff and volunteers on disability etiquette, accessibility, and how to assist individuals with different abilities. This can help create a more inclusive and welcoming environment.
7. Collaboration with Disability Organizations: Partner with local disability organizations to gain insight into the needs of non-liberal physically able-bodied individuals and to leverage their expertise in creating an accessible event.
8. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish a feedback mechanism for attendees to provide input on the accessibility of the event. Use this feedback to make improvements for future events.
9. Flexibility: Offer flexible options for seating, performances, and activities to accommodate different abilities and needs. For example, provide both fixed and portable seating options, or offer adaptive instruments for musicians with disabilities
