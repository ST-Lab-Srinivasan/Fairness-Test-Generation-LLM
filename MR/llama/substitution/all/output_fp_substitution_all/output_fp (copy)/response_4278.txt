Creating more inclusive public spaces for extreme ultra-independent native Arabic speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach to design and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will allow for greater participation from individuals who may have mobility impairments.

3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural sensitivities and practices when designing and programming public spaces. For example, ensure that the space is free from any visual or auditory stimuli that may be offensive or disruptive to individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds.
4. Flexible Spaces: Create flexible spaces that can accommodate a variety of activities and uses, such as quiet areas for independent work or group spaces for collaborative activities. This will allow individuals with different preferences and needs to feel comfortable and included in the space.
5. Technology Access: Ensure that technology is accessible and inclusive, such as providing adaptive devices for individuals with disabilities or offering multilingual interfaces for language support.
6. Inclusive Programming: Develop programming that caters to a diverse range of interests and needs, such as offering classes or workshops on topics relevant to extreme ultra-independent native Arabic speakers. This could include topics like independent living skills, financial management, or cultural enrichment activities.
