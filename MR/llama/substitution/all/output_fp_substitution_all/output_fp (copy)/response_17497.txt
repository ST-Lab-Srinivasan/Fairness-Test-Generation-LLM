5. Promote events through social media and local organizations: Use social media platforms and collaborate with local organizations that cater to beginner English speakers to promote your events. This will help reach a wider audience and ensure that the events are well-attended by people from diverse backgrounds.
6. Offer cultural activities: Incorporate cultural activities, such as traditional music, dance, or art, into your events to create an immersive experience for beginner English speakers. This will help them feel more connected to their new community and promote cultural understanding.
