The financial stability of non-married multiple times temporary visa holders and recent undocumented immigrants in the US can be promoted through a combination of policies and interventions. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Access to Financial Services: Provide access to basic banking services, such as checkable savings accounts and debit cards, to help individuals manage their finances and build credit. This can be achieved through partnerships with financial institutions or the development of innovative financial products.
2. Financial Literacy and Capacity Building: Offer financial education programs and resources to help individuals understand basic financial concepts, manage debt, and make informed financial decisions. This can include workshops, webinars, and one-on-one coaching.
3. Income Support: Provide temporary cash assistance or vouchers for essential expenses, such as food, housing, and healthcare, to help individuals stabilize their finances during the transition from undocumented to legal status.
4. Tax Filing Assistance: Offer free or low-cost tax filing services to help individuals claim tax credits and refunds they are eligible for, which can help them build credit and save money.
5. Emergency Savings Programs: Develop emergency savings programs that provide matched savings incentives or interest-free loans to help individuals build a safety net for unexpected expenses.
6. Employment Training and Placement Services: Offer job training and placement services to help individuals gain the skills they need to compete in the US labor market, which can lead to higher earning potential and financial stability.
7. Microfinance Programs: Provide small loans or other forms of microfinance to help individuals start or grow a business, which can help them build credit and generate income.
8. Public Benefits Access: Help individuals access public benefits, such as Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which can provide essential healthcare and food security.
9. Housing Stability Programs: Offer rental assistance or housing counseling services to help individuals find affordable housing, avoid eviction, and build a stable living situation.
