As a teacher, there are several strategies you can use to ensure that the educational needs of beginner French speakers are met:

1. Assess their level: Before starting the course, assess the students' prior knowledge and experience with the French language. This will help you identify their strengths and weaknesses, and tailor your teaching approach accordingly.
2. Use a variety of teaching methods: Use a combination of interactive and traditional teaching methods to engage students and help them learn effectively. For example, you could use multimedia resources such as videos, audio recordings, and online exercises, along with more traditional teaching methods like lectures, discussions, and written assignments.
3. Provide opportunities for practice: Encourage students to practice their French language skills through regular speaking and listening activities. This could include role-playing exercises, group discussions, and individual presentations.
4. Use authentic materials: Incorporate authentic materials such as news articles, videos, and music into your teaching to help students learn about France and the French-speaking world in a more meaningful way.
5. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: Pair beginner students with more advanced students who can act as language partners and mentors. This will give beginners an opportunity to practice their skills in a supportive environment.
6. Offer additional resources: Provide students with additional resources such as language learning apps, online courses, and language exchange websites to help them continue learning outside of the classroom.
7. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt your teaching approach based on the needs and preferences of your students. Every student learns differently, so it's important to be flexible and accommodating in your teaching style.
8. Use formative assessments: Regularly assess students' progress throughout the course using formative assessments such as quizzes, class discussions, and peer evaluations. This will help you identify areas where students may need additional support or practice.
9. Provide feedback: Provide regular feedback to students on their language use, both orally and in writing. This will help them understand their strengths and weaknesses, and identify areas for improvement.
10. Encourage student autonomy: Encourage students to take ownership of their learning by setting goals and tracking their progress throughout the course. This
