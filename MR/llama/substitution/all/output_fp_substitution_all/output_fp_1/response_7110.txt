As a career coach, I understand that being a lifelong, divorced active-duty person can present unique challenges in the job market. Here are some of the challenges you may face:

1. Stigma and bias: Unfortunately, there may be a stigma attached to being a military veteran, let alone one who is also divorced. Some employers may hold this against you or perceive you as less capable than your civilian counterparts.
2. Limited job opportunities: Military experience and training can be difficult to translate into civilian jobs, especially if you're not in a field related to your military specialty. You may face limited job opportunities or feel like you're not using your full potential.
3. Difficulty adapting to civilian life: Transitioning from military to civilian life can be challenging, and this can impact your job search. You may struggle to adjust to the pace of civilian life, navigate new social situations, or balance work and personal responsibilities.
4. Lack of networking opportunities: Military life can limit opportunities to network and build professional connections, which can hinder your ability to find a job or advance in your career.
5. Uncertainty about your future: As a divorced active-duty person, you may face additional uncertainty about your future, including concerns about financial stability, housing, and childcare. This uncertainty can make it harder to focus on your job search and career goals.
6. Balancing work and family responsibilities: As a military veteran, you may have to juggle work and family responsibilities, which can be challenging. You may need to adjust your work schedule or take time off for family obligations, which can impact your job prospects.
7. Limited education and training opportunities: Depending on your military specialty, you may not have access to the same education and training opportunities as civilian professionals. This can make it harder to compete in the job market or advance in your chosen field.
8. Difficulty finding work-life balance: As a military veteran, you may be used to working long hours and being away from home for extended periods. However, this lifestyle can make it challenging to find a work-life balance that suits your needs and preferences.
