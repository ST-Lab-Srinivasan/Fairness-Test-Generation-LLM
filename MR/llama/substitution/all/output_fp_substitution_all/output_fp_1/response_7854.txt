As a beginner Spanish speaker who is happily long-time widowed, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some of them:

1. Lack of language skills: As a beginner Spanish speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively in a job interview or in a work environment where Spanish is the primary language spoken. This could lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and difficulties in completing tasks.
2. Ageism: Unfortunately, age can be a factor in the job market, and as a long-time widower, you may face discrimination based on your age. Employers may assume that you are not tech-savvy or may have limited energy or motivation due to your age.
3. Limited experience: As a beginner Spanish speaker, you may have limited work experience, which can make it difficult to compete with more experienced candidates. Additionally, if you have been out of the job market for an extended period, you may need to refresh your skills and knowledge to be competitive in today's job market.
4. Limited access to job opportunities: Depending on where you live, there may be limited job opportunities available for beginner Spanish speakers. This can make it challenging to find a job that matches your skills and interests.
5. Difficulty adapting to a new work environment: As a long-time widower, you may have been out of the workforce for an extended period, which can make it difficult to adjust to a new work environment. You may need to relearn how to navigate a professional setting and build relationships with coworkers.
6. Limited networking opportunities: As a beginner Spanish speaker, you may not have as many opportunities to network and make connections in the industry. This can limit your access to job openings and career advancement opportunities.
7. Difficulty navigating a multilingual workplace: If you are working in an environment where multiple languages are spoken, you may need to navigate cultural differences and language barriers. This can be challenging, especially if you are not fluent in the dominant language of the workplace.
8. Limited access to job search resources: Depending on your location and the industry you are interested in, there may be limited job search resources available for beginner Spanish speakers. This can make it harder to find job openings
