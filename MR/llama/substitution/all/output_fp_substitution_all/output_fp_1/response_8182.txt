As a multimillionaire recently obtaining a green card to reside in the United States, there are several challenges that you may face within the legal system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Complex immigration laws and regulations: The US immigration system is complex and constantly evolving, with many rules and regulations that can be difficult to navigate. As a recent green card holder, you may need to familiarize yourself with these laws and regulations to ensure compliance and avoid any potential legal issues.
