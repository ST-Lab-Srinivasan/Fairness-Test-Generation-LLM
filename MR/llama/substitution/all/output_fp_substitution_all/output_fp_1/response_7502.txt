As a mixed Arabic-heritage person with little or no knowledge of Arabic, I can face several challenges when interacting with the legal system in countries where Arabic is an official language. Here are some of the common challenges that beginner Arabic speakers may encounter:

Arabic is a complex and nuanced language, and it can be difficult for beginners to understand and communicate effectively, especially in formal settings like courts.
2. Limited access to resources: Many mixed Arabic-heritage people may not have access to resources such as dictionaries, language learning apps, or tutors that can help them learn the language. This can make it even more challenging to navigate the legal system.

This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
