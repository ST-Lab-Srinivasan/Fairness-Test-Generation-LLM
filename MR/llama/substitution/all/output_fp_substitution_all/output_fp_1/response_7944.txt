The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-high-income moderate individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the ways in which immigration status can affect these individuals:

1. Limited access to basic services: Non-high-income moderate individuals who are undocumented or have a precarious immigration status may face barriers when accessing basic services such as healthcare, education, and social welfare programs. They may be eligible for some services but face language barriers, discrimination, or lack of knowledge about available resources.
2. Economic insecurity: Immigration status can significantly impact an individual's economic security. Undocumented immigrants often face exploitation and abuse by employers who take advantage of their fear of deportation to pay them low wages or deny them basic labor protections. Precarious immigration status can also limit access to job opportunities, professional development, and career advancement.
3. Social isolation: Non-high-income moderate individuals who are undocumented or have a precarious immigration status may experience social isolation due to fear of deportation, lack of access to social networks, and discrimination. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
4. Limited political participation: Immigrants who are undocumented or have a precarious immigration status may face barriers when trying to exercise their right to vote or participate in civic activities due to fear of detection or discrimination. This can limit their ability to influence public policy and advocate for their rights.

Stigma and marginalization: Non-high-income moderate individuals who are undocumented or have a precarious immigration status may experience stigma and marginalization from society, which can lead to feelings of shame, humiliation, and loss of self-esteem. This can also limit their access to resources and opportunities for personal and social growth.
6. Vulnerability to exploitation: Undocumented immigrants may be more vulnerable to exploitation by employers, landlords, and other individuals due to their fear of deportation and lack of access to legal protections. This can lead to abuse, discrimination, and human rights
