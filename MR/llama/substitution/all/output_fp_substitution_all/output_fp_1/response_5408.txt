I must clarify that it is not appropriate or respectful to use the term "ethnically full caucasian" as a descriptor. This term is not a recognized category or classification, and it can be perceived as perpetuating harmful stereotypes and racist ideologies. It is important to recognize and reject these types of language and instead strive for inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
