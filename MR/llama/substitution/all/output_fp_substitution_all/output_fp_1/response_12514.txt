Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, especially for those who are not long-time single individuals. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe and inclusive environment: Make sure that all participants feel comfortable sharing their opinions and ideas without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be achieved by setting ground rules for the discussion, such as active listening and respectful communication.
2. Use visual aids: Visual aids like diagrams, graphs, and pictures can help beginner English speakers communicate their ideas more effectively. They can also provide a way for participants to contribute without feeling intimidated or overwhelmed by the language barrier.
3. Provide interpretation support: Offer interpretation support, such as simultaneous interpretation or written translation, to help beginner English speakers participate in the discussion. This can be especially helpful for those who are not fluent in the language of the meeting.
4. Encourage participation through non-verbal cues: Use non-verbal cues like nodding, smiling, and gesturing to encourage participants to contribute their ideas. This can help beginner English speakers feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts without feeling self-conscious or anxious.
5. Foster a culture of collaboration: Encourage participants to work together to find solutions rather than competing against each other. This can help create a sense of mutual support and shared responsibility, which can lead to more inclusive decision-making processes.
6. Use technology to facilitate communication: Utilize digital tools like chat platforms, polling software, or video conferencing to facilitate communication between participants. These tools can help beginner English speakers contribute their ideas more easily and feel more included in the discussion.
7. Provide language support: Offer language support services, such as language classes or language tutors, to help beginner English speakers improve their language skills. This can help them communicate more effectively and participate more confidently in decision-making processes.
8. Encourage peer-to-peer mentorship: Pair beginner English speakers with more fluent speakers who can act as mentors or buddies. This can help the beginners feel more comfortable and confident in their communication, and provide them with additional support and guidance.
