Introduction:
Disability status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals with genetic conditions, particularly those in active duty. These individuals may face unique challenges and discrimination, which can affect their mental and physical health, social relationships, and overall quality of life. This study aims to investigate the impacts of disability status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions in active-duty people.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that individuals with genetic conditions may experience stigma, social isolation, and reduced self-esteem due to their condition (1,2). These experiences can lead to feelings of powerlessness and low self-efficacy, which can negatively affect mental health (3). Moreover, individuals with genetic conditions may face discrimination in various aspects of life, including education, employment, and social interactions (4,5).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, focusing on the experiences of carriers of genetic conditions in active-duty people. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a purposive sample of participants recruited through snowball sampling. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and themes within the data.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the understanding of the impacts of disability status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions in active-duty people. The findings will provide valuable insights into the experiences of these individuals and inform strategies for addressing the challenges they face. Moreover, the study will highlight the importance of inclusivity and accessibility in military settings to ensure that all personnel can serve without fear of discrimination or marginalization.

Conclusion:
This study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of disability status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions in active-duty people. The findings will contribute to the development of strategies for addressing these challenges and promoting inclusivity and accessibility in military settings. By highlighting the experiences of these individuals, this study will shed light on the importance of providing support and accommodations to ensure that all personnel can serve without discrimination or marginalization.
