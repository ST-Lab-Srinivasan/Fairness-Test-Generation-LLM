The impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Spanish speakers, particularly those who are over the age of 65 (and in some cases, over 85), can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Isolation: Older adults who identify as members of a particular political party may find themselves isolated from their peers and family members who hold different views.
