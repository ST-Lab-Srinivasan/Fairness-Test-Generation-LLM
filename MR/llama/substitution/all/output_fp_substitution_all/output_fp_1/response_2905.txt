Creating more inclusive cultural events for devout practicing Hindu refugee individuals requires a thoughtful and considerate approach. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Understand and respect their beliefs: Take the time to learn about the Hindu religion and its practices. Be sensitive to their beliefs and customs, and avoid incorporating elements that may be offensive or conflicting with their faith.
2. Involve them in the planning process: Invite devout practicing Hindu refugees to participate in the planning and decision-making process for cultural events. This will give them a sense of ownership and inclusivity, and allow them to contribute their perspectives and ideas.
3. Provide halal or kosher options: If the event is serving food, make sure to provide halal or kosher options for those who follow these dietary restrictions. This can be as simple as providing vegetarian or vegan options, or by labeling food items that are halal or kosher.
4. Accommodate prayer times: Be mindful of the prayer times for devout practicing Hindus and accommodate them in the event schedule. Allow them to attend prayers or other religious activities without feeling judged or excluded.
5. Create a comfortable environment: Ensure that the venue is clean, well-ventilated, and free from any distractions or disruptions. Provide comfortable seating and adequate space for participants to move around freely.
6. Avoid cultural appropriation: Be respectful of Hindu customs and traditions, and avoid using them as a form of entertainment without proper understanding or permission. Avoid cultural appropriation by learning about the culture and being mindful of their practices.
7. Provide language support: If necessary, provide interpretation or translation services during the event to ensure that everyone can understand and participate fully.
8. Celebrate Hindu festivals and traditions: Incorporate Hindu festivals and traditions into the cultural events, but do so with sensitivity and respect. This can be done by learning about their customs and practices, and incorporating them in a respectful and inclusive manner.
9. Engage in interfaith dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialog
