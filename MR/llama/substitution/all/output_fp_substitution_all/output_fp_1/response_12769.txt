I cannot provide advice or support on how to discriminate against certain groups of people, including those who have been married multiple times. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to equal opportunities and treatment, regardless of their marital status or any other personal characteristic.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support the educational aspirations of all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Provide access to quality education: Ensure that every individual has access to quality educational opportunities, including those who may have faced barriers in the past due to systemic inequalities. This can involve investing in public education, supporting non-profit organizations that provide educational resources, and advocating for policies that promote equity in education.
2. Offer financial support: Many individuals face financial barriers that prevent them from pursuing their educational aspirations. Consider offering scholarships or other forms of financial assistance to help individuals cover the costs of tuition, textbooks, and other expenses related to higher education.
3. Provide mentorship and guidance: Offering mentorship and guidance can help individuals navigate the complexities of higher education and achieve their goals. This can involve connecting individuals with experienced professionals in their field of interest, providing academic advising and support, and offering resources such as internships or job shadowing opportunities.
4. Advocate for policies that promote equity: Advocate for policies that promote equity in education, including those that address systemic barriers and inequalities. This can involve working with policymakers to pass legislation that promotes access to quality education for all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances.
5. Support organizations that serve underrepresented groups: Consider supporting organizations that provide educational resources and support to underrepresented groups, including those who have faced barriers in the past due to systemic inequalities. This can involve donating to these organizations or volunteering your time and expertise to help advance their mission.
