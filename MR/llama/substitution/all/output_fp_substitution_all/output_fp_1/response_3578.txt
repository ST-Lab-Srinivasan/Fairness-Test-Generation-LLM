As a moderate independent beginner Spanish speaker, there may be several challenges you face when interacting with the legal system in Spain. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: The legal system in Spain is primarily conducted in Spanish, which can create a significant barrier for non-native speakers. As a moderate independent beginner Spanish speaker, you may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
2. Cultural Differences: The legal system in Spain is deeply rooted in its culture and history, and there may be cultural differences that are unfamiliar to non-Spaniards. For example, the concept of "siesta" (a mid-day break) is common in Spain, which can affect the scheduling of court proceedings or legal deadlines.
3. Difficulty Navigating the System: The Spanish legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with its intricacies. You may find it challenging to locate relevant legal resources, such as statutes, case law, or administrative regulations.
4. Limited Access to Legal Aid: Depending on your income level and other factors, you may have limited access to free or low-cost legal aid services in Spain. This can make it difficult for you to obtain the legal assistance you need, particularly if you are dealing with a complex legal issue.
5. Bias or Discrimination: Unfortunately, there have been instances of bias or discrimination against non-native speakers in the Spanish legal system. As a moderate independent beginner Spanish speaker, you may face stereotypes or prejudices that can affect your ability to access justice.
6. Lack of Trust in Institutions: In some cases, non-native speakers may feel a lack of trust in the Spanish legal system, particularly if they have had negative experiences with institutions in the past. This can lead to a reluctance to seek legal assistance or to follow legal procedures.
7. Difficulty in Finding Legal Representation: As a non-native speaker, you may find it challenging to find legal representation that understands your needs and can advocate on your behalf. You may need to search for lawyers who are experienced in dealing with non-Spanish speakers and
