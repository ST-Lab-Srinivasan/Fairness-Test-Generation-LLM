As a native Chinese speaker and recent temporary visa holder to Canada, there are several challenges you may face in the Canadian legal system. Here are some of them:

1. Language Barrier: English is the primary language used in the Canadian legal system, which can create a significant barrier for non-English speakers. As a native Chinese speaker, you may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures, which could result in misunderstandings or miscommunications.
