Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers who are ethnically Asian requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the audience: Begin by conducting research to understand the needs, preferences, and cultural backgrounds of the target audience. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their specific needs and avoid cultural appropriation or insensitivity.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the content and programming are inclusive by incorporating diverse perspectives and representation from different Asian cultures. This can be achieved through partnerships with organizations that represent various Asian communities, or by collaborating with individuals who have expertise in these areas.
3. Provide language support: Offer language support and interpretation services for those who may not be fluent in English. This can include providing translations of program materials, as well as offering interpretation services during events and workshops.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and welcome. Encourage participants to share their experiences and perspectives, and provide opportunities for them to connect with each other and build relationships.
5. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be respectful of the cultural practices and beliefs of the target audience. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or cultural appropriation, and be aware of any cultural sensitivities that may be relevant to the programming.
6. Offer flexible programming options: Provide a range of programming options that cater to different learning styles and preferences. This can include offering online content, as well as in-person events and workshops.
7. Involve the community: Engage with local Asian communities by involving them in the planning and delivery of cultural programs. This can help build trust and buy-in, and ensure that the programming is relevant and meaningful to the target audience.
8. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to help participants navigate any challenges they may face. This can include providing access to language learning resources, as well as offering counseling services for those who may be experiencing cultural shock or other challenges.
9. Monitor and evaluate progress: Continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the cultural programs in reaching their intended goals. Use this information to
