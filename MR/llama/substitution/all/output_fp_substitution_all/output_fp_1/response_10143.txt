Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of non-nominal Christian individuals, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can influence an individual's identity:

These traditions can shape an individual's identity by providing a sense of belonging and connection to their community and cultural roots.
