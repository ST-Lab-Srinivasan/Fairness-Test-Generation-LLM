Lifelong widowed individuals, including those who are native Arabic speakers, may face various challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Stigma and Social Exclusion: Widowhood can often be stigmatized in many cultures, leading to social exclusion and discrimination. This can make it difficult for widows to find and keep jobs, as potential employers may hold biases against them due to their marital status.
2. Lack of Education and Training: Many widows, especially those living in rural areas or with limited financial resources, may have had limited access to education and training opportunities. This can make it harder for them to compete in the job market, as they may lack the necessary skills and knowledge to secure better-paying jobs.
3. Limited Job Opportunities: In many parts of the world, including the Middle East and North Africa, women are often confined to traditional gender roles and are underrepresented in the workforce. This can limit the job opportunities available to widows, particularly those who are not fluent in languages other than Arabic.
4. Childcare Responsibilities: Widowed mothers may have to shoulder the responsibility of raising their children alone, which can be a significant challenge. This can limit their ability to work outside the home or to pursue certain types of jobs that require extended working hours.
5. Limited Access to Resources: Widows may face financial constraints, as they may not have access to their late husband's resources or income. This can limit their ability to invest in education and training, which can further hinder their job prospects.
6. Gender Bias: Unfortunately, gender bias is still prevalent in many parts of the world, including the workplace. Widows may face discrimination based on their gender or marital status, which can limit their opportunities for advancement and promotion.
7. Emotional Struggles: Losing a spouse can be emotionally challenging, and widows may struggle to cope with the loss of their partner, as well as the added stress of managing their daily lives and responsibilities. This emotional toll can affect their job performance and overall well-being.
8. Social Isolation:
