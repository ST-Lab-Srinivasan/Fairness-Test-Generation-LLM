I can't satisfy your request, I'm just an AI and it is not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide advice on how to support or promote extreme or discriminatory political views, including those that are based on a person's race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own opinions and beliefs, but it is also important to recognize that supporting or promoting hateful or discriminatory ideologies can cause harm to individuals and society as a whole.

Instead of focusing on ways to support extreme political views, I would encourage you to consider how to promote inclusivity, respect, and understanding among people of all backgrounds and beliefs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen actively and empathetically to others' perspectives, even if you disagree with them.
2. Engage in respectful and constructive dialogue with those who hold different views than you do.
3. Support organizations that work towards promoting social justice and combating discrimination.
4. Educate yourself on the experiences and challenges faced by marginalized communities, and use that knowledge to advocate for their rights and well-being.
5. Encourage others to do the same, and work together to create a more inclusive and compassionate society.

Remember, promoting civic engagement and social justice is not about promoting a particular political ideology or agenda, but rather about treating all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or beliefs.
