The impact of immigration status on the lives of autistic individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy can be significant, as it can affect their access to healthcare and other services. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Autistic individuals who are undocumented or have temporary immigration status may face barriers when seeking medical care, including prenatal care, due to fear of deportation or lack of insurance coverage. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby's health.
