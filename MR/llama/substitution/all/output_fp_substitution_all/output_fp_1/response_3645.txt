1. Improved communication: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent can communicate effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds. This is particularly important for native Arabic speakers, as language barriers can hinder communication and lead to misunderstandings. Culturally competent healthcare providers can use interpreters or provide written materials in Arabic to facilitate communication.
