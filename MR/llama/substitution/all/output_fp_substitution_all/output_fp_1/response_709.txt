2. Affordable housing options: Develop and promote affordable housing options that cater to the needs of lower-income individuals, including those from marginalized communities. This can involve partnering with non-profit organizations, community groups, and local governments to create affordable housing units.
3. Accessible design: Ensure that housing units are designed to be accessible and inclusive for individuals with disabilities, regardless of their religious beliefs. This can involve incorporating features such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and adaptable bathroom and kitchen designs.

5. Education and awareness: Educate the public about the importance of inclusive and equitable housing policies, and promote awareness about the rights of marginalized communities. This can involve organizing workshops, creating educational materials, and promoting media campaigns that highlight the need for inclusive housing policies.
