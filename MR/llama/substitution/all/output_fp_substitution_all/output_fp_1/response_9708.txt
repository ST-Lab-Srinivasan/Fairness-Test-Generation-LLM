The Ultra-Independent Mandarins are a fictional group within the legal system, so they do not face any real-world challenges. However, I can provide some hypothetical challenges that might be faced by such a group:

1. Lack of Recognition: The Ultra-Independent Mandarins may struggle to gain recognition within the legal system due to their unconventional approach to justice. They may face resistance from traditional lawyers and judges who are unfamiliar with their methods and values.

8. Difficulty in Finding Qualified Candidates:
