As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the term "Mandarin" is not a recognized ethnic or racial group in the United States. The US Census Bureau recognizes only two Chinese ethnic groups: Asian and Asian American. Therefore, the term "Mandarin undocumented natural-born US citizen people" does not accurately reflect any specific ethnic or racial group.

However, I understand that you are asking about the legal challenges faced by some individuals who may be of Chinese descent but are not recognized as a specific ethnic or racial group in the legal system.

There are several challenges that undocumented immigrants, including those of Chinese descent, may face in the legal system:

1. Lack of legal representation: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers to accessing legal representation due to their immigration status. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the complexities of the legal system and access the resources they need.
2. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against undocumented immigrants, including those of Chinese descent, is prevalent in the US legal system. This can result in unequal treatment under the law and make it more difficult for these individuals to access justice.
3. Complexity of immigration laws: The US immigration laws are complex and constantly changing, which can make it difficult for undocumented immigrants to understand their rights and obligations. This can lead to confusion and errors that can have serious consequences.
4. Fear of deportation: Many undocumented immigrants live in constant fear of deportation, which can prevent them from accessing legal services or seeking justice through the legal system.
5. Limited access to social services: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers to accessing social services, such as healthcare and education, due to their immigration status. This can make it difficult for them to access the resources they need to thrive and overcome challenges.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not limited to any one ethnic or racial group, but rather affect many undocumented immigrants in the US. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the unique needs and experiences of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
