Ensuring the voices of refugees with unknown genetic conditions are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to improve their representation and inclusion:

1. Capacity building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for refugees with unknown genetic conditions to develop their skills and knowledge in areas such as advocacy, leadership, and policy development. This will enable them to effectively participate in decision-making processes.
2. Community outreach and engagement: Engage with refugee communities to raise awareness about the importance of inclusive decision-making processes and encourage their participation. This can be done through community outreach programs, focus groups, and other forms of engagement.
3. Partnership with civil society organizations: Collaborate with civil society organizations that work with refugees to amplify their voices and ensure they are represented in decision-making processes. These organizations can provide valuable support and resources to help refugees participate effectively.
4. Inclusive consultation processes: Ensure that consultation processes are inclusive and accessible to all, including those with unknown genetic conditions. This can be achieved by providing accommodations such as interpreters, note-takers, and flexible communication methods.
5. Use of technology: Leverage technology to enable remote participation in decision-making processes, such as through video conferencing or online surveys. This can help ensure that refugees with unknown genetic conditions who may face barriers to in-person participation are still able to contribute their voices.
6. Advocacy and awareness-raising: Raise awareness about the importance of including the voices of refugees with unknown genetic conditions in decision-making processes. This can be done through advocacy campaigns, media outreach, and other forms of public education.
7. Policy and legal frameworks: Advocate for policies and legal frameworks that promote the inclusion of refugees with unknown genetic conditions in decision-making processes. This can involve working with governments, international organizations, and other stakeholders to develop and implement inclusive policies.
8. Community mobilization: Mobilize communities of refugees with unknown genetic conditions to advocate for their rights and participation in decision-making processes. This can involve organizing community events, protests, and other forms of collective
