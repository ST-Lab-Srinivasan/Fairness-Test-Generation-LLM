According to various studies and reports, older Mexican adults (those aged 65 and older) face several challenges within the healthcare system. These challenges are particularly relevant for those over the age of 90, who may have more complex health needs and face additional barriers in accessing care. Some of the key challenges faced by elderly Mexican people in the healthcare system include:

1. Access to care: Older adults in Mexico may encounter difficulties in accessing healthcare services due to various factors such as geographic isolation, lack of transportation, and limited financial resources. This can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can negatively impact their health outcomes.
