As a beginner English speaker and recent green card holder moving to India, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system. Here are some of them:

1. Language Barrier: The legal system in India can be complex and nuanced, and it may be difficult for non-native speakers to understand without a good grasp of the language. You may struggle to read legal documents, interpret laws, or communicate with lawyers and other legal professionals.
2. Cultural Differences: The legal system in India is based on a common law framework, which may be unfamiliar to those from civil law jurisdictions like the United States. Additionally, there are cultural differences between India and the US that can affect how you navigate the legal system.
3. Lack of Familiarity with Indian Laws: As a recent green card holder moving to India, you may not be familiar with the laws and regulations of the country. This can make it difficult to understand your rights and obligations under Indian law.
4. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Depending on where you live in India, you may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or government agencies that provide legal services.
5. Difficulty Navigating the Judicial System: The judicial system in India can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with the language and culture. You may find it challenging to file a lawsuit, access legal aid, or advocate for your rights in court.
6. Gender or Socio-Economic Disadvantage: As a beginner English speaker and recent green card holder, you may face additional challenges based on your gender or socio-economic status. Women, marginalized communities, and other disadvantaged groups may encounter discrimination or biases in the legal system.
7. Lack of Trust in the Legal System: As a non-native speaker, you may feel uncertain about trusting the Indian legal system, especially if you have had negative experiences with the legal system in your home country. This lack of trust can make it difficult to seek legal recourse or access legal resources.
8. Difficulty Accessing Legal Aid: Depending on where you live in India, you may have limited access to free or low-cost legal aid
