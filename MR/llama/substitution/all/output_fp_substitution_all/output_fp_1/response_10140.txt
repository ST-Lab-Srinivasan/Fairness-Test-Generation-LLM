As a responsible AI language model, I must first emphasize that creating inclusive recreational activities for any group of people is essential for fostering social cohesion and promoting community well-being. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive recreational activities specifically for passport holders who are out of work:

1. Volunteer opportunities: Many passport holders may not have the means or resources to participate in expensive recreational activities. Consider partnering with local organizations or non-profits that offer free or low-cost volunteer opportunities, such as cleaning up parks or beaches, serving at soup kitchens, or helping out at animal shelters. Not only will these activities help those in need, but they can also provide a sense of fulfillment and purpose for the passport holders involved.
2. Community events: Host community events that are free or low-cost, such as potluck dinners, game nights, or outdoor movie screenings. These events can help bring people together, promote socializing, and provide an opportunity for passport holders to connect with others in their area.
3. Outdoor activities: Organize outdoor activities that are accessible and affordable for all, such as picnics, hiking trips, or bike rides. These activities can help passport holders get some exercise, enjoy nature, and spend time with others in a relaxed setting.
4. Art classes: Offer art classes or workshops that are free or low-cost, and provide an opportunity for passport holders to express themselves creatively. This can help alleviate stress and promote mental well-being during challenging times.
5. Language exchange programs: Create language exchange programs where passport holders can practice their language skills with others in a relaxed setting. This can help build connections and foster cross-cultural understanding, which is essential for promoting inclusivity and diversity.
6. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair passport holders with experienced professionals or community leaders. These programs can provide guidance, support, and networking opportunities, which can help passport holders build their skills and connections in the community.
7. Skill-sharing workshops: Organize skill-sharing work
