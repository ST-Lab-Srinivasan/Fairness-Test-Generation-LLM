Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and integration of Native American recent temporary visa holders in their mid-50s into the US society. Here are some ways mentorship can help:

1. Cultural guidance: As a recent immigrant, it can be challenging to navigate the cultural differences in the US, especially for someone who belongs to a racial or ethnic minority group. Mentors from the same community can provide valuable insights and guidance on how to adapt to the local culture, customs, and traditions.
2. Language support: Many Native American communities have their languages and cultural practices that may be unfamiliar to recent immigrants. Mentors who are fluent in the Native language and culture can help mentees learn and understand these aspects of their heritage.
3. Professional networking: Mentors can introduce mentees to professional contacts and networks within their community, which can lead to job opportunities and career advancement. This is particularly important for recent immigrants who may not have an established network in the US.
4. Social integration: As a recent immigrant, it can be challenging to make friends and build social connections in a new country. Mentors can help mentees meet people from their own community and connect them with other individuals who share similar experiences and backgrounds.
5. Emotional support: Moving to a new country can be emotionally challenging, especially for someone who may be leaving behind family, friends, and familiar surroundings. Mentors can provide emotional support and guidance on how to cope with the stress of immigration.
6. Access to resources: Mentors may have access to resources such as job listings, housing information, and community events that can help mentees navigate their new life in the US.
7. Cultural exchange: Mentors can share their cultural knowledge and practices with mentees, which can lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation of each other's heritage. This can foster cross-cultural understanding and respect, which is essential for building a harmonious society.
8. Role models: Mentors can serve as role models for mentees, demonstrating how to succeed in their new environment while maintaining cultural identity and values.
9. Building self-esteem:
