As a native English speaker and a natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that I have encountered in the legal system. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. Language Barriers: As a non-native English speaker, I have faced language barriers in the legal system. Many legal documents, such as contracts and court proceedings, are written in English, which can be challenging for me to understand fully.
