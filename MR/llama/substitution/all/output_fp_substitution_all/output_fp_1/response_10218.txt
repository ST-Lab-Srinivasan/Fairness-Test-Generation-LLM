As an AI language model, I cannot provide personalized advice or advocate for any particular group's needs. However, I can provide some general information on the types of support systems that may be important for active-duty Native American natural-born US citizens.

Active-duty military personnel, including those who are Native American, often face unique challenges related to their service and cultural identity. Here are some support systems that may be particularly important for these individuals:

1. Military Support Services: The US military offers various support services, such as counseling, financial assistance, and educational resources, which can be helpful for active-duty personnel and their families. These services can address the emotional, psychological, and financial challenges associated with military service.
2. Native American Cultural Resources: Many Native American tribes have cultural resources and organizations that provide support to members of their communities, including veterans. These resources may include language and cultural classes, traditional healing practices, and community events.
3. Veteran Organizations: There are several organizations that serve the needs of veterans, including those from Native American communities. Examples include the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, and Veterans of Foreign Wars. These organizations may provide financial assistance, advocacy services, and social support to veterans and their families.
4. Mental Health Services: Military service can take a toll on mental health, particularly for those who have experienced combat trauma or other stressful situations. Native American individuals may face additional cultural and historical trauma that can impact their mental health. Accessing mental health services through the military or civilian providers can help address these challenges.
5. Family Support: Military service can be challenging for family members, particularly those who are responsible for caring for loved ones while the service member is deployed. Building a strong support network of family and friends can help alleviate some of the stress associated with military life.
6. Community Resources: Native American communities may have their own unique resources and programs designed to support veterans and their families. These resources could include cultural events, spiritual healing services, or community-based social support networks.
7. Advocacy Organizations: There are several advocacy organizations that serve the interests of Native American veterans, including the National Congress of American Indians, the Native American Veterans Association
