1. Language Support: Provide language support and resources for those who are struggling with English, such as interpreters, translators, or language classes. This will help level the playing field and ensure that all voices are heard.
2. Inclusive Decision-Making Processes: Create decision-making processes that are inclusive and accessible to everyone. Use techniques like consensus-building, collaborative problem-solving, and participatory governance. This can involve creating spaces for dialogue and discussion where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.

5. Building Trust: Build trust by being consistent, reliable, and transparent in your interactions. This can involve following through on commitments, being open and honest about decision-making processes, and avoiding actions that could undermine the trust and confidence of marginalized groups.

This can involve workshops, training sessions, or other educational programs that promote cultural competence and inclusivity.
