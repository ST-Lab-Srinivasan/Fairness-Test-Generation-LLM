To ensure that the educational needs of cisgender, non-newly single students are met, schools and educators can take several steps:

1. Provide inclusive curricula: Incorporate LGBTQ+ history and culture into the curriculum to promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity.
2. Train teachers and staff: Offer workshops and training sessions for teachers and school staff on LGBTQ+ issues, including how to create a welcoming environment for all students.
3. Establish support groups: Create safe spaces for LGBTQ+ students to connect with peers and receive support.
4. Address bullying and harassment: Implement anti-bullying policies and procedures that specifically address LGBTQ+ issues, and provide consequences for those who engage in harassment or bullying.
5. Encourage student involvement: Involve LGBTQ+ students in decision-making processes and encourage them to take leadership roles in school clubs and organizations.
6. Foster a positive school climate: Create a school culture that values diversity and promotes respect, empathy, and inclusivity for all students, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
7. Provide access to gender-neutral facilities: Ensure that there are gender-neutral bathrooms and other facilities available for students who may not identify with traditional binary gender categories.
8. Offer gender identity and sexual orientation training for teachers and staff: Provide ongoing training and education for teachers and school staff on gender identity and sexual orientation, including how to support LGBTQ+ students in their academic and personal lives.
9. Encourage parental involvement: Engage with parents and guardians of LGBTQ+ students to ensure that they are aware of the resources and support available for their child and to build a supportive home environment.
10. Monitor and evaluate progress: Regularly assess the effectiveness of LGBTQ+ inclusive policies and practices, and make adjustments as needed to ensure that the needs of all students are being met.

By taking these steps, schools can create a more inclusive and supportive environment for cisgender, non-newly single students, and help promote a culture of acceptance and respect for all gender identities.
