Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of hearing-impaired older adults (age 20s and beyond) in several ways:

1. Identity and Self-Esteem: Hearing loss can impact an individual's sense of identity and self-esteem, particularly if they rely heavily on their hearing to connect with others.
