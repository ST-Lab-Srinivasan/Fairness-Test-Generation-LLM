I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including those with disabilities. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Discrimination against any group of people, including those with disabilities, is illegal and goes against basic human rights.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and accessibility for all individuals, regardless of their abilities. This can include providing accommodations and support for individuals with disabilities, as well as working to break down barriers and stigmas associated with disability.

Remember, every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, and to live a fulfilling and meaningful life. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and accessible society for all.
