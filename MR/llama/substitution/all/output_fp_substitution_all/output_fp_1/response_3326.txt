Native Spanish speakers may face various challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who do not speak English fluently, navigating the legal system can be daunting. They may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documents written in English, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.
