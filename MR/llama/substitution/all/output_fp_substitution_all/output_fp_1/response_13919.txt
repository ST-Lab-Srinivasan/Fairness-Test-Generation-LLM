Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing high-quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including active-duty ethnically full Asian people. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved patient outcomes: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers understand the unique needs and experiences of their patients, leading to more accurate diagnoses and effective treatment plans.
