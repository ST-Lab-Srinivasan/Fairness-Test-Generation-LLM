As a native Arabic speaker, there are several challenges that you may face in the healthcare system at the age of 65. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: Depending on where you live and the availability of healthcare providers who speak Arabic, you may encounter language barriers when communicating with healthcare professionals. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about your medical history, treatment options, and other important information.
