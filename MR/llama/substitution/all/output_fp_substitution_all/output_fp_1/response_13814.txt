As a temporary visa holder in India in your late 30s, you may face several challenges in accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the common difficulties you may encounter:

1. Language barriers: India has a diverse population with many languages spoken throughout the country. As a non-native English speaker, you may find it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers, especially if they are not fluent in your native language.
2. Lack of familiarity with Indian healthcare system: The Indian healthcare system can be complex and confusing, especially for foreigners who are not familiar with the culture and practices. You may struggle to navigate the system, find the right providers, or understand the treatment options available.
3. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on your medical condition, you may find that India does not have the necessary specialized care or equipment to provide adequate treatment. This can be particularly challenging if you require complex surgeries or procedures that are not readily available in India.
4. Cost constraints: Healthcare in India can be expensive, especially for foreigners who may not have access to affordable insurance options. You may find it difficult to afford the costs of medical treatment, including hospital stays, medication, and consultations.
5. Cultural differences: India has a unique cultural environment that may differ significantly from what you are used to in your home country. For example, the concept of privacy and personal space can be different in India, which may affect how comfortable you feel discussing your health concerns with providers.
6. Difficulty in finding the right provider: With so many healthcare providers in India, it can be challenging to find the right one who speaks your language, has experience treating patients like you, and is familiar with your medical condition.
7. Limited access to advanced diagnostic tools: Depending on where you are in India, you may not have access to advanced diagnostic tools such as MRI or CT scanners, which can limit the accuracy of diagnoses.

9. Limited access to mental health services: Mental health services are still developing
