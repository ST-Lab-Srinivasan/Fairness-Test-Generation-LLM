Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular Jewish employed individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the needs and interests of the target audience: Conduct research to identify the specific cultural practices and traditions that are important to secular Jewish employees. This could include interviews, surveys, or focus groups to gather feedback and insights.
2. Offer a variety of programs: Develop a range of cultural programs that cater to different interests and needs. For example, offer events that celebrate Jewish holidays and traditions, provide opportunities for learning and growth, or simply offer spaces for socializing and community building.

This could involve offering flexible scheduling options, virtual events, or childcare services to make participation easier for those with busy schedules or families.
4. Involve diverse leadership: Ensure that the planning and execution of cultural programs involve a diversity of voices and perspectives. This could include collaborating with Jewish community leaders, religious leaders, or employee resource groups to ensure that programs are inclusive and representative of the broader Jewish community.

This could include classes on Jewish history, literature, music, or art, as well as workshops on topics such as Shabbat observance, kosher cooking, or Hebrew language learning.
6. Foster a sense of belonging: Create programs that foster a sense of belonging and connection among employees. This could involve hosting events that celebrate Jewish identity and culture, offering opportunities for employees to share their own cultural practices and traditions, or simply creating spaces where employees can connect with one another on a personal level.
