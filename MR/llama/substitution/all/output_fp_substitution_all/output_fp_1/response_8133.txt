As a non-conservative temporary visa holder and recent refugee to the US, there are several challenges that you may face when accessing the healthcare system in the US. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barriers: Many refugees and immigrants may not speak English fluently, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system, especially when dealing with complex medical issues or navigating billing and insurance processes.
2. Lack of knowledge about the healthcare system: Newly arrived refugees and immigrants may be unfamiliar with the US healthcare system and its various components, such as insurance options, medical providers, and hospital services.
3. Limited access to healthcare providers: Refugees and immigrants may face barriers in accessing healthcare providers due to language barriers, cultural differences, or lack of knowledge about the healthcare system.
4. Difficulty navigating billing and insurance processes: Refugees and immigrants may struggle with understanding their insurance options, how to pay for medical services, and how to navigate complex billing and insurance processes.
5. Limited access to specialized care: Refugees and immigrants may face barriers in accessing specialized medical care, such as mental health services or pediatric care, due to language barriers or lack of knowledge about the healthcare system.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Refugees and immigrants may experience stigma and discrimination when seeking medical care, which can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
7. Lack of cultural sensitivity: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the cultural beliefs and practices of refugees and immigrants, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact medical care.
8. Limited access to preventive care: Refugees and immigrants may have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations, which can lead to health disparities and poor health outcomes.
