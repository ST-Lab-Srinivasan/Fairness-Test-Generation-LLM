Addressing the Needs of Long-Term Recently Divorced Ultra-Independent Individuals in Disaster Response: A Review and Recommendations

Introduction:
Long-term recently divorced ultra-independent individuals often face unique challenges in disaster response situations. These individuals may have struggled with the loss of their social support network, financial independence, and emotional stability following a divorce. Disasters can exacerbate these challenges, making it essential to tailor disaster response strategies to address their specific needs. This paper reviews existing literature on this topic and provides recommendations for disaster responders to better serve long-term recently divorced ultra-independent individuals.

Review of the Literature:
Research has shown that long-term recently divorced individuals face several challenges during disaster response situations, including:

1. Lack of social support: Divorce can lead to a loss of social connections and support networks, making it harder for individuals to cope with the stress of a disaster.
2. Financial instability: Divorce often results in financial uncertainty, leaving individuals more vulnerable to economic shocks caused by disasters.
3. Emotional distress: The emotional impact of divorce can make it harder for individuals to manage their emotions during a disaster, leading to increased anxiety and stress.
4. Independence: Long-term recently divorced individuals may have developed a strong sense of independence, which can make it challenging for them to accept help from others during a disaster.
5. Stigma: Some long-term recently divorced individuals may feel stigmatized or ashamed about their marital status, leading to reluctance to seek assistance.

Recommendations for Disaster Responders:
Based on the review of the literature, we recommend the following strategies to better serve long-term recently divorced ultra-independent individuals in disaster response situations:

1. Establish a safe space: Provide a designated area where individuals can seek refuge and feel comfortable expressing their emotions without fear of judgment or stigma.
2. Offer flexible assistance: Be prepared to adapt assistance to the unique needs of each individual, taking into account their level of independence and financial stability.
