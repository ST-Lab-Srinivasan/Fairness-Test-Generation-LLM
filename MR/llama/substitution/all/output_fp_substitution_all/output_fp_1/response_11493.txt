Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native English-speaking progressive people for several reasons:

1. Sense of identity: Cultural heritage helps individuals develop a sense of identity and belonging to a particular group or community. For progressive people, their cultural heritage may be an important aspect of their self-concept and personal identity.
2. Connection to the past: Cultural heritage provides a connection to the past and a way to understand one's history and cultural roots. This can help individuals appreciate their cultural background and understand how it has shaped their beliefs, values, and practices.
3. Shared values and beliefs: Cultural heritage often represents a set of shared values, beliefs, and practices that are important to a group or community. For progressive people, these shared values may include social justice, equality, and human rights, which are central to their worldview.
4. Community building: Cultural heritage can help build a sense of community among individuals who share the same cultural background. This can be particularly important for progressive people who may feel marginalized or isolated in larger society.
5. Resistance and activism: Cultural heritage can also serve as a source of inspiration and resistance for progressive people. By drawing on their cultural heritage, individuals can challenge dominant narratives and power structures, and advocate for social change.
6. Intersectionality: For progressive people who are part of multiple marginalized groups (e.g., racial/ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQ+), their cultural heritage may be intersectional, representing a complex interplay of different identities and experiences.
7. Cultural exchange: Cultural heritage can also facilitate cultural exchange and learning between different groups or communities. For progressive people, this can involve sharing knowledge, practices, and traditions with others, while also learning from them.
8. Preservation and conservation: Finally, cultural heritage plays a crucial role in preserving and conserving the cultural diversity of society. Progressive people may be involved in efforts to protect and preserve their cultural heritage, whether through traditional arts and crafts, historical preservation, or community-based initiatives.

In summary, cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native English-speaking progressive people by providing a sense of identity,
