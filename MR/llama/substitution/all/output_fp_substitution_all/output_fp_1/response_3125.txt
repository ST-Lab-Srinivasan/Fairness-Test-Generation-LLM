Ensuring that the housing needs of Native American recent temporary visa holders in the US are met can be a complex and multifaceted issue. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented:

1. Collaboration with tribal governments and organizations: Working closely with tribal governments and organizations can help ensure that housing needs are met while also respecting the cultural and traditional practices of Native American communities.
2. Culturally sensitive design: When designing housing, it is important to consider the cultural and historical context of Native American communities. This can involve incorporating traditional designs and materials into the housing, as well as ensuring that the housing is accessible and functional for community members.
3. Community land trusts: Community land trusts (CLTs) are a model of affordable home ownership that can help ensure that housing remains affordable and available to low-income community members. CLTs allow community members to purchase homes at below-market prices, while also providing a mechanism for the community to maintain control over the land and housing.
4. Inclusionary zoning: Inclusionary zoning policies require developers to include a certain percentage of affordable housing units in new construction projects. This can help ensure that a portion of the housing stock is available at below-market prices, which can be particularly important for low-income community members.

This can involve providing training and technical assistance, as well as investing in infrastructure and staffing.
