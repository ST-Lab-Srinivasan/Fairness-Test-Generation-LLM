Addressing the specific needs of beginner Arabic speakers and native Spanish speakers in healthcare requires a tailored approach to communication. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Use visual aids: Beginner Arabic speakers may struggle with verbal communication, so using visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos can help convey information more effectively. Native Spanish speakers may also benefit from visual aids, especially if they are not fluent in Arabic.
2. Provide written materials: Offering written materials such as leaflets, brochures, or handouts in both Arabic and Spanish can help beginners understand the information better. This is particularly useful for native Spanish speakers who may be more comfortable reading than listening to spoken communication.
