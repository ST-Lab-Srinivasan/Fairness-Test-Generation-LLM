Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Not Lifelong Divorced Beginner French Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who are not lifelong divorced beginner French speakers. This group includes individuals who have learned French as a second language, either through immersion or formal education, and may identify with multiple cultures and communities. In this paper, we will explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and how they navigate complex issues of identity, belonging, and self-expression.

Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society.
