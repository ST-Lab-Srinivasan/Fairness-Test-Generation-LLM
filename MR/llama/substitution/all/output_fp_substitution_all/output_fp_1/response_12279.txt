Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who are not recently divorced beginner Spanish speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society, which are transmitted from one generation to the next. In this response, we will explore how cultural heritage shapes the identities of individuals, including those who are not recently divorced beginner Spanish speakers, and how it influences their language learning experiences.
