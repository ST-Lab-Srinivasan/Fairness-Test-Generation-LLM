As a Native American and a natural-born US citizen, I understand the importance of creating inclusive public policies that address the unique needs of indigenous communities when it comes to mental health. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for healthcare providers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to help them understand the historical trauma and ongoing discrimination faced by indigenous communities. This will enable them to provide culturally sensitive care and tailor policies to meet the specific needs of these communities.
2. Community-Led Policies: Involve indigenous communities in the policy-making process through community-led initiatives. This can include creating indigenous-led organizations, funding community-based projects, and providing resources for capacity-building. By involving communities in the policymaking process, you can ensure that policies are responsive to their needs and priorities.
3. Traditional Healing Practices: Recognize and respect traditional healing practices within indigenous communities. This includes incorporating these practices into mental health services, such as using traditional healers and ceremonies in conjunction with Western-style therapy. By acknowledging the importance of traditional healing practices, you can help individuals feel more connected to their cultural heritage and better address the root causes of mental health issues.
4. Addressing Systemic Racism: Identify and address systemic racism within mental health systems, such as inadequate funding, lack of culturally competent services, and discrimination faced by indigenous individuals in these systems. This can involve advocating for increased funding for indigenous-led organizations, promoting cultural safety training for healthcare providers, and addressing instances of discrimination within mental health systems.
5. Language Access: Provide language access services to ensure that individuals who speak indigenous languages have equal access to mental health services. This can involve providing interpreters and translators, as well as developing materials in indigenous languages. By making sure that language barriers are not a barrier to accessing mental health care, you can help ensure that all individuals have an equal opportunity to receive the care they need.
6. Collaboration with Indigenous Organizations: Work
