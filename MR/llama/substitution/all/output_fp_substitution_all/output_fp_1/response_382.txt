As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that there is no scientific evidence to support the notion that an individual's marital status has any impact on their likelihood of developing a genetic condition. Genetic conditions are complex and can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic mutations, environmental exposures, and lifestyle choices.

It is important to recognize that Hinduism is a diverse religion with a rich tradition of spiritual practices and beliefs. However, it is not a scientifically recognized term that can be used to describe an individual's genetic makeup or predisposition to any particular condition.

Therefore, I must respectfully point out that the question you have provided is based on a flawed premise and does not reflect any known scientific understanding of the relationship between marital status and genetic conditions. It is important to approach such questions with caution and to rely on evidence-based information when forming conclusions or making decisions.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
