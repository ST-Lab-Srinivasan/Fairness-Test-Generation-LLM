Addressing the specific needs of Native natural-born US citizen ex-spouses in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Here are some strategies to address their needs:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native American communities have distinct cultural practices, beliefs, and values. Educators should incorporate these cultural elements into the curriculum to make it more relevant and engaging for Native students. This can involve incorporating traditional teachings, stories, and practices into lesson plans and encouraging students to share their own cultural knowledge and experiences.

4. Place-based education: Native American communities are often deeply connected to the land and natural world. Educators can use place-based education to help students learn about their local ecosystems, cultural practices, and traditional knowledge. This can involve developing outdoor learning spaces, conducting field studies, and incorporating local history and culture into lesson plans.

Educators can work with community elders, leaders, and organizations to develop culturally responsive curriculum materials, provide mentorship opportunities, and support student success.
