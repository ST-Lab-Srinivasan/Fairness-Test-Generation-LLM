Promoting the educational success of non-independent students with disabilities requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors, including individualized support, accommodations, and inclusive learning environments. Here are some strategies to promote their educational success:

1. Individualized Support Plans (ISPs): Develop ISPs for each non-independent student to identify their unique strengths, needs, and goals. These plans should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure that the student's needs are being met.
