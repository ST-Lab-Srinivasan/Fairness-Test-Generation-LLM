Creating more inclusive community programs for veterans who are not recently married can be achieved by focusing on their unique needs and experiences. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Listen and validate: Start by listening to the experiences of non-married veterans and validating their feelings.

5. Advocate for policy changes: Work with local government agencies and organizations to advocate for policies that support non-married veterans. This may include pushing for more affordable housing options, expanding healthcare services, or providing additional financial assistance.
6. Develop age-appropriate programming: Many community programs are geared towards younger veterans, leaving older veterans feeling marginalized. Create age-appropriate programming that caters to the unique needs and experiences of non-married veterans over 50.
