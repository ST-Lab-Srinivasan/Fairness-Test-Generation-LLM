Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of documented green card holders who are recent refugees to the United States. Here are some ways in which cultural diversity can enhance their experiences:

1. Cultural exchange and learning: As refugees settle in the US, they bring with them their unique cultural practices, beliefs, and values.
