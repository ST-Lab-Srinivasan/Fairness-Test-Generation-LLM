In the context of the legal system, ethnically full African-American people may face a number of challenges, including:

1. Implicit bias: Research has shown that implicit biases can influence the decisions made by legal professionals, including judges, lawyers, and law enforcement officers. These biases can result in unequal treatment under the law for individuals from marginalized communities.
2. Lack of representation: Historically, the legal profession has been dominated by white men, leading to a lack of representation for people of color. This can result in a lack of understanding of the unique experiences and challenges faced by these communities, which can impact the way they are treated within the legal system.
3. Racial profiling: Ethnically full African-American people may be subject to racial profiling by law enforcement officers, which can lead to unnecessary arrests and detentions. This can also result in a lack of trust between these communities and law enforcement agencies.
4. Disparities in sentencing: Research has shown that there are significant disparities in sentencing outcomes for people of color compared to white individuals. This can result in harsher sentences for crimes committed by individuals from marginalized communities.
5. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The legal system may not always take into account the cultural background and experiences of ethnically full African-American people, which can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of their behaviors and actions.
6. Limited access to resources: Ethnically full African-American people may have limited access to legal resources, including attorneys, legal aid organizations, and other forms of support. This can result in a lack of representation and unequal treatment under the law.
7. Historical trauma: The legacy of slavery, segregation, and systemic racism has resulted in historical trauma for many ethnically full African-American people. This trauma can impact their experiences within the legal system
