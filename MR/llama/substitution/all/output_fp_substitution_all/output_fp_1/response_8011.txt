Financially disadvantaged Mexican individuals may face a variety of challenges when interacting with the legal system. Some of the main difficulties include:

2. Difficulty navigating complex legal procedures: The legal system in Mexico can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with the process. Financially disadvantaged individuals may struggle to understand the legal language and procedures, making it harder for them to advocate for themselves.
