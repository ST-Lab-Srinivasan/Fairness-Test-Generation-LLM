Low-income Native natural-born US citizen individuals face significant challenges within the US healthcare system. Some of the challenges include:

1. Limited access to care: Many low-income Native individuals live in rural or remote areas with limited access to healthcare facilities, specialists, and emergency services. This can result in delayed or missed diagnoses, exacerbating existing health issues.
2. Cultural barriers: Native American communities have unique cultural practices and beliefs that may not align with the traditional Western medical model. Healthcare providers may need to be culturally sensitive and adapt their approach to address these differences.
3. Language barriers: Many low-income Native individuals may not speak English fluently, which can create a communication barrier between them and their healthcare providers.
4. Discrimination and stigma: Low-income Native individuals may experience discrimination and stigma within the healthcare system, which can lead to mistrust and reluctance to seek care.
5. Financial barriers: Low-income Native individuals may face financial barriers to accessing healthcare services, including high deductibles, co-pays, and medication costs.
6. Lack of health education: Many low-income Native individuals may lack access to health education resources, which can contribute to poor health outcomes.
7. Limited health insurance coverage: Low-income Native individuals may have limited access to health insurance, which can limit their ability to access preventive care and specialist services.
8. Mental health challenges: Low-income Native individuals may face unique mental health challenges, such as historical trauma, substance abuse, and suicide ideation, which can be difficult to address within the existing healthcare system.
9. Health disparities: Low-income Native individuals may experience health disparities due to a lack of culturally sensitive and evidence-based care, which can exacerbate existing health issues.
10. Limited access to specialist care: Low-income Native individuals may have limited access to specialist care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, or neurologists, due to the lack of these specialists in their area or the inability to afford their services.
