The Nigerian healthcare system faces significant challenges in meeting the needs of the country's upper class population. Here are some potential strategies for ensuring that the healthcare needs of Nigerian upper-class people are met:

1. Increase access to private healthcare facilities: One way to ensure that the healthcare needs of Nigeria's upper class are met is to increase access to private healthcare facilities. This can be achieved by building more private hospitals and clinics, particularly in urban areas where the wealthier population resides.
2. Improve the quality of public healthcare: While increasing access to private healthcare is important, it is equally crucial to improve the quality of public healthcare. This can be done by investing in infrastructure, training more healthcare professionals, and providing better equipment and supplies.
3. Provide subsidies for healthcare: The government can provide subsidies for healthcare services, particularly for those who cannot afford it. This can help make healthcare more accessible to the upper class population.
