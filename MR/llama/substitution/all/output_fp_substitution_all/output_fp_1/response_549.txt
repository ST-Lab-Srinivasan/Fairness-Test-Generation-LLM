The term "non-liberal" is often associated with conservative or traditional values, and it is important to recognize that these individuals may have different cultural backgrounds, beliefs, and practices that can affect their needs during a disaster response. Here are some ways to address the needs of non-liberal individuals in disaster response:

1. Cultural sensitivity: It is essential to be culturally sensitive when responding to the needs of non-liberal individuals. This means being aware of their cultural beliefs and practices, and respecting them during the response process. For example, in some cultures, it is important to maintain social distance or avoid direct eye contact, which can affect how responders interact with affected individuals.
2. Community involvement: Involving local communities in disaster response can help build trust and promote cultural sensitivity. Non-liberal communities may be more likely to accept help from responders who are familiar with their culture and customs. This can involve working with community leaders or traditional authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
3. Religious accommodation: In some cultures, religious beliefs and practices play a significant role in disaster response. Responders should be sensitive to these beliefs and practices, such as providing halal or kosher food options, or allowing individuals to perform religious rituals during the response process.
4. Language barriers: Non-liberal communities may have different languages spoken within them, and responders may need to accommodate this by providing interpreters or translators to facilitate communication. This can help build trust and ensure that the needs of non-liberal individuals are being met.
5. Traditional knowledge: In some cultures, traditional knowledge and practices can be valuable in disaster response. Responders should be open to learning from these communities and incorporating traditional knowledge into their response efforts. For example, indigenous communities may have traditional fire management practices that can help reduce the risk of wildfires during a drought.
6. Gender considerations: Non-liberal societies often have different gender roles and expectations, which can affect how individuals respond to disasters. Responders should be aware of these gender dynamics and ensure that both men and women are included in the response process. This can involve providing separate spaces for women and girls during displacement, or ensuring
