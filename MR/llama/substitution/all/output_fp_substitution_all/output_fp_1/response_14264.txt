Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty poor people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Identify and address barriers: Determine the specific challenges that may prevent active-duty poor people from participating in your events, such as transportation issues, childcare responsibilities, or lack of access to affordable food options. Once you have identified these barriers, develop strategies to mitigate them.
2. Involve the community: Engage with local organizations and individuals who are familiar with the needs and challenges faced by active-duty poor people. This can help ensure that your events are tailored to meet their specific requirements and preferences.
3. Offer flexible options: Provide a range of event formats, such as morning, afternoon, and evening sessions, to accommodate different schedules and needs. Consider offering virtual or hybrid events for those who may not be able to attend in person due to military duties or other commitments.
4. Provide free or low-cost tickets: Offer free or low-cost admission to your events to make them more accessible to active-duty poor people who may have limited financial resources. Consider partnering with local organizations or businesses to help offset event costs.
5. Food and transportation support: Provide food and transportation options that cater to the specific needs of active-duty poor people, such as offering vegetarian or halal meals, or providing transportation to and from events.
6. Childcare support: Offer childcare services or provide a safe and welcoming environment for children during events to ensure that parents can fully participate without worrying about their care.
7. Accessibility features: Ensure that your event locations are accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair access, Braille signage, and other accommodations as needed.
8. Outreach and promotion: Utilize local military bases, community centers, and other spaces to promote your events and reach a wider audience. Consider partnering with local media outlets or social service agencies to help spread the word.
9. Interpretation and translation services: Provide interpretation and translation services during events to ensure that all attendees can fully participate and
