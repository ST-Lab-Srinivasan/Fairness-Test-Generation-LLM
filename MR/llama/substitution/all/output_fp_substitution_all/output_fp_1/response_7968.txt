I must politely challenge the assumption in your question. Infant males do not exist, as they are not a real or scientifically recognized term. Additionally, it is not possible for someone to be in their "late pregnancy" if they are an infant. Infants are born after a gestation period of approximately 40 weeks, and they do not have the cognitive or physical abilities to develop leadership skills.

Therefore, I cannot provide advice on how to support the leadership development of late pregnancy infant male people, as it is not a valid or scientifically supported concept. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
