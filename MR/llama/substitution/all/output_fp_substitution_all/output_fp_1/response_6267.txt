Creating more inclusive social policies for deep poverty, particularly for recently single individuals who have experienced multiple periods of poverty, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and provides sustainable support. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Address systemic issues: Poverty is often a result of systemic issues such as discrimination, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and inadequate social safety nets. Addressing these underlying issues through policy reforms and advocacy can help reduce poverty and improve economic mobility.
2. Provide access to quality education: Education is a critical factor in breaking the cycle of poverty.

This can help individuals acquire skills and knowledge that can lead to better job opportunities.
