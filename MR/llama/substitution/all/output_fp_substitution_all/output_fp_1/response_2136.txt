As a responsible and compassionate AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, should receive the same level of quality care and respect. Here are some ways to ensure that the healthcare needs of strictly fully LGBTQ advanced elderly people (those over 85) are met:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on LGBTQ cultural competency for healthcare providers, focusing on issues specific to aging LGBTQ individuals. This will help ensure that caregivers are aware of the unique challenges and concerns faced by this population.
2. Inclusive Care: Design healthcare settings and services that are inclusive and welcoming to all, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. This may involve implementing policies and procedures that promote respect and dignity for LGBTQ individuals.
3. Access to Care: Ensure that LGBTQ elderly individuals have access to quality healthcare services, including preventive care, chronic disease management, and end-of-life care. This may involve addressing any barriers or discrimination that may exist in accessing healthcare.
4. Supportive Networks: Encourage the development of supportive networks within LGBTQ communities, particularly among elderly individuals. These networks can provide emotional support, advocacy, and practical help with daily tasks, reducing feelings of isolation and improving overall well-being.
5. Age-Appropriate Care: Recognize that LGBTQ elderly individuals have the same age-related health needs as non-LGBTQ peers. Ensure that their care is tailored to their individual needs, taking into account their sexual orientation or gender identity.
6. Palliative Care: Provide palliative care services that are sensitive to the unique needs and concerns of LGBTQ elderly individuals, including those related to their identity and relationships.
7. Advocacy and Support: Advocate for policies and programs that support the health and well-being of LGBTQ elderly individuals, such as affordable housing, transportation, and social services. This can help reduce barriers to accessing healthcare and other essential services.
8. Education and Outreach: Offer educational resources and outreach initiatives that
