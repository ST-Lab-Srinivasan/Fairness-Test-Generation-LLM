Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native French speakers who are ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more inclusive:

1. Acknowledge and address power imbalances: Recognize that the dominant culture in France has historically marginalized and excluded non-white communities, including ethnically full Asian individuals. Address these power imbalances by actively seeking out diverse perspectives and voices in the planning and execution of cultural programs.
2. Incorporate diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural programs include a diverse range of performers, artists, and speakers who reflect the richness of French-Asian culture. This can be achieved by actively seeking out talented individuals from underrepresented groups and providing opportunities for them to showcase their skills.
3. Foster inclusive spaces: Create spaces where ethnically full Asian individuals feel welcome and included. This can be done by providing interpreters or bilingual staff during events, offering translation services, and ensuring that marketing materials are available in multiple languages.
4. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide training for staff and volunteers on cultural sensitivity and inclusivity to help them better understand and address the needs of ethnically full Asian individuals. This can include learning about the history and experiences of these communities, as well as developing empathy and understanding.
5. Engage with the community: Build relationships with ethnically full Asian communities by engaging in ongoing dialogue and listening to their concerns. This can help identify areas where cultural programs can be improved and make them more inclusive.
6. Provide accessibility measures: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to ethnically full Asian individuals with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.
7. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diversity of French-Asian culture by showcasing a range of traditions, customs, and practices. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity for ethnically full Asian individuals.
8. Encourage intercultural dialogue: Facilitate intercultural dialogue between different communities by organizing events that bring people together and encourage sharing of experiences
