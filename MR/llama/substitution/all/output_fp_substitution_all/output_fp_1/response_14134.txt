Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Beginner French Speaker Green Card Holders as Natural-Born US Citizens

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identity and experiences of individuals, including those who are beginner French speakers and green card holders. As natural-born US citizens, these individuals may have diverse cultural backgrounds and heritages that intersect with their American identity. This study aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in the lives of beginner French speaker green card holders as natural-born US citizens.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have highlighted the importance of cultural heritage in shaping individual identities and experiences. For instance, scholars have found that cultural heritage can influence an individual's language learning motivation and proficiency (Grosjean & DeGraff, 2017). Additionally, research has shown that cultural heritage can impact an individual's sense of belonging and identity (Hood, 2015). However, there is a lack of research specifically focused on the role of cultural heritage in the lives of beginner French speakers and green card holders as natural-born US citizens.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from a purposive sample of beginner French speakers who are also green card holders and natural-born US citizens. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and social media advertisements. The interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be employed to identify patterns and themes in the data.

Expected Findings:
This study aims to answer the following research questions:

1. How do beginner French speakers and green card holders as natural-born US citizens experience and express their cultural heritage?
2. How does cultural heritage intersect with their American identity, language learning motivation, and proficiency?
3. What are the implications of these intersections for their sense of belonging and identity in the United States?

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the complex ways in which cultural heritage influences individual identities and experiences, particularly among beginner French speakers
