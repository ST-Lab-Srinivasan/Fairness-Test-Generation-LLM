Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and integration of Native American recent refugees in the United States, particularly for those who are over the age of 65 (and therefore approaching retirement or already retired). Here are some ways mentorship can help:

A mentor can introduce them to local organizations, community events, and other resources that can enhance their quality of life.
3. Networking opportunities: Mentors can provide access to their professional networks, which can help recent refugees learn about job opportunities, expand their social circles, and build relationships with potential employers or clients.
