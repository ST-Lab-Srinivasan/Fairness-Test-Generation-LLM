The inclusion of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who have been divorced for a long time and marginalized, is crucial to ensure that diverse perspectives are represented in decision-making processes. Here are some strategies to amplify their voices:

1. Language classes and resources: Provide free or low-cost Arabic language classes specifically designed for beginners, including those who have been divorced for a long time. Offer materials that cater to different learning styles and abilities. This will help individuals improve their language skills and become more confident in expressing themselves.
2. Community outreach and partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations that serve marginalized communities, including those who have been divorced for a long time. Partner with community centers, mosques, churches, and other religious institutions to reach a broader audience. Leverage these partnerships to provide access to decision-making processes.
3. Capacity building workshops: Organize workshops on effective communication, leadership, and advocacy skills specifically designed for beginner Arabic speakers. These workshops can help individuals build their confidence and develop the skills necessary to participate in decision-making processes.
4. Online platforms and resources: Create online spaces where beginner Arabic speakers can connect, share experiences, and access information on decision-making processes. This could include virtual language exchange programs, social media groups, or online forums dedicated to discussing issues related to marginalized communities.
5. Interpretation and translation services: Provide interpretation and translation services during community events, workshops, and decision-making meetings to ensure that beginner Arabic speakers can fully participate. This could involve hiring professional interpreters or utilizing technology such as remote interpretation software.
6. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that connect experienced individuals from marginalized communities with beginner Arabic speakers. This can help provide guidance, support, and role models for those looking to participate in decision-making processes.
7. Advocacy and awareness campaigns: Launch advocacy and awareness campaigns to raise the visibility of beginner Arabic speakers' issues and challenges. Utilize social media, community events, and traditional media outlets to amplify their voices and push for policy changes that address their needs.
