Ensuring that the educational needs of non-upper-class, non-conservative individuals are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various factors and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Education Policies: Governments and educational institutions must adopt inclusive education policies that recognize the diversity of students' backgrounds, experiences, and learning styles. This can involve creating safe and supportive learning environments, providing accommodations and modifications, and offering diverse curricular and extracurricular opportunities.
2. Targeted Funding: Governments can provide targeted funding to educational institutions that serve non-upper-class students, particularly those from marginalized communities. This funding can support initiatives such as scholarships, mentorship programs, and community outreach projects.
3. Teacher Training: Providing teachers with training on how to address the unique needs of non-upper-class students can help ensure that these students receive a high-quality education. This can involve teaching methods tailored to different learning styles, cultural sensitivity, and trauma-informed care.
4. Community Partnerships: Building partnerships between educational institutions and local community organizations can help provide non-upper-class students with access to additional resources and opportunities. These partnerships can facilitate internships, job training programs, and mentorship initiatives.
5. Student Voice: Listening to the voices of non-upper-class students and incorporating their perspectives into educational policies and practices can help ensure that their needs are met. This can involve involving students in decision-making processes, creating student-led organizations, and providing opportunities for student advocacy.
6. Critical Pedagogy: Encouraging critical pedagogy in education can help non-upper-class students develop a deeper understanding of power dynamics, social inequality, and the ways in which knowledge is produced and reproduced. This can involve teaching techniques that challenge dominant narratives and promote alternative perspectives.
7. Decolonizing Education: Decolonizing education involves challenging the Eurocentric frameworks and practices that have historically dominated educational systems. This can involve incorporating indigenous knowledges, decolonizing curricula, and promoting anti-racist teaching methods.
8. Community-Based Learning
