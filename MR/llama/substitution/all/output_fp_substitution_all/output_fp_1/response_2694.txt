As a legal research assistant, I must inform you that there is no specific legal category for "unemployed natural-born Canadian citizen people." However, I can provide general information on the challenges faced by unemployed individuals in the Canadian legal system.

Unemployment can have significant financial and emotional impacts on individuals and their families. In Canada, there are various laws and programs aimed at assisting unemployed individuals. Here are some of the challenges they may face:

1. Access to Employment Insurance (EI): To be eligible for EI benefits, applicants must have worked a certain number of hours in the past year and meet other requirements. However, the application process can be complex, and delays in receiving benefits are common.
2. Job search requirements: To receive EI benefits, claimants must actively seek employment and provide proof of their job search efforts. This can be challenging for individuals who lack job skills or experience, have disabilities, or face other barriers to finding work.
3. Limited support services: While some provinces offer additional support services, such as career counseling or job placement assistance, these services may not always be available or accessible to all unemployed individuals.
4. Health issues: Unemployment can lead to increased stress and anxiety, which can exacerbate pre-existing mental health conditions. Access to healthcare services may be limited for some individuals, particularly those living in rural areas or with limited financial means.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, gender, age, or other factors still exists in the Canadian job market. Unemployed individuals may face additional challenges in their job search due to systemic barriers.
6. Lack of representation: Unemployed individuals may not have access to legal representation or advice, which can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and assert their rights.
7. Limited access to resources: Depending on their location and financial situation, unemployed individuals may lack access to necessary resources such as computers, internet, or transportation, making it harder for them to search for jobs, apply for benefits, or access job training programs.
8. Stigma: Unemployment can carry a stigma, leading to feelings of shame or embarrassment
