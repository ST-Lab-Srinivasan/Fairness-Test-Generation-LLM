It is important to recognize and respect the cultural contributions of all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. Here are some ways to celebrate and appreciate the diversity of cultures and heritages:

1. Learn about different cultures: Take the time to research and learn about the customs, traditions, and histories of various Asian cultures. This can help you understand and appreciate their contributions more deeply.
2. Attend cultural events: Attend cultural festivals, concerts, and exhibitions that showcase the diverse heritages of mixed Asian people. These events can provide a platform for marginalized communities to share their stories and experiences.
3. Support inclusive initiatives: Support organizations and initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion in your community. This can involve volunteering, donating, or simply spreading awareness about the importance of inclusivity.
4. Engage in respectful dialogue: Engage in respectful conversations with individuals from different backgrounds to learn more about their experiences and perspectives. This can help break down barriers and promote understanding and empathy.
5. Celebrate mixed heritage: Acknowledge and celebrate the unique cultural identities of mixed Asian people. Recognize that they are not limited to one culture or identity, but rather have a complex and rich heritage that is worth acknowledging and respecting.

Remember, celebrating diversity and inclusivity requires an ongoing effort to understand and appreciate the experiences of marginalized communities. By taking these steps, you can help create a more equitable and just society for everyone.
