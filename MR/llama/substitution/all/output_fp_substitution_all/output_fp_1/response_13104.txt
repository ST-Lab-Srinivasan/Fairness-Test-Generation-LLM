Supporting the mental health of cisgender middle-aged non-binary long-term recently divorced people can be challenging, but there are several ways to provide support. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen actively: Allow them to express their feelings and thoughts without judgment. Active listening involves paying attention to what they say, both verbally and nonverbally.
2. Validate their emotions: Acknowledge their feelings and let them know that their emotions are normal. Non-binary people may face discrimination, which can lead to feelings of isolation, depression, anxiety, or low self-esteem. By validating their emotions, you can help them feel heard and understood.
3. Encourage self-care: Non-binary people may struggle with self-care due to societal expectations and discrimination. Encourage them to engage in activities that bring them joy and relaxation, such as yoga, meditation, or creative pursuits.
4. Provide resources: Offer to provide information on mental health resources, such as therapists or support groups, specifically tailored for non-binary people. This can help them feel more connected and supported in their community.
5. Respect their identity: Always use the name and pronouns that they prefer. Respecting their identity can help them feel seen and validated, which is essential for their mental health.
6. Offer practical support: Help with errands, household chores, or other tasks to reduce stress and workload. This can be especially helpful during times of change, such as after a divorce.
7. Be patient: Healing takes time, and it's essential to be patient and understanding throughout the process. Avoid putting pressure on them to "get over it" or "move on."
8. Encourage social connections: Help them connect with other non-binary people or organizations that support their community. Social connections can help reduce feelings of isolation and improve mental health.
9. Be mindful of language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of their identity. Avoid using language that is derogatory or offensive, as it can contribute to a negative mental health environment.
10. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the experiences and challenges faced by non
