As a non-native Chinese speaker and a lawyer, I can attest that there are several challenges that beginner Chinese speakers may face in the legal system, particularly if they are native French speakers. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: The most significant challenge faced by beginner Chinese speakers is the language barrier. Chinese is a tonal language, and mastering the tones can be difficult for non-native speakers.
