Low-income ethnic African Americans face significant challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Limited access to care: Low-income individuals may have difficulty affording health insurance or accessing medical care due to barriers such as lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or limited hours of operation for healthcare providers.
2. Health disparities: African Americans are more likely to experience poor health outcomes compared to non-Hispanic whites, including higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, and lower life expectancy. This is due to a complex interplay of factors including socioeconomic status, access to healthy food and exercise opportunities, and cultural barriers to seeking medical care.
3. Lack of culturally competent care: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the unique health beliefs, practices, and cultural nuances of low-income ethnic African Americans, leading to inadequate or misdiagnosis.
