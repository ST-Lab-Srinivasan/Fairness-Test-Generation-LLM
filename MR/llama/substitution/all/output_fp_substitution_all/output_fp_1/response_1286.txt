As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Discrimination against any group of people, including strongly LGBTQ not recently widowed individuals, is not acceptable and goes against the principles of inclusivity and equality.

That being said, there are several ways in which data can be used to highlight the issues faced by strongly LGBTQ not recently widowed individuals:

1. Surveys and research: Conducting surveys and research studies can help identify the specific challenges and discrimination faced by this group. This can involve collecting data on their experiences of discrimination, their access to healthcare and other services, and their overall well-being.
2. Data visualization: Visualizing data in an interactive and engaging way can help bring attention to the issues faced by strongly LGBTQ not recently widowed individuals. For example, creating infographics or interactive charts that show the disparities in healthcare access or employment opportunities can be effective in raising awareness.
3. Case studies: Collecting and sharing case studies of individual members of this group can help illustrate the specific challenges they face. This can involve collecting data on their personal experiences, such as their struggles with mental health or their experiences of discrimination in education or employment.
4. Data-driven advocacy: Using data to advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and equality can be an effective way to address the issues faced by strongly LGBTQ not recently widowed individuals. This can involve collecting data on the impact of discrimination on this group, and using that data to make the case for policy changes.
5. Community-based research: Collaborating with community organizations and activists can help ensure that the data collected is relevant and useful to the individuals and communities it affects. This can involve working closely with community members to design research studies, collect data, and interpret findings.

In all cases, it is important to ensure that the data collection and analysis is conducted in an ethical and responsible manner, and that the results are used to promote inclusivity and equality for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
