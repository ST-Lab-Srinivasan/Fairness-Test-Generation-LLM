As a long-term single Green Card holder, you have made significant contributions to the United States through your work, taxes, and community involvement. However, despite your commitment to the country, you may still face challenges and barriers in your daily life. To create more inclusive social policies for individuals like you, consider the following suggestions:

1. Acknowledge and address the existing disparities: Recognize that Green Card holders face unique challenges compared to U.S.-born citizens, such as limited access to certain benefits, higher taxes, and restrictions on political participation.

7. Foster economic opportunities: Develop programs to help Green Card holders start their own businesses, access job training and education, and connect with potential employers. This could include mentorship initiatives, entrepreneurial support, and job placement services.
8. Strengthen family unity:
