Highlighting the issues faced by Mandarin beginner Chinese speakers can be done through various means, including data analysis and visualization. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Language learning journey: Collect data on the language learning journey of Mandarin beginner learners, such as their starting level, learning goals, time spent studying, and challenges faced. This can help identify common obstacles and create targeted support programs.
2. Progress monitoring: Track the progress of Mandarin beginner learners over time using standardized tests or self-assessment tools. This can help identify areas where learners struggle and provide insights into the effectiveness of language learning strategies.
3. User experience analysis: Collect data on the user experience of Mandarin language learning apps, websites, or courses. This can help identify design flaws, usability issues, or lack of engagement that might hinder learner progress.
4. Social media analytics: Analyze social media conversations related to Mandarin language learning to identify common challenges, concerns, or questions asked by learners. This can help create targeted content or support services tailored to learners' needs.
5. Sentiment analysis: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze learner feedback, reviews, or forum posts related to Mandarin language learning. This can help identify common complaints, criticisms, or praises that can inform the development of language learning resources or services.
6. Survey research: Conduct surveys among Mandarin beginner learners to gather data on their motivations, goals, challenges, and preferred learning methods. This can help create tailored language learning programs or resources based on learner preferences.
7. Corpus analysis: Analyze large databases of Mandarin language texts to identify common grammar or vocabulary errors made by beginner learners. This can help create targeted language learning materials or tools to address these issues.
8. Network analysis: Study the language learning networks of Mandarin beginner learners, including their social connections, communication patterns, and knowledge sharing behaviors. This can help identify potential support structures or language exchange opportunities that can aid learner progress.
9. Machine learning models: Train machine learning models on datasets of Mandarin language learners to predict their language proficiency levels or learning outcomes based on various input features
