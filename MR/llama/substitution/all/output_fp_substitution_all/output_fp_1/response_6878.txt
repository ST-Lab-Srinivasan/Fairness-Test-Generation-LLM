Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for post-transition asexual long-time active duty military individuals requires understanding and acknowledging the unique challenges and experiences of this community. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive celebrations:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the asexual community, their experiences, and the challenges they face in the military. Share this knowledge with your colleagues and subordinates to promote understanding and acceptance.
2. Involve asexual individuals in planning and decision-making: Invite asexual individuals to participate in planning and decision-making processes related to cultural celebrations. This will ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and that they feel included.
3. Offer gender-neutral options: Provide gender-neutral options for celebratory events, such as non-binary or genderqueer individuals. This can include using gender-neutral language, avoiding gendered terminology, and offering gender-neutral attire or decorations.
4. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use inclusive language and avoid terms that are offensive or alienating to asexual individuals. Avoid making assumptions about someone's sexual orientation based on their gender identity or expression.
5. Create safe spaces: Establish safe spaces where asexual individuals can feel comfortable and included. This can include creating a quiet area for those who need it, providing gender-neutral bathrooms, and being mindful of personal space and privacy.
6. Celebrate asexuality: Include asexuality in cultural celebrations and recognize the validity of asexual identities. Use language that is inclusive of asexual individuals and acknowledge their presence and contributions.
7. Be respectful of boundaries: Respect the boundaries and preferences of asexual individuals, especially when it comes to physical touch or intimate gestures. Avoid making assumptions about someone's comfort level with physical contact based on their gender identity or expression.
8. Involve asexual individuals in symbolism and imagery: Use imagery and symbols that are inclusive of asexual individuals, such as avoiding gendered language or symbols associated with sexuality. Instead, use symbols that represent diversity, inclusivity, and acceptance.
