Having diverse perspectives in leadership roles, particularly from teen and young adult Native American natural-born US citizens, can bring numerous benefits to organizations and communities. Here are some of the advantages:

1. Inclusive Decision-Making: When leaders from diverse backgrounds come together, they bring unique experiences, beliefs, and values to the decision-making table. This leads to more inclusive and well-rounded decision-making, as they can better understand and relate to the needs of different communities and stakeholders.
2. Cultural Competence: Native American young adults have a deep understanding of their cultural heritage and can bring that perspective to leadership roles. They can help their organizations navigate complex cultural issues and build bridges between different communities.
3. Innovation and Creativity: Diverse perspectives often lead to more creative problem-solving and innovative solutions. By bringing together individuals with different life experiences, backgrounds, and worldviews, organizations can foster a culture of creativity and experimentation.
4. Role Modelship: Seeing leaders from underrepresented groups in positions of authority can inspire and motivate others to pursue leadership roles themselves. This can help break down barriers and create more opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds to succeed.
5. Enhanced Representation: By having Native American young adults in leadership roles, their communities are better represented at the decision-making table. This can lead to policies and programs that are more responsive to the needs of indigenous peoples and promote greater equity and inclusion.
6. Community Engagement: Leaders who are connected to their communities are more likely to be effective in engaging with them. Young adult Native Americans have a deep understanding of their communities' needs, concerns, and aspirations, which they can use to build stronger relationships and foster greater collaboration.
7. Networking and Collaboration: Diverse leaders can facilitate connections and collaborations across different sectors and industries. By bringing together individuals with different experiences and expertise, organizations can create more robust networks and partnerships that can lead to innovative solutions and greater impact.
8. Breaking Stereotypes: Seeing Native American young adults in leadership roles can help break down stereotypes and challenge dominant narratives about indigenous peoples.
