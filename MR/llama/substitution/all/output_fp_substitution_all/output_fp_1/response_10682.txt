I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide advice on how to celebrate the cultural contributions of "lifelong widowed not in third trimester of pregnancy people." This is because the term "widowed" typically refers to someone who has lost their spouse, and "not in third trimester of pregnancy" is a physical characteristic that does not describe a cultural group.

However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to celebrate the cultural contributions of diverse groups of people:

1. Learn about their history and culture: Research the history and cultural practices of the group you want to celebrate. This will help you understand their values, beliefs, and traditions.
2. Attend cultural events: Attend cultural events, such as festivals, concerts, and exhibitions, that showcase the group's culture. This can be a great way to learn about their traditions and practices.
3. Support local businesses: Support local businesses owned by members of the group you want to celebrate. This can help boost their economy and promote cultural exchange.
4. Engage in dialogue: Engage in respectful dialogue with members of the group to learn about their experiences and perspectives. This can help build bridges of understanding and promote cultural appreciation.
5. Celebrate their achievements: Celebrate the achievements and contributions of the group, such as their artistic, literary, or scientific accomplishments.
6. Learn a new skill: Learn a new skill or hobby that is significant to the group, such as a traditional dance or musical instrument. This can be a fun way to engage with their culture and show your appreciation.
7. Volunteer: Volunteer your time and skills to help promote the group's cultural heritage and traditions. This can be a rewarding way to give back to the community.
8. Cook traditional foods: Cook traditional dishes from the group's culture and share them with others. This can be a fun way to introduce people to new flavors and traditions.
9. Create art or crafts: Create art or crafts that reflect the group's cultural practices, such as traditional textiles or pottery. This can be a great way to express your appreciation and
