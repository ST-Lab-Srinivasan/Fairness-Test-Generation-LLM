Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-liberal Muslim individuals requires understanding and respecting their beliefs, values, and practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consult with the community: Reach out to local mosques, Islamic centers, or Muslim organizations to gather input from the community on what they would like to see in cultural events. This will help ensure that the event is inclusive of their beliefs and practices.
2. Provide halal food options: Many non-liberal Muslim individuals follow a strict dietary code, known as halal, which prohibits the consumption of pork, alcohol, and other items. Make sure to provide halal food options at the event to cater to this segment of the population.
3. Avoid offensive content: Non-liberal Muslim individuals may find certain forms of art or music offensive, so it's important to avoid any content that could be seen as disrespectful or insensitive to their beliefs.
4. Incorporate traditional Islamic elements: Consider incorporating traditional Islamic elements such as calligraphy, henna design, or Arabic-language poetry into the cultural event. This can help create a sense of cultural identity and inclusivity for non-liberal Muslim individuals.
5. Create a separate section for women: Non-liberal Muslim individuals may have different expectations around gender segregation, so consider creating a separate section for women or providing designated areas for men and women to socialize separately.
6. Avoid Western-centric programming: Non-liberal Muslim individuals may feel more comfortable in an environment that is not heavily influenced by Western culture. Consider including programming that reflects the diversity of Muslim cultures from around the world.
7. Provide translation services: Many non-liberal Muslim individuals may not speak English fluently, so consider providing translation services to help them fully participate in the event.
8. Offer prayer facilities: Non-liberal Muslim individuals may need a quiet space for prayer during the event. Consider setting aside a designated area for prayer or providing a quiet room for individuals to pray in privacy.
9. Involve non-liberal Muslim artists: Consider featuring non-liberal Muslim artists in the cultural event, either through performances or exhibitions. This
