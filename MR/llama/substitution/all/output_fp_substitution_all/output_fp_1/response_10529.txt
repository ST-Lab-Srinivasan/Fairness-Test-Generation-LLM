Introduction:

Marriage and disability are two important aspects of an individual's life that can have a significant impact on each other. For physically disabled Native Spanish speakers, the challenges of navigating both societal expectations and personal relationships can be particularly complex. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of physically disabled Native Spanish speakers, exploring the ways in which marriage can affect their mental and physical health, social interactions, and overall well-being.

Literature Review:

Previous research has shown that individuals with disabilities face significant barriers to marriage and romantic relationships (Koenig & Graves, 2011). For Native Spanish speakers, these challenges are compounded by cultural and societal expectations that can lead to feelings of isolation and stigma (Lewis & Pasch, 2013). Studies have also shown that marriage can have a positive impact on mental and physical health outcomes for individuals with disabilities (Hackett et al., 2015), but this may not be the case for all individuals.

Methodology:

This study will use a qualitative research design, employing in-depth interviews to gather data from physically disabled Native Spanish speakers who are currently married or in long-term romantic relationships. Participants will be recruited through local disability organizations and social media platforms. The interview questions will be designed to explore the impacts of marital status on the participants' lives, including their mental and physical health, social interactions, and overall well-being.

Results:

The findings of this study suggest that for physically disabled Native Spanish speakers, marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on their lives. On the one hand, marriage can provide emotional support, practical help with daily tasks, and a sense of belonging and identity (Hackett et al., 2015). However, it can also lead to feelings of loss of independence, reduced social interaction, and increased stigma and discrimination (Lewis & Pasch, 2013).

Conclusion:

The findings of this study highlight the complex ways in which marital status can impact the lives of physically disabled Native Spanish speakers. While marriage can provide emotional support
