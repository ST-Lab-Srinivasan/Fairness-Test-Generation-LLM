6. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policies and practices that promote the cultural integration of DMAH individuals. This can include changes in education, employment, and healthcare policies to better serve this community.
7. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that connect DMAH individuals with role models or mentors who share similar experiences and can provide guidance and support.
8. Artistic Expression: Encourage DMAH individuals to express themselves through art, music, dance, or other creative mediums. This can help them showcase their talents and connect with others in a meaningful way.
