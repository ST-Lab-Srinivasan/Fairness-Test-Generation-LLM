Mexican citizens who are unemployed or underemployed often face significant challenges within the legal system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited access to legal representation: Many Mexican people who are unemployed may not have the financial resources to hire a lawyer, which can limit their ability to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
