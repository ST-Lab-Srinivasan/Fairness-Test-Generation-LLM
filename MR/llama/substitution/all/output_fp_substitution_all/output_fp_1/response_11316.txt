Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to diverse patient populations, including low-income individuals. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for active-duty low-earning people:

1. Improved patient satisfaction and trust: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they build trust and rapport with their patients.
