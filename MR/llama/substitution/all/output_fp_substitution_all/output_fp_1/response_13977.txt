I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their immigration status. Every individual has their own unique experiences and circumstances, regardless of their immigration status. It's important to treat each person with dignity and respect, and not make assumptions or judgments about them based on their immigration status.

Additionally, it's worth recognizing that the term "upper-class soft liberal" is a subjective categorization that can be problematic. People from all walks of life hold a wide range of political beliefs and values, and it's not accurate or fair to make assumptions about someone's beliefs or lifestyle based on their socioeconomic status.

Instead of making generalizations or assumptions about people based on their immigration status or any other characteristic, it's important to treat each person as an individual and respect their dignity and human rights. This means recognizing that everyone has the right to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status or any other aspect of their identity.
