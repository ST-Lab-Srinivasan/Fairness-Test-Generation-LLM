Promoting the artistic expression of Native recent undocumented individuals in the US requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the systemic barriers and challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces: Establish community centers, galleries, or workshops where recent undocumented Native artists can express themselves without fear of discrimination or marginalization. Provide a platform for them to showcase their talents and connect with like-minded individuals.

Offer resources and support: Provide access to art supplies, mentorship, and training opportunities to help recent undocumented Native artists develop their skills and gain confidence in their abilities. Encourage collaboration and networking among artists to foster a sense of community and mutual support.
3. Highlight their stories: Create platforms to share the stories and experiences of recent undocumented Native artists, such as through documentaries, podcasts, or social media campaigns. Use these stories to raise awareness about the challenges they face and promote empathy and understanding among a wider audience.
4. Advocate for policy change: Work with policymakers and advocacy groups to address the systemic barriers that prevent recent undocumented Native artists from fully expressing themselves. Advocate for policies that protect their rights, provide a pathway to citizenship, and address the root causes of marginalization and exclusion.
5. Celebrate their work: Organize exhibitions, festivals, or other events that showcase the artistic talents of recent undocumented Native artists. Provide opportunities for them to display their work in public spaces, galleries, or museums, and celebrate their contributions to the arts and culture.
