Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to diverse patient populations, including native French speakers who are recent immigrants to the US. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved communication: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent can communicate more effectively with patients from different cultural backgrounds.
