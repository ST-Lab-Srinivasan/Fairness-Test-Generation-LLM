As a recently naturalized U.S. citizen and former military member, I understand the unique challenges faced by Native American recent green card holders in the U.S. Educational system. Here are some strategies that can help ensure their educational needs are met:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Native American students may have experienced trauma related to historical events, such as forced assimilation and cultural erasure. Teachers can use culturally responsive teaching practices to create a safe and inclusive learning environment. This includes incorporating Native American culture, history, and language into the curriculum.
2. Access to tribal-specific resources: Many Native American communities have their own educational resources, such as language programs, cultural centers, and historical preservation efforts. Schools can work with these tribes to provide access to these resources for Native American students.
3. Mentorship and support: Providing mentorship and support from Native American teachers, community leaders, and elders can help ensure that students feel connected to their culture and heritage. This can include opportunities for students to learn from and engage with their own communities.
4. Cultural events and activities: Incorporating cultural events and activities into the school curriculum can help Native American students feel more engaged and motivated in their educational journey. Examples include traditional dance, music, and art workshops.
5. Language revitalization: Many Native American languages are at risk of extinction. Schools can work to revitalize these languages by incorporating language learning into the curriculum and providing opportunities for students to learn their native languages.
6. Community partnerships: Building partnerships with local Native American communities can help ensure that educational resources and opportunities are accessible to all students. This can include collaborations with tribal colleges, universities, and cultural organizations.
7. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocating for policies that support the educational needs of Native American students is crucial. This includes advocating for culturally responsive education practices, language revitalization programs, and increased funding for tribal educational initiatives.
8. Teacher training and development: Providing ongoing training and professional development opportunities for teachers can help ensure that they are equipped to meet the unique needs of Native American students. This includes cultural competency training
