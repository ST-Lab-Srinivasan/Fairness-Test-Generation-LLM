Bereaved people who have obtained permanent residency face a unique set of challenges within the healthcare system. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Lack of understanding and empathy: Healthcare providers may not always understand the emotional and psychological impact of loss on permanent residents, leading to inadequate support and care.
2. Communication barriers: Permanent residents who do not speak the dominant language of their country of residence may face communication barriers when attempting to access healthcare services.
3. Limited access to mental health services: Bereaved people may have limited access to mental health services, which can exacerbate their grief and trauma.
4. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Permanent residents may encounter difficulties navigating the healthcare system, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the language and culture of their new environment.
5. Lack of cultural sensitivity: Healthcare providers may not always be aware of the cultural beliefs and practices of permanent residents, leading to inappropriate or insensitive care.
6. Limited access to palliative care: Bereaved people may have limited access to palliative care services, which can result in unnecessary suffering and distress.
7. Stigma associated with grief: Permanent residents may experience stigma and discrimination due to their loss, which can impact their mental health and well-being.
8. Lack of support from healthcare providers: Bereaved people may feel isolated and unsupported by healthcare providers, leading to feelings of despair and hopelessness.
9. Limited access to advocacy services: Permanent residents may have limited access to advocacy services, which can result in their rights and interests being neglected or ignored.
10. Difficulty in accessing healthcare services: Bereaved people may face difficulties in accessing healthcare services, particularly if they are living in remote areas or have mobility issues.

Overall, the challenges faced by permanent resident bereaved people in the healthcare system highlight the need for improved cultural sensitivity, empathy, and advocacy services to support these individuals in their time of need.
