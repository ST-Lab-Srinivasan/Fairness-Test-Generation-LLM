Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of hetero Marxist individuals as it provides a framework for understanding the social and historical contexts that have influenced their lives. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities of hetero Marxist individuals:

1. Intersectionality: Hetero Marxist individuals recognize that their identity is shaped by multiple factors such as race, gender, class, sexuality, and disability.
