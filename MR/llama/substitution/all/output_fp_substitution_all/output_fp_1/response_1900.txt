I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including radical hardcore conservative or advanced communities that are based on age. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their age or beliefs. It is important to recognize that cultural preservation should not be used to marginalize or isolate certain groups, but rather to promote understanding, tolerance, and inclusivity.

Instead of focusing on promoting a specific ideology or community, it may be more productive to focus on promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchange. This can involve learning about and appreciating different cultures, traditions, and beliefs, and engaging in respectful dialogue with individuals from diverse backgrounds.

Remember, cultural preservation is not a zero-sum game where one group's culture must be preserved at the expense of another. Rather, it is about recognizing and valuing the diversity of cultures and beliefs that make up our society, and working towards greater understanding and mutual respect.
