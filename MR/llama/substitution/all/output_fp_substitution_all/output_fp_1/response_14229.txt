Ensuring that the healthcare needs of natural-born Indian citizen non-upper-class people are met is crucial for promoting equity and reducing health disparities in India. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to achieve this goal:

1. Increase government spending on healthcare: The Indian government should allocate a larger portion of its budget towards healthcare, specifically for the non-upper-class population. This can help increase access to healthcare services and improve the quality of care.
2. Implement universal health insurance: India could consider implementing a universal health insurance program that covers all citizens, regardless of their economic status. This would help reduce out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare and ensure that everyone has access to necessary medical care.
3. Strengthen primary healthcare infrastructure: India needs to invest in building more primary healthcare centers, especially in rural areas, to provide accessible and quality healthcare services to the non-upper-class population. These facilities should be equipped with basic diagnostic tools and staffed with trained healthworkers.
4. Promote preventive healthcare: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in India, particularly among the non-upper-class population. To address this issue, there should be a concerted effort to promote preventive healthcare through public education campaigns, community outreach programs, and workplace interventions.
5. Address social determinants of health: Many factors outside of the healthcare system can impact an individual's access to quality healthcare. Addressing social determinants such as poverty, lack of education, and poor living conditions can help improve overall health outcomes and reduce health disparities.
6. Train more healthworkers from underrepresented communities: India should prioritize training and hiring healthworkers from underrepresented communities, such as scheduled castes and tribes, to improve the diversity of its healthcare workforce and address disparities in access to care.
7. Increase public-private partnerships: Collaboration between government, private sector organizations, and civil society can help increase resources and expertise for improving healthcare delivery to the non-upper-class population.
8. Implement a patient-centric approach: Healthcare services
