Ensuring the educational needs of students with cognitive impairments, including those who are transgender or gender-diverse, requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that schools can use to meet the educational needs of these students:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Schools should strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students, including those with cognitive impairments or who are transgender or gender-diverse. This can involve providing support staff, such as counselors or social workers, who are trained in working with diverse student populations.
