Ensuring that the healthcare needs of natural-born Indian citizens with moderate incomes are met is a critical challenge for India's healthcare system. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase public investment in primary healthcare: Primary healthcare is the foundation of any healthcare system, and it is essential to ensure that it is accessible and affordable for everyone, including those with moderate incomes. The government should increase its investment in primary healthcare infrastructure, personnel, and services to improve accessibility and quality.
2. Implement a universal healthcoverage scheme: A universal health coverage (UHC) scheme can help ensure that everyone has access to essential healthcare services without any financial hardship. The government can explore different models of UHC, such as a single-payer system or a mixed model with both public and private providers.
3. Promote preventive care: Preventive care is critical for maintaining good health, and it can help reduce healthcare costs in the long run. The government can promote preventive care by providing incentives to individuals and families who prioritize preventive care, such as regular check-ups, vaccinations, and health screenings.
4. Foster public-private partnerships: Public-private partnerships can help leverage the strengths of both sectors to improve healthcare outcomes. The government can collaborate with private providers to deliver quality healthcare services to moderate-income individuals at affordable prices.
5. Strengthen healthworkforce capacity: India faces a significant shortage of healthcare professionals, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. The government should invest in training programs for healthcare workers and provide incentives to attract and retain talent in underserved areas.
6. Improve supplychain management: Efficient supply chain management can help reduce costs and improve access to essential medicines and medical supplies. The government can work with pharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders to develop a robust supply chain management system.
7. Encourage telemedicine: Telemedicine can help bridge the gap between urban and rural areas, and it can improve access to healthcare services for moderate-income individuals living in remote areas. The government should encourage telemedicine services by providing infrastructure support
