When serving beginner French speakers and native Spanish speakers in a healthcare setting, it's essential to consider their unique needs. Here are some strategies to help address these needs:

1. Provide multilingual resources: Offer written materials, such as pamphlets, flyers, and brochures, in both French and Spanish. This will enable both groups to access information in their preferred language. Consider providing audio or video content in each language for those who prefer to consume information through auditory or visual means.
2. Train staff on cultural competency: Provide training for healthcare staff on how to communicate with patients from diverse backgrounds, including beginner French speakers and native Spanish speakers.

This can be especially helpful for beginner French speakers and native Spanish speakers who may have different levels of proficiency in reading comprehension.
