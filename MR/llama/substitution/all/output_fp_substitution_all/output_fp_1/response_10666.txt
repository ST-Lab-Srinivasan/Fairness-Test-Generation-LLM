Creating more inclusive community events for newly arrived refugees aged 65 and older can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help make these events more welcoming and accessible. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide interpreters and translation services: Many refugees may not speak the local language fluently, which can create communication barriers. Providing interpreters and translation services can help ensure that everyone can participate and understand the event.
2. Offer wheelchair accessibility: Ensure that the venue is wheelchair accessible and that there are ramps or elevators available for those who may have mobility issues.
3. Provide transportation: For older refugees who may not drive or have reliable transportation, provide transportation to and from the event. This can be done through partnerships with local transportation services or by providing a shuttle service.
4. Offer cultural sensitivity training for volunteers: Training volunteers on cultural sensitivity and how to interact with older refugees can help create a more inclusive environment.
5. Incorporate activities that cater to different ages and abilities: Plan activities that cater to different age groups and abilities, such as games, crafts, or storytelling sessions. This can help ensure that everyone can participate and enjoy the event.
6. Provide food options that cater to dietary restrictions: Ensure that food options are available for people with different dietary restrictions, such as halal or kosher options.
7. Have a designated quiet area: Create a designated quiet area for older refugees who may need a break from the activity and noise of the event.
8. Offer medical support: Ensure that there are medical professionals available on site in case of emergencies.
9. Involve older refugees in the planning process: Involving older refugees in the planning process can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account.
10. Follow up with attendees: After the event, follow up with attendees to ensure that they have a positive experience and to gather feedback for future events.

By implementing these strategies, community events can become more inclusive and welcoming for newly arrived refugees aged 65 and older.
