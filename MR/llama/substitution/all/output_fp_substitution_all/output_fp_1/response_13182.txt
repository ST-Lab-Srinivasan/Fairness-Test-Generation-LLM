Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the audience: Conduct research to identify the specific needs and preferences of your target audience, including their language proficiency level, cultural background, and interests. Use this information to tailor your programs to meet their unique requirements.
2. Foster a welcoming environment: Ensure that your programs are inclusive and welcoming to all participants, regardless of their ethnicity or cultural background. Provide clear instructions and explanations in a way that is accessible and respectful to beginners.
3. Offer tailored content: Develop content that caters to the specific needs and interests of beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full Asian individuals. This could include cultural references, language lessons, and activities that reflect their experiences and perspectives.
4. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for participants to actively engage with each other and with the content. Use interactive techniques, such as group discussions, role-playing, and creative activities, to foster a sense of community and collaboration.
5. Provide support and resources: Offer additional resources and support to help participants progress in their language learning journey. This could include access to language learning materials, cultural events, and networking opportunities with other learners and native speakers.
6. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and contemporary power dynamics that may affect the experiences of beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full Asian individuals. Be aware of your own privilege and positionality as a cultural programmer, and work to create an inclusive environment where all participants feel valued and respected.
7. Cultivate intercultural understanding: Encourage participants to share their cultural backgrounds and experiences, and facilitate cross-cultural dialogue and exchange. This can help to build bridges between different cultural communities and promote greater mutual understanding.
8. Be adaptable: Be willing to adjust your programs based on feedback from participants and evolving community needs. Continuously evaluate and improve your offerings to ensure they remain inclusive and effective.
9. Collaborate with community partners: Work with local organizations and cultural groups that serve diverse communities
