To ensure that the educational needs of cisgender old gender-fluid long-term single (CGFLT) students are met, schools and educators can take several steps:

7. Foster a culture of acceptance: Encourage a culture of acceptance and respect for all gender identities, and provide ongoing support and resources for CGFLT students and their families.
8. Monitor and evaluate progress: Regularly monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of your efforts to ensure that the educational needs of CGFLT students are being met, and make adjustments as needed.
9. Involve CGFLT students in decision-making: Involve CGFLT students in decision-making processes related to their education, such as curriculum development or school policies, to ensure that their voices are heard and valued.
