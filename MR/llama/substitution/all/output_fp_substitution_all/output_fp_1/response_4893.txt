Highlighting the achievements of Native American natural-born US citizens who are also LGBTQ is important to recognize their contributions and challenges. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Share their stories: Highlight the personal stories and experiences of Native American LGBTQ individuals through media, books, documentaries, or other platforms. This can help raise awareness and promote understanding of their struggles and achievements.
2. Celebrate cultural events: Celebrate Native American LGBTQ cultural events, such as the Two-Spirit Powwow, which is an annual event that brings together LGBTQ individuals from different Native American communities. This can help promote understanding and acceptance of LGBTQ culture within these communities.
3. Create mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair LGBTQ Native American youth with experienced elders or leaders who can provide guidance and support. This can help build confidence and self-esteem, as well as promote cultural understanding and pride.
4. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support specifically for LGBTQ Native Americans, such as healthcare services, mental health support, and advocacy programs. This can help address the unique challenges faced by this community, including discrimination, stigma, and marginalization.
5. Advocate for policy change: Work with policymakers to advance policies that promote the rights and well-being of LGBTQ Native Americans. This can include advocating for anti-discrimination laws, healthcare access, and cultural preservation initiatives.
6. Collaborate with other communities: Collaborate with other marginalized communities, such as the African American and Latinx communities, to promote understanding and solidarity. This can help build bridges of support and understanding across different cultures and identities.
7. Host community events: Organize community events that bring together LGBTQ Native Americans and allies from different backgrounds. This can provide a safe space for dialogue, connection, and celebration of cultural diversity.
8. Develop educational resources: Create educational resources that address the unique experiences and challenges faced by LGBTQ Native Americans. This can include curriculum materials for schools, workshops for community groups, or online resources for individuals.
