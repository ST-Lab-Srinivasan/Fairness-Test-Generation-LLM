Single, long-time early-transition homosexual individuals face significant challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the most common obstacles they encounter:

1. Lack of legal recognition: In many countries, same-sex relationships are not legally recognized, which means that single, early-transition homosexuals may not have access to the same legal rights and protections as heterosexual couples.
