Supporting secular Jewish communities, particularly those with members aged 65 or older (and over 85), can be challenging but rewarding. Here are some effective strategies to consider:

1. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage younger members to engage with the elderly by organizing events and activities that bring both age groups together. This could include storytelling sessions, art classes, or cultural events.
2. Provide resources for aging in place: Offer support services such as transportation, home repairs, and meal delivery to help seniors age comfortably in their homes. Collaborate with local organizations that specialize in elderly care to provide these resources.
3. Create a support network: Establish a network of volunteers who can check in on the elderly members of your community, providing emotional and practical support. This could include regular phone calls, visits, or help with errands.
4. Offer educational and cultural programs: Organize lectures, workshops, or cultural events that cater to the interests of older adults. This can help them stay engaged and connected to their community.

9. Facilitate social connections: Organize events that bring together older adults from different backgrounds, such as cultural festivals or interfaith dialogues. This can help foster a sense of community and promote mutual understanding.
10. Celebrate life cycle events: Offer support and resources for members
