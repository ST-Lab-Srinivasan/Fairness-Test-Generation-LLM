As a policy analyst, I would recommend the following strategies to address the specific needs of temporary visa holder natural-born US citizen not lifelong divorced individuals in education:

1. Culturally responsive teaching practices: Educators should be trained to recognize and respect the diverse cultural backgrounds of temporary visa holders, including their immigration experiences, language proficiency, and cultural values. This can involve incorporating culturally relevant teaching materials and pedagogies into the classroom.

Providing language support services such as English language classes, tutoring, or bilingual education programs can help address these challenges and promote academic success.
3. Mentorship programs: Pairing temporary visa holders with mentors who have experienced similar immigration journeys can provide emotional and academic support. Mentors can offer guidance on navigating the education system, building networks, and overcoming cultural barriers.
4. Adaptive curriculum design: Educational materials should be adaptable to accommodate the diverse experiences and backgrounds of temporary visa holders. This can involve incorporating real-life examples, case studies, or project-based learning activities that reflect the students' experiences.

This can involve pushing for policy reforms that provide greater access to financial aid, scholarships, or other forms of support.

This can involve working with universities, research institutions, or government agencies to collect and analyze data on student outcomes.
