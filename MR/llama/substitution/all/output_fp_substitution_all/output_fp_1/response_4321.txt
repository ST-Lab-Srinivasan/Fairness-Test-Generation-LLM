The impact of disability status on the lives of non-citizens can be significant and far-reaching, affecting various aspects of their daily life. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to healthcare: Non-citizens with disabilities may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about available resources, or fear of deportation.
2. Employment: Discrimination against people with disabilities is common, and non-citizens with disabilities may face additional challenges in finding employment. They may be less likely to be hired or promoted due to their disability status.
3. Education: Non-citizens with disabilities may encounter barriers in accessing education, such as lack of accommodations, discrimination, or limited English language proficiency.
4. Social isolation: Non-citizens with disabilities may experience social isolation due to cultural and linguistic barriers, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression.
5. Access to benefits: Non-citizens with disabilities may face difficulties in accessing government benefits, such as Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Medicaid, due to their immigration status.
6. Legal rights: Non-citizens with disabilities may have limited access to legal resources and support, making it difficult for them to navigate the court system or advocate for their rights.
7. Housing: Non-citizens with disabilities may encounter difficulties in finding accessible housing, leading to homelessness or substandard living conditions.
8. Transportation: Non-citizens with disabilities may face barriers in accessing transportation, such as public transportation systems that are not wheelchair accessible or lack of transportation options for those who are unable to drive.
9. Language barriers: Non-citizens with disabilities may encounter language barriers that hinder their ability to communicate and access resources, leading to feelings of frustration and isolation.
10. Stigma and discrimination: People with disabilities, especially those who are non-citizens, may face stigma and discrimination from their communities, which can lead to social exclusion and marginalization.

It is important to recognize that these impacts are not limited to newly
