Ensuring the educational needs of active duty military beginners, including those who are Spanish speakers, can be challenging due to various factors such as deployment schedules, remote learning requirements, and language barriers. However, there are several strategies that institutions can adopt to meet their educational needs:

1. Offer flexible learning options: Developing flexible learning paths that can accommodate the unique demands of military service members can help them continue their education without interruptions. This may involve offering online courses or hybrid programs that can be completed at their own pace.
2. Provide language support: To address the language barrier, institutions can offer language support services such as tutoring, translation assistance, and language classes specifically designed for Spanish speakers.
3. Develop partnerships with military organizations: Building partnerships with military organizations can help institutions better understand the needs of military beginner students and tailor their educational programs accordingly. This may involve collaborating with military bases or organizations to offer courses that cater to the unique requirements of service members.
4. Utilize technology: Leveraging technology can help overcome some of the challenges faced by military beginners, such as limited access to resources on base or during deployments. Institutions can use virtual learning environments and mobile apps to deliver course content and support services remotely.
5. Provide academic advising: Offering personalized academic advising can help military beginner students navigate the educational system and choose courses that align with their career goals. This may involve working closely with military organizations to identify the specific needs of service members and provide tailored advice.
6. Create a sense of community: Building a sense of community among military beginner students can help them feel more connected and supported in their academic pursuits. Institutions can foster this sense of community through events, clubs, or organizations that bring together students with similar interests and goals.
7. Offer credit for prior learning: To help military beginners make progress towards their academic goals, institutions can offer credit for prior learning experiences, such as military training or work experience. This can help them accelerate their academic progress and reduce the time it takes to complete a degree.
8. Develop transferable skills: Military service members often possess valuable skills that are transferable to an academic setting. Institutions can help these students by identifying and recognizing these skills, and incorporating them into their academic programs.
