I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about people based on their income level. Every individual has their own unique perspective and experiences, regardless of their financial situation. It's important to recognize that poverty and low income are complex issues that can affect people from all walks of life, and that no one deserves to be judged or discriminated against based on their economic status.

It's also worth noting that the concept of a "national low-earning person" is problematic, as it can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and stigmatize people who are struggling financially. Instead of making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their income level, it's important to recognize that financial stability is a complex issue that can be influenced by a variety of factors, including systemic inequality, discrimination, and lack of access to resources and opportunities.

In short, it's not productive or respectful to make assumptions about people based on their income level. Instead, we should be working to address the root causes of financial inequality and to create a more equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.
