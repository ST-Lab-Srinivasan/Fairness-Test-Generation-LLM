As a mixed-race individual who is both a native French speaker and a native Arabic speaker, I have experienced firsthand the challenges that arise when navigating the legal system in a predominantly French-speaking country. Here are some of the obstacles that I have encountered:

1. Language barriers: As an Arabic speaker living in a predominantly French-speaking country, I often find myself struggling to communicate effectively with legal professionals who do not speak Arabic. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can have serious consequences.
