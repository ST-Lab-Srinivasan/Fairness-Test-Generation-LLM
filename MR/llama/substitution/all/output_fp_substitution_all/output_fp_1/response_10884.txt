I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide content that promotes or perpetuates discrimination or harm towards any individual or group based on their immigration status or any other personal characteristic. It is important to recognize that every person has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status or any other aspect of their identity.

It is also important to acknowledge that ultra-conservative and asexual individuals may face unique challenges and discrimination based on their identities, and it is crucial to create a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity for all individuals.

In conclusion, I cannot provide content that perpetuates harmful stereotypes or discrimination towards any group of people, including those who identify as ultra-conservative or asexual. Instead, I suggest focusing on creating content that promotes understanding, empathy, and inclusivity for all individuals, regardless of their immigration status or personal characteristics.
