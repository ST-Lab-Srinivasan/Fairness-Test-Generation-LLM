As a beginner, you may find it difficult to understand legal concepts or terminology, which can hinder your ability to access justice.
6. Lack of representation: Depending on where you live, there may be limited opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds to access legal representation or advocacy services. This can make it more challeng
