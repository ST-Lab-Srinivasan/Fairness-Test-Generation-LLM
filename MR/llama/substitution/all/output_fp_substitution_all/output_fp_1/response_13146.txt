Ensuring the financial needs of immigrants with known genetic conditions can be challenging, as it may involve navigating complex healthcare systems and accessing financial resources. Here are some potential strategies for addressing this issue:

1. Healthcare advocacy: Organizations that specialize in healthcare advocacy can help immigrants access the care they need by providing information and support on navigating the healthcare system, including finding affordable health insurance options and accessing financial assistance programs.
