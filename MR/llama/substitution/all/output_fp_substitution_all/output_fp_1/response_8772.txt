4. Accessibility: Ensure that event spaces are accessible for individuals with disabilities, including those who may need accommodations such as wheelchair access or sign language interpretation.
5. Representation: Incorporate representation of different ethnicities and cultures within the celebrations, such as through music, dance, art, or other forms of cultural expression. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and ensure that everyone feels seen and valued.
6. Respectful Dress Code: Encourage attendees to dress in respectful attire that is appropriate for the occasion and avoid cultural appropriation.
7. Food and Beverage Options: Offer a variety of food and beverage options that cater to different dietary restrictions and preferences, including vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and halal options.
8. Inclusive Programming: Create programming that includes elements of Monastic Buddhist culture and traditions, such as meditation sessions, chanting, or other cultural practices.
