The impact of immigration status on the lives of long-term married couples during the third trimester of pregnancy can be significant, particularly for the non-citizen spouse. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Depending on their immigration status, non-citizen spouses may face barriers in accessing prenatal care and other healthcare services. They might encounter difficulties in finding a provider who accepts their insurance or encounter language barriers.
2. Fear of deportation: The fear of deportation can be overwhelming for non-citizen spouses, especially during a high-stress time like pregnancy. This fear can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
3. Separation from support networks: Non-citizen spouses may feel disconnected from their support networks, such as family and friends, due to immigration restrictions. This can exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness during pregnancy.
