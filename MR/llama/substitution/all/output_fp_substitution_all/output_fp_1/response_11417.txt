Divorce is a complex and challenging life event that can have far-reaching consequences on an individual's mental, emotional, and social well-being. For newly divorced native Arabic speaker individuals, the experience can be even more daunting due to cultural and language barriers. As a result, it is crucial to address their specific needs in a master's graduate program to ensure their academic success and overall well-being. This paper outlines strategies for accommodating these needs and promoting inclusivity in higher education.
