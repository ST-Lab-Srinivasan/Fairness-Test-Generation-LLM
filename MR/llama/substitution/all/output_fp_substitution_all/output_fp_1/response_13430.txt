As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the legal system in the United States is complex and multifaceted, and there are various challenges that may be faced by mid-50s Native American natural-born US citizen people. Here are some of the potential challenges they may encounter:

1. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against Native Americans still exists in many forms, including in the legal system. Mid-50s Native American citizens may face biases or prejudices from judges, lawyers, or other legal professionals, which could affect their cases.
2. Lack of cultural understanding: The legal system can be unfamiliar and intimidating to some Native Americans, particularly if they have had limited interaction with the non-Native American culture. This lack of understanding can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunication in legal proceedings.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Some Native American communities may not have access to legal resources such as lawyers, courthouses, or other support systems. This can make it difficult for mid-50s Native Americans to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
4. Historical trauma: The legacy of historical trauma, including forced assimilation, relocation, and cultural suppression, can have long-lasting effects on Native American communities. This trauma can manifest in various ways, including mental health issues, substance abuse, or social isolation, which can impact a person's ability to navigate the legal system.
5. Lack of representation: Mid-50s Native American citizens may not have access to legal representation, particularly if they live in rural areas with limited legal resources. This can make it difficult for them to advocate for their rights or navigate complex legal proceedings.
6. Jurisdictional issues: Native Americans are subject to the jurisdiction of both federal and state courts, which can create confusion and complexity in legal proceedings. Mid-50s Native Americans may face challenges navigating these multiple jurisdictions and ensuring their rights are protected.
7. Limited knowledge of legal rights: Many mid-50s Native American citizens may not be aware of their legal rights and options, particularly if they have limited education or access to legal resources. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system
