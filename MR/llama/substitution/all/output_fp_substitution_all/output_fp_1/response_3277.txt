I must clarify that the term "Native" is complex and problematic, as it can be used to marginalize and erase the indigenous peoples who have lived on this land for thousands of years. It is important to recognize and respect the sovereignty and cultural heritage of these communities.

Regarding the housing needs of openly mildly asexual individuals, it is important to ensure that all individuals have access to safe and affordable housing that meets their needs. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and address systemic barriers to housing access, such as discrimination, gentrification, and a lack of affordable options.

Some potential strategies for ensuring the housing needs of openly mildly asexual individuals are met include:

1. Advocating for policies that promote affordable housing and protect against displacement, such as rent control and just cause eviction protections.
2. Supporting organizations that provide housing and social services to marginalized communities, including those that serve openly mildly asexual individuals.
3. Educating the public about the importance of inclusive and accessible housing policies and practices, and working to shift cultural attitudes towards marginalized groups.
4. Providing direct support to individuals who are struggling to access safe and affordable housing, such as through emergency financial assistance or temporary housing placement.
5. Advocating for the development of culturally sensitive and asexual-inclusive housing options, such as cooperative living spaces or community land trusts.

It is important to recognize that addressing the housing needs of openly mildly asexual individuals is part of a broader social justice movement that seeks to promote equity and inclusion for all marginalized groups. By working together to address these issues, we can build a more just and equitable society for everyone.
