Ensuring that the healthcare needs of natural-born Indian citizens who are out of work are met is a critical issue in India. Here are some steps that can be taken to address this challenge:

1. Increase access to affordable healthcare: One of the primary reasons why people lose their jobs is due to economic downturns or medical conditions. Ensuring that everyone has access to affordable healthcare can help reduce the financial burden on individuals and families, thereby reducing the likelihood of them losing their jobs due to health issues.
2. Implement a comprehensive social safety net: A robust social safety net can provide financial support to individuals who have lost their jobs due to no fault of their own. This could include unemployment benefits, livelihood support, and other forms of assistance that help people get back on their feet quickly.
3. Promote job training and placement services: Providing job training and placement services can help individuals acquire new skills and find employment opportunities more quickly. This can be especially important for people who have been out of work for an extended period, as it can help them get back into the job market faster.
4. Encourage entrepreneurship: Encouraging entrepreneurship can provide individuals with an alternative source of income and help create jobs in the economy. This could involve providing training and support to start-ups and small businesses, as well as creating an enabling environment for entrepreneurs to thrive.
5. Address underlying social issues: Poverty, lack of education, and other social issues can contribute to unemployment. Addressing these underlying issues through policies and programs that promote inclusive growth can help reduce the number of people who are out of work due to structural factors.
6. Improve access to affordable housing: Lack of affordable housing can be a significant challenge for people who have lost their jobs, particularly in urban areas. Improving access to affordable housing can help reduce the financial burden on individuals and families, making it easier for them to get back on their feet quickly.
7. Provide mental health support: Job loss can be emotionally challenging, and providing mental health support can help individuals cope with the emotional impact of unemployment. This could involve counseling services, hotlines, and other forms of mental health support.
