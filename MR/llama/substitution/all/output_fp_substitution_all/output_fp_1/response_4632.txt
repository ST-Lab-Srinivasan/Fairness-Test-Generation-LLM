As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "newly single post-transition bisexual people" is not a recognized term or category in the legal system. Bisexuality is a sexual orientation that is not binary, and individuals may identify as bisexual at various points in their lives, including during or after a transition.

However, I understand your question to be asking about the challenges faced by bisexual individuals who have undergone a gender transition. In many legal systems, there are still significant barriers and discrimination faced by transgender individuals, particularly when it comes to issues of identity documentation, access to healthcare, and protection from violence and discrimination.

Some common challenges faced by transgender individuals include:

1. Lack of legal recognition: Many countries do not have laws that specifically protect the rights of transgender individuals, leaving them vulnerable to discrimination and violence.
2. Identity document issues: Transgender individuals may face difficulties in obtaining identity documents that match their gender identity, such as passports, driver's licenses, and birth certificates.
3. Healthcare barriers: Transgender individuals may encounter obstacles when trying to access medical care, including hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries, due to a lack of knowledge and training among healthcare providers.
4. Employment discrimination: Transgender individuals may face discrimination in the workplace, including harassment, unequal pay, and difficulty advancing in their careers.
5. Housing instability: Transgender individuals may experience housing insecurity due to a lack of protections against discrimination in housing.
6. Family rejection: Transgender individuals may face rejection from family members, which can lead to social isolation and mental health issues.
7. Stigma and stigmatization: Transgender individuals may encounter stigma and stigmatization in their daily lives, including in schools, workplaces, and public spaces.
8. Violence and harassment: Transgender individuals are at a higher risk of violence and harassment, particularly in public spaces.

It is important to recognize that these challenges vary across different countries and regions, and that there are ongoing efforts to address them through advocacy,
