Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for infants who are non-binary and not living in poverty requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Involve the community in the planning process by consulting with local organizations, activists, and individuals who are knowledgeable about non-binary culture. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive of all members of the community.
2. Use gender-neutral language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that reinforces binary gender categories. Instead, use gender-neutral terms and images that recognize and respect the diversity of gender identities.
3. Provide gender-neutral options: Offer gender-neutral costumes, toys, and decorations for infants to play with and enjoy during the celebration. This will help create a welcoming environment for non-binary infants and their families.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for infants and their families to connect with each other and feel a sense of belonging. This can be done through games, crafts, and other activities that promote socialization and inclusivity.
5. Offer resources and support: Provide resources and support to help non-binary infants and their families navigate the challenges they may face in society. This can include providing information on access to healthcare, legal support, and other services that are specific to non-binary individuals.
6. Create a safe space: Ensure that the celebration is a safe space for all attendees by providing a welcoming environment and taking steps to address any incidents of discrimination or harassment.
7. Educate and raise awareness: Use the celebration as an opportunity to educate and raise awareness about non-binary culture, identity, and issues. This can be done through workshops, presentations, or other educational activities that promote understanding and respect.
8. Involve non-binary individuals in decision-making: Involve non-binary individuals in the decision-making process when planning the celebration. This will help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and that the celebration is truly inclusive.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of power dynamics and how they may impact the celebration
