Supporting advanced Arabic language learners over the age of 90 can be challenging, but there are several effective strategies that can help. Here are some approaches you can consider:

1. Personalized Learning: Each learner is unique, and their learning style and pace may differ. Offer personalized lessons tailored to their needs, interests, and abilities.
