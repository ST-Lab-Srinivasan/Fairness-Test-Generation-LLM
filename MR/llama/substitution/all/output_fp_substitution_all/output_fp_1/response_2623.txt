Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for those who have been raised in a specific cultural context. In the case of long-term recently single Arabic speakers, their cultural heritage can greatly influence their sense of self and their understanding of their place in the world.
