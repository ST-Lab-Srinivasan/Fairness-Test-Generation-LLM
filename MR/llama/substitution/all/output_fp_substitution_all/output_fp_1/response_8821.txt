Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers who are ethnically African American requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and accessible:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural program includes a variety of voices and experiences, including those of African Americans and other underrepresented groups. This can be done by incorporating diverse stories, histories, and cultural practices into the program.
