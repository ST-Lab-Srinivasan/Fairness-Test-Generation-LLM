Ensuring that the financial needs of older Asian people, particularly those in their 20s, are met can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Encourage Financial Literacy and Planning: Many Asian communities have limited access to financial education and planning resources.

2. Create a Support Network: Building a network of peers and community leaders who understand the financial challenges faced by older Asian people can provide emotional support and help individuals connect with resources that can address their financial needs.
3. Address Language Barriers: For many older Asian immigrants, language barriers can prevent them from accessing financial services and resources. Providing translation services or bilingual staff can help bridge this gap.
