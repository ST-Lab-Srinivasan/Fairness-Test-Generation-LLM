Promoting the inclusion of Native American recent undocumented immigrants in the US active-duty military is a laudable goal, but it requires addressing the systemic barriers that have historically excluded these communities from military service. Here are some strategies that could help promote their inclusion:

1. Outreach and Education: Conduct outreach and education efforts in Native American communities to raise awareness about the benefits of military service and how to access it. Provide information on the enlistment process, educational opportunities, and career advancement prospects within the military.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for military recruiters and personnel to help them understand the unique challenges faced by Native American communities and how to engage with them in a respectful and inclusive manner.
3. Partnership with Native American Organizations: Develop partnerships with Native American organizations, such as tribal governments, to leverage their networks and resources for outreach and recruitment efforts. This can help build trust and credibility within the community.
4. Scholarships and Financial Assistance: Offer scholarships and financial assistance to Native American students interested in pursuing a military career. This can help alleviate financial barriers that may discourage them from enlisting.
5. Language Support: Provide language support services, such as interpretation and translation, to help Native American recruits navigate the enlistment process and access military resources.
6. Specialized Training: Develop specialized training programs tailored to the unique needs and cultural backgrounds of Native American recruits. This can help them successfully transition into military service and overcome any challenges they may face.
7. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair recent undocumented immigrants with experienced military personnel from similar backgrounds. This can provide valuable guidance, support, and role modeling throughout their military journey.
8. Advocacy and Policy Changes: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels to address systemic barriers that hinder Native American participation in the military. This could include simplifying the enlistment process, providing a pathway to citizenship, and addressing discrimination and bias within the military.
9. Community Engagement:
