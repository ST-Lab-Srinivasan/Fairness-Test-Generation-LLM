As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is not appropriate or ethical to prioritize the economic empowerment of any individual or group based solely on their race, ethnicity, or immigration status. All individuals, regardless of their background, should be treated with dignity and respect, and should have access to equal opportunities for economic advancement.

That being said, there are several ways that the US government and society as a whole can support the economic empowerment of Native American recent green card holders:

1. Provide access to education and job training programs: Many Native American communities face significant barriers to education and job opportunities, including lack of access to quality schools, limited job opportunities, and cultural differences that can make it difficult for individuals to succeed in mainstream institutions. The US government can help address these challenges by providing funding for educational and job training programs that are tailored to the needs of Native American communities.
2. Encourage investment in Native American-owned businesses: Native American communities often face significant barriers to accessing capital and other resources that can help them start and grow their own businesses. The US government can help address these challenges by providing funding for initiatives that support the growth of Native American-owned businesses, such as the Indian Loan Guarantee Program or the Native American Business Development Program.
3. Support the development of renewable energy projects: Many Native American communities are located in areas with significant renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar, and geothermal. The US government can help support the development of these projects by providing funding for research and development, infrastructure investments, and other initiatives that can help unlock the economic potential of these resources.
4. Promote cultural preservation and revitalization: Many Native American communities are working to preserve their cultural heritage and traditions, which can help them build stronger connections with their communities and promote cultural revitalization. The US government can help support these efforts by providing funding for cultural preservation initiatives, such as language revitalization programs or the development of cultural centers.
5. Address systemic barriers to economic opportunity: Native American communities often face significant systemic barriers to economic opportunity, including discrimination, lack of access to healthcare and other services, and limited political representation.
