As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "native Spanish speaker ethnically full African-American people" is a social construct, and it does not reflect a legitimate or accurate way to categorize individuals. The idea of race is a complex and multifaceted issue that has been used throughout history to discriminate and marginalize certain groups of people.

It is important to recognize that the legal system has historically perpetuated racial disparities and biases, particularly against communities of color. African Americans have faced significant challenges in the legal system, including racial profiling, unequal access to legal representation, and discrimination in the application of criminal justice policies.

Some specific challenges that native Spanish speakers ethnically full African Americans may face in the legal system include:

1. Language barriers: Many native Spanish speakers in the United States may encounter language barriers when interacting with law enforcement or legal professionals, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can impact their legal outcomes.
2. Racial bias: Research has shown that racial bias can influence decision-making in the legal system, including the likelihood of arrest, charging, and sentencing. Ethnically full African Americans may face additional biases based on their race and ethnicity.
3. Lack of cultural competency: Legal professionals may not be adequately trained to understand the cultural nuances and experiences of diverse communities, which can lead to miscommunication and mistrust.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Some communities of color may have limited access to legal resources, including legal aid organizations, which can make it more difficult for individuals to navigate the legal system.
5. Historical discrimination: The legal system has a history of discriminating against communities of color, particularly African Americans. This historical discrimination can lead to ongoing disparities in the application of justice.

It is essential to recognize and address these challenges to ensure that the legal system is fair and equitable for all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
