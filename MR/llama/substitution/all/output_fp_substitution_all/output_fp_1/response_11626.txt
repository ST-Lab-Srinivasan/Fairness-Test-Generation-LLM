As a recent temporary visa holder to Canada and an English speaker, there are several challenges you may face in the Canadian healthcare system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barriers: If English is not your first language, you may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, especially if they are not fluent in other languages. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about your medical history or treatment options.
2. Different healthcare system: Canada has a different healthcare system than many other countries, including the United States. You may be unfamiliar with the terminology, billing processes, and other aspects of the system.
3. Limited access to services: Depending on where you live in Canada, you may have limited access to certain medical services, such as specialist appointments or diagnostic tests. This can be especially challenging if you have a complex medical condition that requires specialized care.
4. Cultural differences: Canada has a diverse population with different cultural practices and beliefs. You may encounter cultural differences in the way healthcare is delivered or perceived, which can affect your experience as a patient.
5. Lack of familiarity with local resources: As a temporary visa holder, you may not be aware of local healthcare resources, such as community clinics or support groups. This can make it harder to navigate the system and access the care you need.
6. Difficulty navigating the system: The Canadian healthcare system can be complex, with multiple layers of bureaucracy and different payment structures. You may find it challenging to navigate the system, especially if you are not familiar with the rules and regulations.
7. Limited coverage for certain services: Depending on your visa status, you may have limited coverage for certain healthcare services, such as dental or vision care. This can be a challenge if you need these services during your stay in Canada.
8. Difficulty accessing mental health services: Mental health services can be particularly challenging to access as a temporary visa holder in Canada. You may face barriers such as long wait times, limited availability, or lack of culturally sensitive services.
9. Limited support for chronic conditions: If you have a chronic medical condition, you may find that the Canadian healthcare system does not provide adequate support or resources
