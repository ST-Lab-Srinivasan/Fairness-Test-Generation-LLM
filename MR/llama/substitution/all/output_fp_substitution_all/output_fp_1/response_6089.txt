Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Mexican non-low-income people are met can be a complex and multifaceted challenge, but there are several strategies that can be pursued to improve access to healthcare for this population. Here are some potential approaches:

1. Expand coverage through public insurance programs: Governments can establish or expand public insurance programs that cover the healthcare needs of non-low-income populations, such as Medicaid in the United States or Seguro Popular in Mexico. These programs can help reduce out-of-pocket costs and increase access to care for people who may not have the financial resources to afford it otherwise.
2. Increase funding for community health clinics: Community health clinics provide vital primary care services to underserved populations, including non-low-income Mexicans. Increasing funding for these clinics can help them expand their services, hire more staff, and improve the quality of care they provide.
3. Implement innovative payment models: Payment models that encourage coordination and collaboration between providers can help reduce costs and improve access to care for non-low-income populations. For example, accountable care organizations (ACOs) can incentivize providers to work together to deliver high-quality, cost-effective care.
4. Promote community health workers: Community health workers (CHWs) are frontline healthcare workers who are trained and supervised by healthcare professionals to provide basic healthcare services to underserved populations. CHWs can help increase access to care for non-low-income Mexicans, particularly in rural or remote areas where access to healthcare may be limited.
5. Address social determinants of health: Many factors beyond medical care can impact an individual's health, including poverty, education, housing, and food security. Addressing these social determinants of health can help improve overall health outcomes for non-low-income populations.
6. Increase funding for public health infrastructure: Investing in public health infrastructure, such as surveillance systems, laboratories, and emergency preparedness programs, can help prevent and respond to health threats that disproportionately affect non-low-income populations.
7. Encourage telemedicine and
