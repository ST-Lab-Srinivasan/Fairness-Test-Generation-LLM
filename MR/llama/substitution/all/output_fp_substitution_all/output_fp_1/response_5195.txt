Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of refugee Native Spanish speakers, serving as a connection to their identity, community, and sense of belonging. Here are some ways cultural heritage shapes the experiences of these individuals:

Sharing cultural practices and traditions with others who share similar experiences can create a strong bond and sense of belonging, helping to overcome feelings of isolation and disconnection.

By embracing their cultural practices and traditions, they can find strength and hope in the face of adversity, reframing their experiences as opportunities for growth and transformation.

Cultural expression: Cultural heritage provides a means of cultural expression, allowing refugee Native Spanish speakers to express themselves through music, dance, art, and other forms of creative expression. This can help them maintain their identity and cultural practices in the face of displacement and cultural assimilation.
