Promoting the social inclusion of ethnically full African American unemployed communities requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and structural inequalities they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and job training programs: Provide access to quality education and job training programs that cater specifically to the needs of African American communities. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and job placement services.
2. Mentorship and networking opportunities: Connect unemployed African Americans with successful professionals and business owners who can serve as mentors and provide guidance on how to navigate the job market.
3. Community-based initiatives: Develop community-based initiatives that address the unique needs of African American communities, such as financial literacy programs, small business development, and cultural arts programming.
4. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address systemic inequalities faced by African Americans in the job market, such as criminal justice reform, fair housing policies, and equal access to healthcare.
5. Economic empowerment programs: Implement economic empowerment programs that provide financial support and resources to African American-owned businesses, including microloans, grants, and technical assistance.
6. Addressing implicit bias: Provide training and education on implicit bias and cultural competency for employers and hiring managers to help ensure that they are not unintentionally discriminating against African American job seekers.
7. Career fairs and expos: Host career fairs and expos specifically targeting African American job seekers, providing them with access to job opportunities and networking with potential employers.
8. Partnership with community organizations: Collaborate with local community organizations and churches to reach a wider audience of unemployed African Americans and provide them with job training and placement services.
9. Online resources and job boards: Create online resources and job boards specifically targeting African American job seekers, providing them with access to job listings and career opportunities.
10. Addressing structural barriers: Identify and address the structural barriers that prevent African Americans from accessing job opportunities, such as lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, and limited access to technology.
