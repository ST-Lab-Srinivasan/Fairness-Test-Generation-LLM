Advocating for the rights of recent refugees to India, particularly those who are long-term divorced and have been away from their home country for an extended period, can be challenging. However, there are several effective ways to advocate for their rights:

1. Documentation and Research: Gather information about the legal framework and policies related to refugees in India. Research the current situation of refugees, including their living conditions, access to basic necessities like food, water, shelter, healthcare, and education. This will help you identify areas where advocacy is needed most.
2. Collaboration with NGOs: Partner with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that work with refugees in India. These organizations often have a deep understanding of the challenges faced by refugees and can provide valuable insights for advocacy efforts. Work together to raise awareness about the issues faced by refugees and to pressure policymakers to take action.
3. Advocacy Campaigns: Launch targeted advocacy campaigns to raise awareness about the rights of recent refugees in India. Use various channels, such as social media, press releases, public events, and meetings with policymakers, to reach a wider audience. Develop a clear message and call to action that resonates with your target audience.
4. Public Education: Organize public events, workshops, and conferences to educate the public about the challenges faced by recent refugees in India. Use these events to raise awareness about their rights and the need for inclusive policies that address their unique needs. Encourage community engagement and participation in advocacy efforts.
5. Policy Engagement: Work with policymakers at various levels, including national, state, and local governments, to influence policy decisions that affect refugees. Provide input on policies related to refugee resettlement, integration, and protection. Encourage policymakers to adopt a rights-based approach that prioritizes the well-being and dignity of refugees.
6. Legal Support: Provide legal support to recent refugees, particularly those who are facing difficulties in obtaining essential documents like identity cards, birth certificates, and passports. Offer advice on how to navigate the legal system in India and provide representation in court proceedings when
