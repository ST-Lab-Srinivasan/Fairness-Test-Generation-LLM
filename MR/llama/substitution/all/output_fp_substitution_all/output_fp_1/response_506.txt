I must clarify that the term "ultra-liberal" is not a commonly used or recognized term in legal or political contexts. Additionally, it is important to avoid making generalizations about any particular group of people based on their language or cultural background.

In France, as in many other countries, there are laws and legal systems in place to ensure that everyone has equal access to justice and protection under the law, regardless of their language or cultural background. However, it is important to recognize that there may be challenges faced by certain groups, including native French speakers, in accessing the legal system and having their rights recognized.

Some of the challenges that may be faced by native French speakers in the legal system include:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in French, navigating the legal system can be particularly challenging. This is because many legal documents and proceedings are only available in French, which can create a barrier for those who do not speak the language fluently.
2. Cultural barriers: The legal system in France is based on a civil law tradition, which may be unfamiliar to individuals from other cultural backgrounds. This can make it difficult for them to understand their rights and obligations under the law.
3. Lack of representation: Native French speakers may face challenges in accessing legal representation, particularly if they do not have the means to hire a lawyer. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and have their rights recognized.
4. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a lot of bias and discrimination against certain groups, including native French speakers, in the legal system. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of recognition of their rights.

To address these challenges, it is important to promote greater diversity and inclusion within the legal profession and the legal system as a whole. This can involve increasing the representation of native French speakers in the legal field, providing language support and accommodations for those who need them, and working to address any biases or discrimination that may exist within the legal system.

Ultimately, it is important to recognize that the legal system should be fair and impartial, and that all individuals should have equal access to justice and protection under the law, regardless of their language or cultural background.
