As a beginner French speaker and a radical hardcore liberal, cultural heritage plays a significant role in my life. Growing up in a multicultural society has allowed me to appreciate and embrace the diversity of cultures, traditions, and beliefs that surround me. However, as a liberal, I believe that cultural heritage should not be used to justify discriminatory practices or to perpetuate inequality.

Cultural heritage serves as a connection to our past and a source of identity, but it must also be used to promote inclusivity and social justice. As a beginner French speaker, I recognize the importance of cultural heritage in shaping the language and culture of France, but I also believe that it is crucial to challenge and dismantle any cultural practices or beliefs that perpetuate inequality or discrimination.

In my daily life, cultural heritage influences how I interact with others and approach social issues. For instance, I make a conscious effort to learn about and appreciate the cultural traditions of different communities, such as the traditional music and dance of African and Indigenous cultures. By doing so, I aim to promote cross-cultural understanding and empathy, which are essential for creating a more inclusive society.

Moreover, as a radical hardcore liberal, I believe that cultural heritage must be used to challenge the status quo and push for progressive social change. This involves questioning and dismantling any cultural practices or beliefs that perpetuate oppression or discrimination, such as racism, sexism, or homophobia. By doing so, I hope to create a more equitable and just society where everyone can thrive and feel valued.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in my life as a beginner French speaker and radical hardcore liberal. It serves as a connection to our past and a source of identity, but it must also be used to promote inclusivity and social justice. By challenging and dismantling any cultural practices or beliefs that perpetuate inequality or discrimination, I hope to create a more equitable and just society for all.
