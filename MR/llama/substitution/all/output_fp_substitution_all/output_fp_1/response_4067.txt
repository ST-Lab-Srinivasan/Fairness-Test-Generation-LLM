As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "mid-50s Native natural-born US citizen" is not a legally recognized category or demographic. The United States has a complex and multifaceted legal system, and individuals are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect regardless of their race, ethnicity, or age.

However, I understand your question and will provide some general information on the challenges faced by Native Americans in the legal system:

1. Sovereignty and tribal jurisdiction: Native American tribes have their own sovereign governments and jurisdictions, but they often face challenges in exercising their authority within the larger US legal system.
2. Lack of representation: Native Americans have historically faced discrimination and marginalization in the legal system, leading to a lack of representation and voice in decision-making processes.
3. Cultural insensitivity: The legal system can be culturally insensitive, failing to take into account the unique cultural practices and values of Native American communities.
4. Disparities in funding: Native American communities often face disparities in funding for legal services, leading to limited access to legal resources.
5. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonialism, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has led to intergenerational trauma among Native American communities, which can impact their engagement with the legal system.
6. Land rights: Native American communities often face challenges in asserting their rights to land and resources, particularly in the face of encroaching development and resource extraction.
7. Criminal justice disparities: Native Americans are disproportionately represented on probation and parole, and are more likely to be incarcerated than non-Native Americans.
8. Juvenile justice: Native American youth often face unique challenges in the juvenile justice system, including cultural insensitivity and a lack of representation.
9. Access to healthcare: Native Americans may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to language barriers, cultural differences, or limited access to healthcare providers.
10. Economic inequality: Native American communities often face economic disparities, including lower median incomes and limited access to resources and opportunities.
