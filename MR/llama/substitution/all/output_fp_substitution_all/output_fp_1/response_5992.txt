Creating more inclusive housing policies for late pregnancy (3rd trimester) long-time divorced individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach that takes into account their unique needs and challenges. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive housing policies:

1. Accommodate Pregnancy: Housing providers should accommodate pregnant women by providing flexible lease terms, such as temporary reductions or extensions in lease duration. This can help ensure that the woman has enough time to recover after giving birth and adjust to her new role as a single parent.
2. Flexible Payment Plans: Offer flexible payment plans that take into account the financial challenges faced by pregnant women, particularly those who are single parents. This could include temporary reductions in rent or utility payments during the postpartum period.
3. Prioritize Accessibility: Ensure that housing units are accessible and safe for pregnant women, particularly those with mobility issues. Install handrails, widen doorways, and provide adequate lighting to make it easier for women to move around during their third trimester.
4. Support Services: Provide support services, such as prenatal care, postpartum care, and parenting classes, to help pregnant women navigate the challenges of pregnancy and single parenthood. This could also include mental health counseling and financial planning resources.
5. Childcare Support: Offer on-site or nearby childcare services to help pregnant women who are single parents manage their daily responsibilities while ensuring their baby's well-being. This could include drop-in childcare, nanny shares, or referrals to local daycares.
6. Community Outreach: Engage with local community organizations and resources that can provide additional support to pregnant women who are single parents. This could include parenting classes, job training programs, and legal aid services.
7. Advocacy: Advocate for policies that address the unique challenges faced by pregnant women who are single parents, such as paid family leave, affordable childcare, and access to healthcare. Housing providers can work with local policymakers and advocacy groups to push for systemic change.
8. Education and Training:
