Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Mixed Hispanic Heritage Nominal Christian Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals from mixed Hispanic heritage backgrounds, especially those who identify as nominal Christians. This group faces a unique identity crisis due to their dual cultural and religious backgrounds. This paper aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and how they navigate their religious and cultural identities.

This can lead to a sense of identity crisis or confusion about their religious identity (Hurtado, 2013).
2. Language and Cultural Expression: The language and cultural expression of mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may be influenced by multiple cultures, leading to a blending of languages and cultural practices (Garcia, 2017). This can create a unique identity that is distinct from both cultures but also connected to them.
3. Food and Celebrations: The foods and celebrations of mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may reflect the cultural influences of their ancestors, such as traditional Spanish dishes and indigenous festivals (Krauss, 2017). This can create a sense of belonging to multiple cultures and religions.
