Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers from an ethnically diverse background, specifically Hispanic individuals, requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more welcoming and engaging:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for your staff and volunteers to help them understand the needs and preferences of diverse communities. This can include learning about different cultures, religions, and customs.
2. Bilingual programming: Offer bilingual programming to cater to English language learners. This could include providing interpretive services during events or offering bilingual educational materials.
3. Inclusive marketing: Develop marketing strategies that are inclusive of diverse communities. Use language and imagery that resonates with your target audience, and avoid stereotypes or cultural appropriation.
4. Community outreach: Reach out to local ethnic organizations and community groups to build partnerships and gather input on how to make your programs more inclusive. This can help you identify specific needs and preferences of the Hispanic community.
5. Accessibility: Ensure that your programs are accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, braille materials, or audio descriptions.
6. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate different work schedules and family obligations. For example, you could offer programs during the day or evening, or provide online content that can be accessed at any time.
7. Cross-cultural dialogue: Encourage cross-cultural dialogue by incorporating diverse perspectives into your programming. This can include inviting guest speakers from different cultures to share their experiences and insights.
8. Adaptable content: Develop content that is adaptable to different learning styles and abilities. Use a variety of teaching methods, such as visual aids, hands-on activities, and interactive discussions, to engage learners.
9. Cultural events: Host cultural events that celebrate the diversity of your community. This could include festivals, parades, or other events that promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation.
10. Feedback mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input
