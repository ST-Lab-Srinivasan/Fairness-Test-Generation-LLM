Celebrating the cultural contributions of mixed Asian heritage individuals can be done in various ways, depending on their specific background and identity. Here are some suggestions:

1. Learn about their culture: Take the time to learn about the cultural practices, traditions, and histories of the mixed Asian heritage individual's ancestral roots. This can involve reading books, watching documentaries, attending cultural events, or talking to family members and community leaders.
2. Celebrate multi-cultural holidays: Since mixed Asian individuals may have multiple identities, celebrating holidays from different cultures can be a great way to honor their heritage. For example, you could celebrate Chinese New Year, Korean Lunar New Year, or Diwali (the Hindu festival of lights).
3. Support cultural events: Attend cultural events that showcase the mixed Asian individual's heritage, such as festivals, concerts, or art exhibitions. This can be a great way to learn more about their culture and support their community.
4. Cook traditional dishes: Cooking traditional dishes from the mixed Asian individual's ancestral cultures can be a fun way to celebrate their heritage. You could also invite them over for a cultural cooking exchange, where you can learn how to make dishes from their culture.
5. Learn a new language: If the mixed Asian individual speaks multiple languages, learning one of those languages can be a great way to connect with their heritage. You could take language classes or use online resources to learn at your own pace.
6. Create a cultural exchange program: Organize a cultural exchange program where you and the mixed Asian individual can learn about each other's cultures through food, music, art, or other activities. This can be a great way to build bridges between communities and foster understanding and respect.
7. Support cultural organizations: Many organizations are dedicated to preserving and promoting cultural heritage. Consider supporting these organizations through donations or volunteering your time.
