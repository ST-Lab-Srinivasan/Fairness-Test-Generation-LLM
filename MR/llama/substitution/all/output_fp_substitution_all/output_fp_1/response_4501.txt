During the third trimester of pregnancy, women may face a variety of challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Access to care: Women in rural or underserved areas may have limited access to prenatal care, leading to potential complications during pregnancy and delivery.

3. Lack of provider knowledge: Providers may not have the necessary training or experience to address the unique needs of pregnant individuals, particularly those with complex medical histories or multiple gestations.
4. Insurance barriers: Women may encounter difficulties in obtaining adequate insurance coverage for prenatal care and delivery, which can limit their access to care.
5. Cultural and religious beliefs: Women may face challenges in navigating the healthcare system due to cultural or religious beliefs that conflict with medical recommendations or procedures.
6. Fear of judgment: Women may feel uncomfortable discussing their pregnancy or seeking medical care due to fear of being judged or stigmatized based on their political views or other aspects of their identity.

9. Language barriers: Women who are non-native English speakers may encounter difficulties communicating with providers due to language barriers.
