As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression, have the right to receive appropriate and inclusive healthcare. Here are some ways to ensure that the healthcare needs of physically able-bodied infant gender-fluid people are met:

1. Provide access to gender-affirming care: Gender-fluid infants should have access to medical professionals who are knowledgeable and supportive of their specific healthcare needs. This includes hormone therapy, if applicable, and regular check-ins with a gender-affirming pediatrician or primary care physician.
2. Offer inclusive well-child visits: During well-child visits, medical providers should ask about the infant's gender identity and expression, and provide age-appropriate information on gender-related topics. This can help build trust and create a safe environment for the child and their family.
3. Address mental health needs: Gender-fluid infants may experience anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues due to societal stigma or lack of understanding. Healthcare providers should be trained to recognize these issues and provide appropriate mental health services, such as counseling or therapy.
4. Encourage parental involvement: Engaging parents in their child's healthcare can help them better understand and support their gender identity. Providers should offer resources and information on how to create a supportive environment for their gender-fluid child.
5. Advocate for policies that support gender-affirming care: Healthcare providers can advocate for policies that promote inclusive and affirming care for all patients, including those who are gender-fluid. This may involve working with insurance companies to cover gender-affirming treatments or pushing for legislative changes that protect the rights of gender-nonconforming individuals.
6. Foster a culture of respect and inclusivity: Healthcare providers should strive to create a welcoming and respectful environment for all patients, regardless of their gender identity or expression. This can involve educating staff on LGBTQ+ issues, using inclusive language, and promoting diversity and cultural competency in the workplace.
7. Provide education and resources: Offering educational materials
