Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for leftist partnered individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve marginalized communities in the planning process: Ensure that the voices and perspectives of marginalized communities, such as people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and individuals with disabilities, are included in the planning process. This can be done by actively seeking out diverse perspectives and incorporating them into the decision-making process.
2. Challenge traditional cultural norms: Examine the cultural celebrations that are traditionally celebrated and challenge any biases or discrimination that may exist within them. For example, consider alternative gender roles or ways of expressing cultural identity beyond the traditional masculine/feminine binary.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a sense of belonging for all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or cultural background. This can be done by promoting inclusivity and respect for diverse perspectives, and by creating opportunities for people to connect and build relationships with one another.
4. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to educate yourself and others about the experiences and challenges faced by marginalized communities. This can help to promote empathy and understanding, and can also help to dismantle harmful stereotypes and biases.
5. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use language and terminology that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their cultural background or political beliefs. Avoid using language that is offensive or marginalizing, and be willing to adapt your language and terminology as needed.
6. Incorporate diverse perspectives and traditions: Incorporate diverse perspectives and traditions into cultural celebrations, such as incorporating indigenous music, dance, or art into a cultural festival. This can help to promote cultural exchange and understanding, and can also help to challenge dominant cultural narratives.
7. Prioritize accessibility: Ensure that cultural celebrations are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. This can be done by providing accommodations such as sign language interpretation, wheelchair accessibility, or braille materials.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play
