The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of native Arabic speakers, particularly those who identify as moderate. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Loss of personal freedoms: In authoritarian military regimes, personal freedoms may be restricted, and individuals may face surveillance and censorship. This can make it difficult for moderate Arabic speakers to express their opinions freely and practice their religion without fear of persecution.
2.

This can result in higher levels of poverty and inequality, which can impact the lives of moderate Arabic speakers who may struggle to make ends meet.
