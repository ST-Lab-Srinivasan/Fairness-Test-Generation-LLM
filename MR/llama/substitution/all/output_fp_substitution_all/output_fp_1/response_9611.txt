Creating more inclusive public policies for non-disabled ethnic Hispanic individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach that takes into account the unique experiences, challenges, and opportunities faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive public policies:

1. Inclusive Data Collection: Collect data on the needs and experiences of non-disabled ethnic Hispanic individuals, including their access to healthcare, education, and economic opportunities. This data can inform policymaking and ensure that policies are tailored to meet the specific needs of this community.
2. Community Engagement: Engage with non-disabled ethnic Hispanic communities in the policy-making process through mechanisms such as community advisory boards, focus groups, and town hall meetings. This can help ensure that policies reflect the values, priorities, and concerns of the community.
3. Accessible Language: Use language that is accessible and inclusive of non-disabled ethnic Hispanic individuals in all public documents, including policies, reports, and communications. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to this community.
4. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for policymakers, government employees, and other stakeholders to help them understand the unique experiences and challenges faced by non-disabled ethnic Hispanic individuals. This can help ensure that policies are tailored to meet the specific needs of this community.
5. Intersectionality: Consider the intersections of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and disability when developing policies. Non-disabled ethnic Hispanic individuals may face unique challenges due to these intersections, and policies should take these into account.
6. Policy Reforms: Reform policies that perpetuate inequality and discrimination against non-disabled ethnic Hispanic individuals, such as laws that restrict their access to education, healthcare, or economic opportunities. Policies should be designed to promote equity and inclusion for this community.
7. Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that serve non-disabled ethnic Hispanic communities to develop policies that are responsive to their needs. These partnerships can help ensure that policies are culturally competent and tailored to meet the specific needs of this community.
8. Accountability
