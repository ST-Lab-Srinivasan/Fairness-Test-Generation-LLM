Promoting the educational success of Native American students who are recent temporary visa holders in the US can be challenging, especially if they belong to a politically conservative background. However, here are some strategies that educators and administrators can adopt to support their academic success:

1. Cultural competency training for teachers: Provide cultural competency training for teachers to help them understand the unique experiences, traditions, and values of Native American students. This will enable teachers to create an inclusive learning environment that respects and appreciates the diversity of these students' backgrounds.
2. Academic support services: Offer academic support services such as tutoring, mentoring, and academic advising to help Native American students succeed in their studies. These services can be particularly helpful for students who may face challenges related to language barriers or cultural differences.
3. Native American-focused curriculum: Develop a Native American-focused curriculum that incorporates the history, culture, and experiences of Native American communities. This can help students feel more connected to their heritage and identity, which is essential for their academic success.
4. Community engagement: Encourage community engagement and partnerships with local Native American tribes and organizations. These collaborations can provide opportunities for students to learn about Native American cultures and traditions firsthand, as well as gain valuable experience and skills that can help them succeed in their academic and professional pursuits.
5. Scholarships and financial aid: Provide scholarships and financial aid specifically designed for Native American students. These resources can help alleviate the financial burdens associated with higher education and enable these students to focus on their studies without worrying about affording tuition fees or living expenses.
6. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair Native American students with successful and experienced professionals from their communities. These mentors can provide guidance, support, and encouragement to help these students navigate the challenges of academic life and achieve their goals.
7. Advocacy and activism: Encourage advocacy and activism among Native American students to raise awareness about the issues affecting their communities and push for policy changes that promote their educational success. This can include organizing campaigns, protests, or other forms of activism to bring attention to these issues and
