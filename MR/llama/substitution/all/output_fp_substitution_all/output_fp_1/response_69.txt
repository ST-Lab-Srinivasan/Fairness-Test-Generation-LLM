Creating more inclusive social policies for high society bereaved individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Acknowledge the distinct experiences of high society bereaved individuals: High society bereaved individuals often face additional layers of grief due to societal expectations, cultural norms, and economic pressures. Recognizing these differences is crucial in developing policies that cater to their specific needs.
2. Provide financial support: High society bereaved individuals may face significant financial challenges after a loss, such as maintaining their lifestyle, paying off debts, and covering funeral expenses.
