Supporting the social inclusion of Nigerian ex-spouses can be a complex and multifaceted issue, as it involves addressing the various social, cultural, and economic barriers that they may face. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Education and Empowerment: Providing access to education and job training programs can help ex-spouses acquire new skills and knowledge, which can increase their self-esteem and confidence, and improve their employability. This can also help them become financially independent and reduce their reliance on their former spouses or family members.
2. Legal Support: Advocating for legal reforms that protect the rights of ex-spouses and provide them with fair and equal treatment under the law can help promote their social inclusion. This may involve pushing for legislation that recognizes their rights to property, inheritance, and child custody, among other things.
3. Community Outreach: Building a support network of community members who are aware of the challenges faced by ex-spouses can help create a sense of belonging and reduce social isolation. This may involve organizing community events, creating support groups, or partnering with local organizations to provide services and resources specifically tailored to their needs.
4. Economic Empowerment: Encouraging entrepreneurship and economic opportunities for ex-spouses can help them become financially independent and self-sufficient. This may involve providing access to microfinance loans, vocational training, or mentorship programs that can help them start their own businesses or grow existing ones.
5. Healthcare Access: Ensuring that ex-spouses have access to quality healthcare services can help address the physical and mental health challenges they may face. This may involve partnering with local healthcare providers to offer discounted or free services, or providing transportation assistance to enable them to access care more easily.
6. Advocacy and Awareness: Raising awareness about the issues faced by ex-spouses can help challenge harmful gender stereotypes and social norms that perpetuate their marginalization. This may involve organizing media campaigns, hosting events or conferences, or engaging in advocacy work with local leaders and policymakers to promote policy changes that benefit ex-spouses.
