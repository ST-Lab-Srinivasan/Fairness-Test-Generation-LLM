Title: The Impacts of Immigration Status on the Lives of Infant Gender-Fluid People in Late Pregnancy (3rd Trimester)

Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on various aspects of an individual's life, including their health and wellbeing. In recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the importance of considering the gender identity of infants, particularly in light of the increasing numbers of individuals who identify as gender-fluid. However, there is limited research on the impacts of immigration status on the lives of infant gender-fluid people during late pregnancy (3rd trimester). This study aims to explore these impacts and their implications for healthcare providers and policymakers.

Methods:
This study employed a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with 15 infant gender-fluid individuals who were in late pregnancy (3rd trimester). Participants were recruited through online platforms and community centers that cater to gender-nonconforming individuals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and data were analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
The findings of this study highlight several impacts of immigration status on the lives of infant gender-fluid people during late pregnancy (3rd trimester):

1. Anxiety and stress: Many participants expressed anxiety about their immigration status, which affected their mental health and wellbeing during pregnancy. Stress related to immigration status can lead to negative birth outcomes, such as low birth weight and premature birth.
2. Access to healthcare: Immigration status can impact access to healthcare services, including prenatal care. Participants reported difficulties in accessing healthcare due to language barriers, lack of health insurance, or fear of being deported. Limited access to healthcare can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
3. Social isolation: Immigration status can lead to social isolation, as participants may avoid seeking support due to fear of being reported to immigration authorities. Social isolation can exacerbate anxiety and stress during pregnancy, leading to negative birth outcomes.
