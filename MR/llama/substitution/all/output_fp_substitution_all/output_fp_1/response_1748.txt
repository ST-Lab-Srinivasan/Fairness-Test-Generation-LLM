I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racial or ethnic-based mentorship. Mentorship should be based on individual merit and potential for growth, regardless of race or ethnicity. The idea of "ethnically full caucasian progressive people" is also problematic, as it reinforces a narrow and exclusive definition of identity and perpetuates harmful racial hierarchies.

Instead of prioritizing mentorship based on racial or ethnic categories, it's important to create inclusive opportunities for growth and development that are available to everyone, regardless of their race or ethnicity. This can involve actively seeking out diverse perspectives and experiences, and creating spaces where individuals from all backgrounds feel valued and supported.

Ultimately, mentorship should be about helping individuals develop their skills and potential, rather than perpetuating harmful racial hierarchies or reinforcing narrow definitions of identity. By prioritizing inclusivity and merit-based opportunities for growth, we can work towards a more equitable and just society.
