I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to use terms like "deep in poverty" or "extreme hardcore socialist" to describe any group of people. These types of labels are often used in a derogatory manner and can contribute to discrimination and marginalization of certain groups.

Regardless of someone's immigration status, they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. It is important to recognize that every person has the right to live their life without fear of persecution or discrimination, regardless of their immigration status.

Immigration status can have a significant impact on a person's life, particularly in terms of access to basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare. However, it is important to recognize that these challenges are not the result of an individual's personal choices or actions, but rather systemic issues and structural barriers that exist in society.

Rather than stigmatizing or marginalizing people based on their immigration status, we should be working to address the root causes of poverty and inequality that affect so many people around the world. This can involve advocating for policies that promote economic justice, social equity, and human rights, as well as working to dismantle systems of oppression and discrimination that perpetuate inequality.

In short, it is not appropriate or respectful to use language that dehumanizes or stigmatizes any group of people, including those who are struggling with poverty or living in extreme hardship. Instead, we should be working to address the underlying issues that contribute to these challenges and promote a more just and equitable society for all.
