The impact of immigration status on the lives of just-above-poverty-line liberal people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Uncertainty and Insecurity: The constant fear of deportation, detention, or legal troubles can create a sense of insecurity and uncertainty among immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented. This can affect their mental health, relationships, and overall well-being.
2. Limited Access to Services: Immigrants, especially those without legal status, may face barriers when accessing essential services such as healthcare, education, and social welfare programs. They may be hesitant to seek help due to fear of revealing their immigration status or encountering discrimination.
3. Financial Stress: Immigrants may struggle to make ends meet due to limited access to financial resources, jobs, and benefits. This can lead to financial insecurity, debt, and stress, which can further exacerbate existing poverty.
4. Social Isolationation: The stigma surrounding immigration status can lead to social isolation, making it difficult for individuals to form connections and build relationships within their communities. This can result in feelings of loneliness, disconnection, and depression.
5. Lack of Representation: Immigrants may feel marginalized and unrepresented in political processes, leading to a lack of voice in shaping policies that affect their lives. This can further perpetuate systemic inequality and discrimination.
6. Health Disparities: Limited access to healthcare and other resources due to immigration status can result in poorer health outcomes and increased disparities for marginalized communities.
7. Family Separation: The fear of deportation or separation from family members can cause significant emotional distress, particularly for those with dependents who are citizens or legal residents. This can lead to anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
8. Lack of Empowerment: Immigrants may feel powerless to advocate for their rights or challenge systemic inequalities due to fear of retribution or lack of access to resources. This can perpetuate marginalization and limit opportunities for social mobility.
