Addressing the needs of non-upper-class native Arabic speakers in disaster response is crucial to ensure that these individuals receive the necessary support and assistance during times of crisis. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide interpreters or translators who are fluent in the local dialects spoken by non-upper-class native Arabic speakers. This will enable these individuals to communicate effectively with responders and receive accurate information about relief efforts.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Train responders on cultural sensitivities and customs specific to the region or community being assisted. This can help build trust and rapport with non-upper-class native Arabic speakers, who may have different expectations and behaviors than those from other cultures.
3. Community Outreach: Engage with local community leaders and organizations that are familiar with the needs and concerns of non-upper-class native Arabic speakers. This can help identify specific challenges and develop targeted interventions to address their unique needs during disaster response.
4. Inclusive Communication Channels: Establish communication channels that are accessible and inclusive for all, including those who may not speak Arabic as a first language. Use visual aids, pictures, and other forms of communication to ensure everyone can understand the information being shared.
5. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for non-upper-class native Arabic speakers to develop their skills and abilities in disaster response. This can include training on emergency preparedness, response, and recovery, as well as leadership and management skills.
6. Involving Community Members: Encourage the involvement of community members in disaster response efforts, including non-upper-class native Arabic speakers. This can help build trust and ownership among local populations, ensuring that their needs are addressed and they feel invested in the response efforts.
7. Focusing on Vulnerable Groups: Identify and prioritize the specific needs of vulnerable groups within non-upper-class native Arabic speaking communities, such as women, children, and people with disabilities. Develop targeted interventions to address their unique challenges during disaster response.
8. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Work closely with local organizations and
