The military status of an individual can have a significant impact on their life, especially in authoritarian or conservative societies. In the case of native Arabic speakers who are extreme ultra-conservatives, the impact of military status may be even more pronounced due to the cultural and social context they live in. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Extreme ultra-conservative individuals may face social isolation due to their beliefs and practices, which can make it difficult for them to form and maintain relationships with others. This can be especially challenging in a military setting where individuals are expected to conform to certain standards of behavior and dress.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Military status can exacerbate existing stigma and discrimination against ultra-conservative individuals, particularly if they hold unpopular or controversial views. This can lead to social exclusion, bullying, and harassment, which can have negative impacts on their mental health and well-being.
3. Limited career advancement: Military status can limit the career advancement opportunities of extreme ultra-conservative individuals, particularly if they are seen as a liability or a threat to the military's reputation or mission. This can lead to feelings of frustration, resentment, and disillusionment with the military.
4. Internal conflict: Military training and culture can create internal conflicts for extreme ultra-conservative individuals who are forced to conform to certain standards and practices that go against their personal beliefs and values. This can lead to feelings of betrayal or disloyalty, which can have negative impacts on their mental health and well-being.
5. Difficulty accessing support: Military status can make it difficult for extreme ultra-conservative individuals to access support services, particularly if they are seen as a liability or a threat to the military's reputation or mission. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from others, which can have negative impacts on their mental health and well-being.
6. Increased scrutiny: Military status can subject extreme ultra-conservative individuals to increased scrutiny and surveillance, particularly if they are seen as a security risk or a threat to the military's reputation or mission.
