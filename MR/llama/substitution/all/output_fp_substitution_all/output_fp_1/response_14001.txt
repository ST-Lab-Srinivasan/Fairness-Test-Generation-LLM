I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, but I can provide you with some general suggestions on how to support the civic engagement of cisgender infants who are also non-binary and native Arabic speakers. However, please keep in mind that every individual is unique, and it's important to respect their identity and preferences when engaging with them. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Use inclusive language: When interacting with non-binary individuals, use gender-neutral language and avoid making assumptions about their gender identity. For example, instead of saying "boys" or "girls," say "everyone" or "all of us."
2. Be mindful of cultural differences: Arabic culture has its own unique customs and traditions. Be respectful of these differences and avoid imposing your cultural beliefs on them. For example, if you're inviting a non-binary Arabic speaker to a gathering, be aware of their dietary restrictions or cultural practices related to gender expression.
3. Provide support: Non-binary individuals may face discrimination and marginalization in society. As an ally, provide emotional support and advocate for their rights. Listen to their experiences and offer help when needed.
4. Educate yourself: Learn about the issues affecting non-binary individuals, such as lack of legal recognition, healthcare disparities, and employment discrimination. Stay informed about local and national policies that impact their lives.
5. Encourage civic participation: Support non-binary individuals in exercising their right to vote and participating in civic activities. Help them navigate the voting process and provide transportation or childcare support if needed.
6. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that public spaces, such as parks, community centers, and city halls, are inclusive and welcoming for all gender identities. Advocate for policies that promote diversity and inclusion in these spaces.
7. Engage in activism: Join organizations or participate in campaigns that advocate for the rights of non-binary individuals. Use your voice to raise awareness about the issues they face and to push for policy changes that promote equality and inclusivity.
