I must clarify that the term "lower middle-income hardcore socialist people" is a subjective and potentially problematic label. It is important to recognize that individuals with varying socioeconomic backgrounds and political beliefs are not inherently inferior or superior to one another. Rather, they are unique individuals with their own experiences, perspectives, and contributions to society.

That being said, here are some ways to support the social inclusion of individuals from lower-income backgrounds who identify as socialists:

1. Economic empowerment: Provide access to education, job training, and economic opportunities to help individuals acquire the skills and resources needed to improve their socioeconomic status.
2. Affordable healthcare: Ensure that everyone has access to quality, affordable healthcare, regardless of their income level or social status. This can help reduce financial stress and improve overall well-being.
3. Social safety nets: Implement policies that provide a safety net for individuals who are struggling financially or socially, such as food assistance programs, housing subsidies, or mental health services.
4. Community engagement: Encourage community involvement and participation in decision-making processes to help ensure that the voices of marginalized groups are heard and represented.
5. Anti-discrimination policies: Implement policies that protect individuals from discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or other factors. This can help create a more inclusive and equitable society.
6. Cultural exchange programs: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring together individuals from different backgrounds to share experiences, learn from one another, and foster mutual understanding and respect.
7. Mentorship opportunities: Provide mentorship opportunities for individuals from lower-income backgrounds to connect with successful professionals or entrepreneurs who can offer guidance and support in their personal and professional lives.
8. Access to technology: Ensure that everyone has access to technology, including computers, smartphones, and internet connectivity, to bridge the digital divide and provide equal opportunities for learning and communication.
9. Political representation: Encourage and support individuals from marginalized groups to run for political office or participate in decision-making processes at the local, national, or international level
