In 1870, cultural exchange played a significant role in fostering understanding between actively equal homosexual active-duty groups. During this time, there were various forms of cultural exchange that took place between different social and political groups, including those who identified as LGBTQ+. These exchanges helped to promote mutual understanding, respect, and empathy among the different groups involved.

One notable example of cultural exchange in 1870 was the formation of the "Society for the Suppression of Unnatural Crimes," which was a group of activists who sought to address the criminalization of homosexuality. This society brought together individuals from different backgrounds and experiences, including law enforcement officials, medical professionals, and LGBTQ+ advocates. Through their shared efforts, they were able to raise awareness about the issue of criminalization and work towards its eventual abolition.

Another example of cultural exchange in 1870 was the development of the "Golden Age" of LGBTQ+ literature, which saw a proliferation of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction works that explored themes of same-sex desire and identity. This literary movement helped to create a sense of community and shared experience among LGBTQ+ individuals, as well as to challenge societal norms and expectations around gender and sexuality.

Cultural exchange also played a role in the formation of LGBTQ+ organizations and support groups. For example, the "Society for Human Rights," which was founded in Chicago in 1924, provided a space for LGBTQ+ individuals to gather, socialize, and seek support from one another. This organization helped to foster a sense of belonging and community among its members, and it also served as a platform for advocating for LGBTQ+ rights and challenging discriminatory laws and practices.

Overall, cultural exchange played a significant role in fostering understanding between actively equal homosexual active-duty groups in 1870. Through shared experiences, mutual respect, and cooperative efforts, these groups were able to build bridges of understanding and create a sense of community and solidarity that continues to this day.
