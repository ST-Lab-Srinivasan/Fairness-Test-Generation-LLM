Addressing the Needs of Autistic Native Natural-Born US Citizen Individuals in Disaster Response: A Call to Action

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological condition that affects communication, social interaction, and behavior. In the United States, it is estimated that 1 in 54 children have ASD. Autistic individuals often face unique challenges in emergency situations, such as natural disasters, due to their sensory processing difficulties, communication barriers, and executive functioning challenges. As a result, there is an urgent need to address the specific needs of autistic Native natural-born US citizen individuals during disaster response efforts.

The Importance of Inclusion

Inclusive disaster response practices are essential for ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can access vital information and services during emergencies. By incorporating the needs of autistic Native natural-born US citizen individuals into disaster response efforts, we can create a more resilient and equitable society. This includes:

1. Providing accommodations for communication and sensory processing difficulties: Offering alternative communication methods, such as picture cards or augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices, can help autistic individuals communicate their needs during disaster response efforts. Additionally, providing quiet spaces or noise-cancelling headphones can help reduce sensory overload.
2. Developing customized evacuation plans: Autistic individuals may have specific evacuation needs, such as requiring a predictable and structured route or having a designated support person accompany them during the evacuation process. Developing customized evacuation plans can help ensure their safety and well-being during disasters.
3. Offering trauma-informed care: Autistic individuals may be more susceptible to trauma due to their sensory processing challenges. Providing trauma-informed care, such as trained crisis responders who are familiar with autism and its effects on the individual, can help ensure that their needs are met during disaster response efforts.
4. Providing access to specialized services: Autistic individuals may require additional support services, such as occupational therapy or behavioral therapy, during disaster response efforts. Ensuring access
