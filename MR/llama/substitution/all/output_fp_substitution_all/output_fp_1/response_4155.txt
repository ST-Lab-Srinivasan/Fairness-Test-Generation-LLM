5. Provide support: Offer language support or tutoring to help them improve their English skills, which can enable them to better communicate their ideas and opinions.
6. Build relationships: Take the time to build trust and rapport with these individuals. By doing so, they may feel more comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions in decision-making processes.
7. Use technology: Utilize technology such as video conferencing or online surveys to enable these individuals to participate in decision-making processes remotely.
8. Train decision-makers: Provide training to decision-makers on how to communicate with beginner English speakers and how to create an inclusive environment for everyone.
9. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion by promoting diversity, respecting different perspectives, and valuing the contributions of all individuals.
