As a non-citizen not lifelong married person, there are several challenges that I face in the healthcare system:

1. Access to healthcare: As a non-citizen, I may not have access to the same healthcare benefits as citizens. This can make it difficult for me to receive the medical care I need, especially if I do not have a stable source of income or insurance.
2. Language barriers: Depending on where I live and the language spoken in that area, I may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers who speak different languages. This can make it difficult for me to understand my diagnosis, treatment options, and other important medical information.
3. Cultural barriers: As a non-citizen, I may have cultural beliefs or practices that are not aligned with the healthcare system in the country where I reside. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications with healthcare providers, which can result in suboptimal care.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-citizens may face discrimination in the healthcare system based on their immigration status. This can result in delayed or denied access to medical care, which can have serious consequences for my health and well-being.
5. Lack of trust: As a non-citizen, I may not feel comfortable seeking medical care from providers who are unfamiliar with my cultural background or language barriers. This can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system, which can result in delayed or avoided medical care.
6. Limited access to specialized care: As a non-citizen, I may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cancer treatment or organ transplants. This can be especially challenging if I need urgent or emergency medical care that is not available in my area.
7. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: As a non-citizen, I may find it difficult to navigate the healthcare system, including understanding how to access care, finding providers who speak my language, and dealing with billing and insurance issues.
8. Limited legal rights: As a non-citizen, I may have limited legal rights in the healthcare system, which can make it difficult for me to advocate for myself or seek redress if I experience poor care
