Creating more inclusive social policies for elite ex-spouses requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Define Elite Ex-Spouses: The first step is to define who qualifies as an elite ex-spouse. This could include individuals who were married to highly successful or wealthy individuals, such as CEOs, entrepreneurs, athletes, or celebrities.

	* Difficulty accessing support systems and resources due to their ex-spouse's fame or wealth
3. Provide Financial Support: Elite ex-spouses may struggle to maintain their financial security after a divorce, particularly if they were financially dependent on their spouse during the marriage. Policies could provide financial support, such as:

4. Offer Mental Health Support: Divorce can be emotionally challenging for anyone, but it can be especially difficult for elite ex-spouses who may have experienced high levels of stress and pressure during their marriage. Policies could provide mental health support, such as:

	* Teletherapy options for those with busy schedules or mobility issues
	* Online resources and support groups for elite ex-spouses

	* Networking events or workshops for elite ex-spouses to connect with others in similar situations
