Title: The Impact of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Physically Disabled Nigerians

Introduction:
Physically disabled individuals in Nigeria face numerous challenges, including social stigma, lack of accessibility, and limited opportunities for education and employment. However, their political affiliation can also have a significant impact on their lives. This study examines the experiences of physically disabled Nigerians based on their political affiliations and explores the implications of these experiences on their well-being and quality of life.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that disabled individuals in Nigeria face discrimination and marginalization, which can lead to social isolation, depression, and reduced life expectancy (Adewuyi et al., 2015). However, research on the impact of political affiliation on the lives of physically disabled Nigerians is limited.

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with 20 physically disabled Nigerians who belong to different political affiliations. Participants were selected purposively based on their political affiliations and disability status. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically.

Findings:
Four themes emerged from the data analysis: (1) Social Isolation and Stigma, (2) Limited Access to Education and Employment, (3) Political Exclusion and Marginalization, and (4) Resilience and Activism.

Social Isolation and Stigma: Disabled individuals who belong to political parties face social isolation due to the stigma associated with disability in Nigerian society. Participants reported feeling ashamed of their disability and experiencing discrimination from party members and the general public.

Limited Access to Education and Employment: Disabled individuals face significant barriers to accessing education and employment opportunities, regardless of their political affiliation. Participants reported difficulty in finding employment due to their disability status and lack of accommodations in the workplace.

Political Exclusion and Marginalization: Disabled individuals who belong to political parties are often excluded from party decision-making processes and policy development. This marginalization can lead to a lack of representation and voice for disabled individuals in the political sphere
