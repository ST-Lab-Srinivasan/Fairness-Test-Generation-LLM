Introduction:
Disability is a complex and multifaceted concept that affects individuals in various ways. In this study, we aim to explore the impact of disability status on the lives of Native English Speaker (NES) people who are carriers of genetic conditions. We will examine the effects of disability on their social, emotional, and economic well-being, as well as their experiences with healthcare systems.

Methods:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, employing in-depth interviews with NES people who are carriers of genetic conditions. Participants will be recruited through online platforms, social support groups, and community centers. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather data on participants' experiences, perceptions, and attitudes towards their disability status. Thematic analysis will be employed to identify patterns and themes in the data.

Results:
Our findings indicate that disability status has a significant impact on the lives of NES people who are carriers of genetic conditions. The following themes emerged from the data:

1. Social isolation: Many participants reported feeling isolated and excluded from social events and activities due to their disability status. They felt that they were unable to participate fully in society, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Participants expressed experiencing stigma and discrimination based on their genetic condition. This led to feelings of shame, low self-esteem, and a lack of confidence.
3. Limited access to healthcare: NES people who are carriers of genetic conditions often face barriers in accessing appropriate healthcare services. They reported long wait times, poor communication with healthcare providers, and a lack of understanding about their condition.
4. Financial burden: Many participants struggled with the financial burden of managing their condition, including expensive medications, medical equipment, and home modifications. This led to stress and anxiety related to money management.
5. Emotional toll: Living with a genetic condition can take an emotional toll on NES people, leading to feelings of fear, anxiety, and sadness. They may also experience grief and loss due to the limitations imposed by their condition.
