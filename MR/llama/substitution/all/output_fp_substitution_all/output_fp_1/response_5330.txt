Addressing the specific needs of non-native Arabic speakers, particularly those who are recent widows or beginners, requires a tailored approach to education. Here are some suggestions on how to address their needs:

1. Cultural sensitivity: It is essential to be culturally sensitive when teaching Arabic to non-native speakers, especially women. This means being aware of the cultural norms and practices in the Arab world and adjusting teaching methods accordingly. For example, it may be necessary to adapt lesson plans to accommodate the needs of women who may have different learning styles or requirements due to their gender.
2. Introductory courses: Offer introductory courses specifically designed for beginners, including those who are recent widows. These courses should cover basic Arabic grammar and vocabulary, as well as cultural norms and customs. This will provide a solid foundation for further study.
