6. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and accessibility, such as anti-discrimination laws and accessible transportation options.
7. Healthcare support: Ensure that healthcare providers are trained to provide culturally sensitive and inclusive care to individuals with genetic conditions. This can help address any disparities in healthcare access and quality.
8. Financial support: Provide financial assistance to individuals with genetic conditions, such as grants or scholarships, to help them cover the costs of living with their condition.
