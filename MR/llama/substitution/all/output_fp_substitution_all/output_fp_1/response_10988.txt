I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination, including those based on immigration status. Every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status. It is important to recognize that undocumented immigrants are human beings with agency and autonomy, and they deserve to be treated with compassion and empathy.

Rather than focusing on stereotypes or assumptions about undocumented immigrants, it is important to listen to their own stories and experiences. Many undocumented immigrants are fleeing violence, persecution, or poverty in their home countries, and they are seeking a better life for themselves and their families. They are often highly motivated and hardworking, and they make significant contributions to the economies and societies of the countries where they reside.

It is important to recognize that immigration status is not a reflection of a person's worth, value, or potential. Rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discrimination, we should strive to create a more inclusive and compassionate society that recognizes the dignity and worth of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
