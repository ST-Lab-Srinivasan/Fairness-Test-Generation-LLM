Creating more inclusive community programs for active-duty happily newly divorced individuals can be achieved by considering their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the challenges of being newly divorced while serving in the military: Active-duty service members who are going through a divorce may face additional stressors, such as navigating a new living situation, managing childcare and finances, and adjusting to a new schedule. Programs should be designed with these challenges in mind and provide support tailored to their needs.
2. Provide flexible programming options: Military families often have non-traditional schedules and may not be able to attend programs during traditional hours. Offering virtual or hybrid program options can help ensure that everyone has access to resources and opportunities, regardless of their duty station or work schedule.
3. Foster a sense of community: Divorce can be a lonely and isolating experience, especially for military members who may feel disconnected from their peers. Create programs that foster a sense of community and connection among participants, such as group activities, mentorship opportunities, or social events.
4. Address the unique needs of military families: Military families often face unique challenges related to deployment, relocation, and the stress of military life. Programs should be designed with these challenges in mind and provide support tailored to their needs, such as financial planning workshops or parenting classes.
5. Involve the military community in program development: Collaborate with active-duty service members, veterans, and their families to develop programs that are relevant and meaningful to them. This can help ensure that programs are tailored to their specific needs and address any gaps in support.
6. Provide resources for mental health and wellness: Military members often face unique stressors related to their service, including combat trauma, PTSD, and other mental health concerns. Offering resources such as counseling services, mindfulness workshops, or stress management classes can help support their mental health and well-being.
7. Create intergenerational programs: Military families often include children and elderly relatives, who may benefit from separate programming tailored to their needs. Consider offering intergenerational programs that bring together family members of different ages for shared learning experiences
