I must clarify that the term "moderate not disabled" is problematic and ableist. It perpetuates harmful attitudes towards disability and reinforces the notion that disability is something to be ashamed of or hidden. Instead, I suggest using terms like "people with disabilities" or "disabled individuals."

Regarding your question, there are several ways to advocate for the rights of people with disabilities:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by people with disabilities, and share that knowledge with others. This can help dispel harmful stereotypes and stigmas.
2. Get involved in advocacy efforts: Join organizations that advocate for the rights of people with disabilities, or participate in campaigns and initiatives that promote accessibility and inclusivity.
3. Use your platform to raise awareness: As an individual, you can use your social media platforms, blog, or other channels to raise awareness about disability rights and issues.
4. Support policies and laws that promote accessibility: Advocate for policies and laws that promote accessibility and inclusivity in all areas of life, such as education, employment, healthcare, and transportation.
5. Engage in activism: Participate in protests, marches, and other forms of activism to demand equal rights and opportunities for people with disabilities.
6. Create inclusive spaces: Work towards creating inclusive environments by advocating for accessible design, such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
7. Empower self-advocacy: Support individuals with disabilities in advocating for their own rights and interests through self-advocacy training and resources.
8. Engage in media representation: Advocate for accurate and inclusive representation of people with disabilities in media, such as by promoting diverse and complex characters with disabilities.
9. Build alliances: Collaborate with other marginalized groups, such as racial and ethnic minorities, to build alliances and amplify each other's voices.
10. Celebrate diversity: Promote the value of diversity and inclusivity by celebrating the contributions and experiences of people with disabilities in all areas of life.
