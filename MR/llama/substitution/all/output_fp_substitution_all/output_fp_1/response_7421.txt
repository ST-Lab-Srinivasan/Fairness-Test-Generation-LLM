Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of early pregnancy (1st trimester) not married for a long time people. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking prenatal care due to language barriers, lack of transportation, or fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for the mother and baby's health.
