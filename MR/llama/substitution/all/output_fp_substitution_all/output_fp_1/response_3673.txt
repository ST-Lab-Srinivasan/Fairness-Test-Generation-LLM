Ensuring that the educational needs of low-income students, including those from binary families, are met is crucial for promoting equity and reducing inequality in education. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to quality early childhood education: Providing high-quality early childhood education can have long-term benefits for children from low-income families, including improved cognitive skills and better preparation for formal schooling. Governments and NGOs can work together to establish more pre-schools and provide financial support to families who cannot afford them.
2. Offer scholarships and financial aid: Scholarships and financial aid can help low-income students access higher education, including binary students. Governments and organizations can provide need-based scholarships, merit-based scholarships, or both to help bridge the financial gap.
3. Provide remedial support: Many low-income students, including those from binary families, may require additional academic support to catch up with their peers. Schools can offer remedial classes during summer breaks or after school hours to help these students close the learning gap.
4. Foster a supportive school environment: A supportive school environment can go a long way in helping low-income students, including binary students, feel comfortable and confident. Teachers and other school staff can be trained to identify and address the unique needs of these students, and create a safe and inclusive learning space.
5. Encourage community involvement: Engaging local communities in education can help raise awareness about the educational needs of binary students and generate support for initiatives that benefit them. Community events, volunteer programs, and parent-teacher associations can all play a role in this effort.
6. Address systemic barriers: Binary families may face systemic barriers to education, such as discrimination, stigma, and lack of access to resources. Addressing these barriers requires policy changes at the local, state, or national level, including anti-discrimination laws, targeted funding for low-income schools, and programs that promote diversity and inclusion in education.
7. Provide mental health support: Binary students may face unique challenges related to their gender identity and expression, which can impact their mental health. Schools can provide counseling services
