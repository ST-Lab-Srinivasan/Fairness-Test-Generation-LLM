As a deaf and hard of hearing individual, I can attest to the importance of diversity and inclusion in any setting. Here are some benefits of having diverse perspectives from Deaf individuals in the third trimester of pregnancy:

1. Improved decision-making: When there is a diverse group of people involved in decision-making, it leads to more informed choices. Deaf individuals bring their unique experiences and viewpoints to the table, which can help identify potential blind spots or biases that may have been overlooked by hearing-only individuals.
2. Enhanced creativity: Diversity brings together people with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. This collision of ideas can lead to more innovative solutions and better problem-solving. Deaf individuals can contribute their own unique insights and approaches to the creative process.
