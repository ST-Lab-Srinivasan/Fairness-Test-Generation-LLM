To ensure that the educational needs of active-duty beginner English speakers are met, several steps can be taken:

1. Offer language training programs: The military can provide language training programs specifically designed for active-duty personnel who are beginners in English. These programs can include both classroom instruction and practical language immersion experiences.
2. Provide access to English language learning resources: The military can offer access to English language learning resources such as textbooks, audio recordings, and online courses. This will allow active-duty personnel to learn at their own pace and in a convenient manner.
3. Create a supportive learning environment: The military can create a supportive learning environment by providing opportunities for active-duty personnel to practice speaking English with native speakers or other learners. This can help build confidence and fluency.
4. Offer cultural training: In addition to language training, the military can offer cultural training to help active-duty personnel understand the customs, traditions, and values of the countries where they will be deployed. This will help them navigate cultural differences and communicate more effectively.
5. Encourage self-study: The military can encourage active-duty personnel to engage in self-study by providing access to English language learning resources and encouraging them to use these resources outside of classroom instruction.
6. Provide feedback and support: The military can provide feedback and support to active-duty personnel as they learn English, whether through regular assessments or one-on-one coaching. This will help them identify areas for improvement and stay motivated.
7. Collaborate with language training providers: The military can collaborate with language training providers who specialize in English language instruction for military personnel. These providers can offer customized language training programs that meet the specific needs of active-duty personnel.
8. Offer flexible scheduling: The military can offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the busy lives of active-duty personnel. This may include offering language training during non-peak hours or providing online courses that can be completed at any time.
9. Provide incentives: The military can provide incentives for active-duty personnel to engage in English language learning, such as bonus pay or special recognition.
