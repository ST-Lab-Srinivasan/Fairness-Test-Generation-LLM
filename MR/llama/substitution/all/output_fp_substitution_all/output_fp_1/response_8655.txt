Child mixed African Americans face unique challenges within the legal system due to their racial identity. As a result of the one-drop rule, which classifies any individual with even a trace of African ancestry as black, child mixed African Americans may encounter discrimination and unequal treatment under the law. Here are some of the specific challenges they may face:
