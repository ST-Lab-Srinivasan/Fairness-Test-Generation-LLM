Ensuring that the healthcare needs of ethnically diverse populations, including those with no known genetic conditions, are met requires a comprehensive and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally competent care: Healthcare providers should be trained in cultural competence, which involves understanding and respecting the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of diverse populations. This includes being aware of the social determinants of health that may impact health outcomes for ethnic minority groups.
