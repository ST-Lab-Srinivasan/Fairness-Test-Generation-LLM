Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of not recently married beginner Spanish speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or society. For individuals who are not recently married and just starting to learn Spanish, their cultural heritage can influence their language learning journey in several ways:
