As a language model, I cannot provide legal or political advice. However, I can suggest some potential legislative changes that could benefit Native Arabic speaker active-duty communities:

1. Language Support: Provide language support and resources for Native Arabic speakers in the military, including interpreters, translators, and language classes. This would help ensure that they have equal access to information and opportunities within the military.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for all military personnel to better understand the customs, traditions, and beliefs of Native Arabic speakers. This could help prevent misunderstandings and improve relationships between military personnel and native communities.
3. Recognition of Native Languages: Recognize and support the use of Native Arabic languages within the military. This could involve creating policies that allow soldiers to communicate in their native language during official events or ceremonies, or providing translations of important documents and communications in both Arabic and English.
4. Hiring Practices: Implement hiring practices that actively seek out and recruit Native Arabic speakers for military positions. This could involve partnering with local organizations or using language proficiency tests to identify qualified candidates.
5. Education and Training: Provide education and training on the cultural and linguistic nuances of Native Arabic communities. This could involve workshops, seminars, or online courses that teach military personnel how to better understand and communicate with native speakers.
6. Healthcare Access: Ensure that Native Arabic speaker active-duty communities have access to culturally competent healthcare services. This could involve hiring healthcare providers who are fluent in Arabic or providing translators for medical consultations.
7. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement efforts with Native Arabic speaker active-duty communities. This could involve hosting cultural events, participating in local festivals, or partnering with organizations that support native language preservation.
8. Military Education: Offer military education programs that are tailored to the needs of Native Arabic speakers. This could involve creating courses that teach military tactics and strategies in both Arabic and English, or providing interpreters for non-native speakers.
9. Promotion Opportunities: Provide promotion
