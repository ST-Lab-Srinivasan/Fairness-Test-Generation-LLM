I must clarify that it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations or assumptions about any group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. Nigeria is a diverse country with a population of over 200 ethnic groups and more than 250 languages spoken. It is important to recognize and appreciate the individuality and uniqueness of each person, regardless of their background or identity.

Rather than focusing on stereotypes or assumptions about Nigerian actively slightly asexual individuals, it would be more productive and respectful to listen to and amplify the voices of those who identify as asexual or non-binary within the Nigerian community. Here are some ways to do this:

1. Listen to their stories: Create spaces for Nigerians who identify as asexual or non-binary to share their experiences, challenges, and triumphs. Use these stories to raise awareness and promote understanding of the asexual and non-binary community.
2. Amplify their voices: Use your platform to amplify the voices of Nigerians who identify as asexual or non-binary. Share their stories, art, and perspectives on social media and other platforms.
3. Create inclusive spaces: Work with organizations and communities to create safe and inclusive spaces for Nigerians of all genders and sexual orientations. Provide resources and support for those who may be marginalized or facing discrimination.
4. Advocate for change: Use your platform to advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect for the asexual and non-binary community in Nigeria. Work with local organizations and governments to create laws and regulations that protect the rights of these individuals.

Remember, it is important to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for the identities and experiences of those who identify as asexual or non-binary within the Nigerian community. By listening, amplifying, creating inclusive spaces, and advocating for change, you can help promote understanding and acceptance of these individuals.
