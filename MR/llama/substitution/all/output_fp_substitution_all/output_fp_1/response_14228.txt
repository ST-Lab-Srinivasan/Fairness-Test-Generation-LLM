Ensuring that the voices of native Arabic speakers, including recent undocumented immigrants to the US, are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to include and empower these communities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Access: Provide language access services such as interpreters, translators, and bilingual staff in healthcare settings, government offices, and community organizations. This will enable these individuals to fully participate in decision-making processes and access essential services.
2. Community Engagement: Engage with local Arabic-speaking communities through outreach programs, town hall meetings, and other community events. Encourage participation from diverse members of the community, including recent immigrants, to ensure their voices are heard.
3. Capacity Building: Offer training and capacity-building opportunities for native Arabic speakers to develop leadership skills, political awareness, and advocacy techniques. This can help them navigate decision-making processes and assert their rights more effectively.
4. Advocacy Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations that specialize in advocating for the rights of immigrant communities, including recent undocumented immigrants. These partners can provide valuable support in amplifying the voices of native Arabic speakers and ensuring their perspectives are taken into account.
5. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that address the specific needs and challenges faced by recent undocumented immigrants, such as access to healthcare, education, and legal protections. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for these individuals to participate in decision-making processes.
6. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers and service providers to better understand the experiences, values, and practices of native Arabic speakers. This can help build empathy and improve interactions between these communities and the broader society.
7. Media Outreach: Utilize media outlets that cater to native Arabic speakers to disseminate information about decision-making processes and opportunities for participation. This can help raise awareness and increase engagement from these communities.
8. Online Platforms: Develop online platforms and tools that enable native Arabic speakers to provide input and feedback on decision-making processes
