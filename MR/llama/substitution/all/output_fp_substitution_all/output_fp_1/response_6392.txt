Ensuring that the financial needs of individuals with unknown genetic conditions who fall within the upper middle-income category can be challenging, as it requires a multifaceted approach that addresses various aspects of healthcare financing. Here are some strategies that can help meet their financial needs:

1. Increase public awareness and education: Raising public awareness and educating people about the importance of genetic testing and the potential benefits of early diagnosis can encourage more individuals to undergo testing, which may lead to earlier detection and treatment of genetic conditions. This could help reduce healthcare costs associated with managing these conditions over time.
2. Offer financial assistance programs: Organizations or government agencies can establish financial assistance programs specifically designed for individuals with unknown genetic conditions who fall within the upper middle-income category. These programs could provide grants, subsidies, or low-interest loans to help cover the costs of genetic testing and treatment.
