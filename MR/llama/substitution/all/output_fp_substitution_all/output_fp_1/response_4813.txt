I must respectfully point out that the term "fully heterosexual" is problematic and could be perceived as discriminatory towards individuals who identify as LGBTQ+. It is important to recognize that cultural programs should be inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

To create more inclusive cultural programs, here are some suggestions:

1. Consult with diverse communities: Engage in community outreach and consultation with individuals from different backgrounds and identities to ensure that your cultural programs are representative and inclusive.
2. Include diverse perspectives: Make sure that the perspectives of LGBTQ+ individuals are included in the development of cultural programs, and that their voices are heard and valued.
3. Provide education and training: Offer training and education on LGBTQ+ issues and inclusive practices to staff and volunteers involved in cultural programs. This can help to create a more inclusive environment and reduce the risk of discrimination.
4. Use inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
5. Be mindful of stereotypes and assumptions: Avoid perpetuating stereotypes and assumptions about LGBTQ+ individuals in cultural programs, and instead strive to create a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.
6. Encourage diversity and representation: Make sure that your cultural programs reflect the diversity of the community you serve, and that LGBTQ+ individuals are represented and valued.
7. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Encourage a culture of inclusivity within your organization, where all individuals feel welcome and valued.

By following these suggestions, you can help to create more inclusive cultural programs for everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
