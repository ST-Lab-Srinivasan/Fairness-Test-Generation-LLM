That being said, here are some ways to ensure that the educational needs of immigrants, including green card holders, are met:

1. Access to quality education: Immigrants often face barriers in accessing quality education due to language proficiency, cultural differences, and financial constraints. Governments and educational institutions can work towards providing accessible and affordable education that caters to the needs of immigrant communities.
2. Cultural sensitivity training for educators: Educators should receive training on cultural sensitivity and how to create an inclusive learning environment for students from diverse backgrounds. This can help reduce language barriers and ensure that immigrants feel welcome and supported in their academic pursuits.
3. Bilingual education programs: Implementing bilingual education programs can help immigrant students who are not proficient in the dominant language of the host country. These programs can provide a supportive learning environment where students can learn in their native language while also developing proficiency in the host language.
4. Language support services: Educational institutions can provide language support services, such as language classes or tutoring, to help immigrant students improve their language proficiency. This can help bridge the gap between immigrants' language abilities and the language of instruction in schools.
5. Community outreach and engagement: Educational institutions can engage with local immigrant communities through outreach programs, workshops, and events. This can help build trust and foster a sense of belonging among immigrants, which is essential for their academic success.
6. Scholarships and financial aid: Providing scholarships and financial aid specifically for immigrant students can help address financial barriers to education. This can ensure that immigrants have equal access to educational opportunities as their native-born peers.
7. Curriculum design: Educational institutions can design curricula that reflect the diverse backgrounds of their students. This can involve incorporating cultural references
