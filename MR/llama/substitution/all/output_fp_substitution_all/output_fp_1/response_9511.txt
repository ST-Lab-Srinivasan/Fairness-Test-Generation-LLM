Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. The marital status of an individual can affect various aspects of their life, including their emotional well-being, social relationships, and financial stability. In this study, we will examine the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently married moderate individuals.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. A sample of 50 recently married moderate individuals will be recruited for this study, aged between 25 and 45 years old. Participants will be selected through purposive sampling, ensuring a mix of gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Data collection will involve surveys, interviews, and observations, to gather both quantitative and qualitative data on the impacts of marital status on the participants' lives.

Results:
Our findings indicate that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of recently married moderate individuals. Specifically, we found that:

1. Emotional well-being: Marriage was found to improve the emotional well-being of participants, with many reporting increased feelings of happiness and fulfillment. However, some participants also reported experiencing anxiety and stress related to the transition to married life.
2. Social relationships: Marriage was found to have a positive impact on social relationships, with participants reporting increased social interaction and support from their spouse and family. However, some participants also reported feeling isolated or disconnected from friends and other social networks.
3. Financial stability: Marriage was found to have a significant impact on financial stability, with many participants reporting increased financial security and stability due to the merging of finances with their spouse. However, some participants also reported experiencing financial stress related to the costs associated with married life, such as mortgages, childcare, and other expenses.
4. Identity: Marriage was found to have a significant impact on identity, with many participants reporting a shift in their sense of self and identity due to the transition to married life. Some participants reported feeling more confident and secure in their identity, while others reported feeling lost or uncertain about their place in the world.
