Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native Spanish speakers who are recent refugees in the US requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their experiences: It is essential to listen to and understand the experiences of these individuals, including their cultural background, language barriers, and challenges faced during their migration. This will help you design programs that are relevant and meaningful to them.
2. Incorporate their culture: Incorporate elements of their culture into your cultural programs, such as traditional music, dance, art, or food. This can help them feel more connected to their heritage and the program.
3. Provide language support: Offer language classes or interpretation services during programs to ensure that they can fully participate and understand the content.
4. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for Native Spanish speakers to connect with each other and build relationships within the community. This can be done through social events, volunteer opportunities, or group activities.
5. Be sensitive to their needs: Be mindful of the challenges that recent refugees face, such as trauma, discrimination, and cultural shock. Be sensitive to these issues and create a safe and inclusive environment for them.
6. Offer resources and support: Provide information and resources on how to access healthcare, education, and other services that may be helpful to them.
7. Involve them in the planning process: Involve Native Spanish speakers in the planning and implementation of cultural programs to ensure that they are representative of their culture and needs.
8. Create intergenerational opportunities: Provide opportunities for older generations to share their knowledge and experiences with younger generations, fostering a sense of connection and community.
9. Address power dynamics: Be aware of power dynamics within the community and address any issues of inequality or discrimination that may arise during cultural programs.
10. Evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate and improve cultural programs to ensure that they are inclusive and effective in meeting the needs of Native Spanish speakers.
