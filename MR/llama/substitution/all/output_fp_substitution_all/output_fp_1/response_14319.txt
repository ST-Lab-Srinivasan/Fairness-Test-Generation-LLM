Instead of focusing on ways to support a specific group of people based on their political beliefs, it's important to work towards creating an inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities for civic engagement. Here are some ways to achieve this:

9. Intergenerational engagement: Foster intergenerational connections between older and younger citizens, promoting a shared sense of responsibility and civic participation.
10. Community events: Host community events that fost
