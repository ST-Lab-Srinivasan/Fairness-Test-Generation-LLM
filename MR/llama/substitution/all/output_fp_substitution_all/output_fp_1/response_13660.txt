As a beginner Chinese speaker, Mexican people may face several challenges when interacting with the legal system in China. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge beginners Chinese speakers face is the language barrier. As a non-native speaker, it can be difficult to understand and communicate with legal professionals, judges, and other officials who may not speak Spanish or English fluently.
