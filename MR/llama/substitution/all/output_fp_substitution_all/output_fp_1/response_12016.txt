Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are ethnically Hispanic requires understanding and valuing their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Engage with local Hispanic communities by hosting events, workshops, or classes that cater to their interests and needs. This can help build trust and create a sense of belonging.

8. Active listening: Listen actively to the needs and concerns of beginner Spanish speakers and incorporate their feedback into program design. This can help ensure that programs are tailored to their specific interests and needs.
9. Cultural mentorship: Pair beginner Spanish speakers with experienced cultural mentors who can provide guidance and support in navigating cultural events and activities.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of Hispanic cultures and avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing dominant cultural narratives. Instead
