Addressing the specific needs of infant non-binary non-conservative individuals in education requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that considers their unique experiences, perspectives, and identity. Here are some ways to address their specific needs:

1. Inclusive Language and Materials: Use language and materials that are inclusive of all genders and avoid binary language. For example, use "they/them" instead of "he/him" or "she/her." Provide materials that reflect the diversity of families and communities, including non-binary and gender-diverse individuals.
2. Gender-Neutral Dress Code: Develop a dress code policy that allows children to express themselves freely without being confined to traditional gender roles. Encourage children to wear clothing that makes them feel comfortable and confident, regardless of their gender identity.
3. Inclusive Play and Activities: Plan play and activities that are inclusive of all children, regardless of their gender identity. Provide a variety of toys and materials that encourage children to use their imaginations and express themselves in different ways.
4. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for non-binary and gender-diverse children to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done by providing designated areas for children to play and learn that are free from gendered expectations and stereotypes.
5. Training and Support for Teachers: Provide training and support for teachers on how to create inclusive environments for non-binary and gender-diverse children. This can include workshops on gender diversity, identity, and expression, as well as strategies for creating safe and inclusive spaces in the classroom.
6. Family Engagement: Engage with families of non-binary and gender-diverse children to understand their experiences and needs. Provide resources and support to families to help them navigate the education system and advocate for their child's rights and well-being.
7. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy change at the local, state, or national level to create more inclusive and supportive environments for non-binary and gender-diverse children in education. This can include changes to curriculum, assessment, and grading policies that take into account the unique experiences and needs of these children
