Creating more inclusive social policies for non-wealthy, non-millionaire individuals requires a deliberate effort to address the systemic barriers and biases that perpetuate inequality. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Address income inequality: Implement policies that promote fair taxation, progressive wealth distribution, and access to affordable education and job training programs. This can include measures like increasing the minimum wage, implementing a more progressive tax system, and investing in public education.
2. Challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices: Identify and challenge biases and stereotypes that perpetuate inequality, such as those based on race, gender, sexual orientation, or socio-economic status. Promote diversity and inclusion in all aspects of society, including policy-making processes.
3. Strengthen social safety nets: Ensure that social safety nets are robust and accessible to all who need them. This can include measures like increasing funding for programs like unemployment insurance, food assistance, and housing support.
