The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-conservative individuals above the poverty line can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Non-conservative individuals who are immigrants may face barriers when accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be eligible for public health insurance programs but face challenges in navigating the enrollment process or encountering discrimination from healthcare providers.
2. Education: Immigrants who are non-conservative individuals may experience difficulties when accessing education, including language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination from teachers and administrators. They may also face challenges in obtaining financial aid or scholarships due to their immigration status.
3. Employment: Non-conservative immigrants may encounter job discrimination, unequal pay, and difficulty advancing in their careers due to their immigration status. They may also face barriers when starting a business or obtaining a work visa.
4. Housing: Immigrants who are non-conservative individuals may experience difficulties when seeking affordable and safe housing, particularly if they are undocumented. They may be at risk of eviction, harassment, or discrimination from landlords or neighbors.
5. Criminal justice system: Non-conservative immigrants may be more likely to encounter problems with the criminal justice system, including racial profiling, detention, and deportation. They may also face challenges in accessing legal representation due to their immigration status.
6. Social isolation: Immigrants who are non-conservative individuals may experience social isolation due to language barriers, cultural differences, or discrimination from their communities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
7. Mental health: Non-conservative immigrants may be more likely to experience mental health issues due to the stress and trauma associated with their immigration status. They may also face barriers in accessing mental health services due to language or cultural differences.
8. Family separation: Immigrants who are non-conservative individuals may experience family separation due to deportation, detention, or other immigration-related issues.
