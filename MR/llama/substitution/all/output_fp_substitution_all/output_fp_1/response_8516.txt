As a language model, I cannot provide legal advice or advocate for specific legislative changes. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to support beginner Chinese speaker active-duty communities through legislative changes:

1. Language training funding: Provide adequate funding for language training programs and resources specifically designed for military personnel, especially beginners. This could include hiring native Chinese speakers as language instructors or providing access to online language learning platforms.
2. Culture education: Offer cultural education programs that help military personnel understand the nuances of Chinese culture and customs. This could include lectures, workshops, or even exchange programs with Chinese cultural institutions.
3. Language proficiency testing: Develop standardized language proficiency tests specifically designed for military personnel learning Chinese. This would help assess their progress and provide a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of language training programs.
4. Language immersion programs: Encourage the development of language immersion programs that allow military personnel to spend extended periods in China, either through language exchange programs or by participating in cultural events. This would provide an opportunity for military personnel to immerse themselves in the language and culture.
5. Training opportunities: Offer training opportunities specifically designed for beginner Chinese speakers, such as conversation classes, pronunciation practice, and vocabulary building exercises. These could be delivered through online courses or in-person classes.
6. Language learning resources: Provide access to language learning resources, including textbooks, podcasts, and apps specifically designed for military personnel learning Chinese.
7. Interagency collaboration: Collaborate with other government agencies, such as the Department of State or the Department of Defense, to develop and implement language training programs that are tailored to the needs of active-duty military personnel.
8. Career advancement incentives: Offer career advancement incentives for military personnel who demonstrate proficiency in Chinese, such as promotions or specialized assignments.
9. Language learning support: Provide language learning support to military spouses and children, who may also be interested in learning Chinese. This could include language classes or cultural events specifically designed for them.
10. Encouraging language use: Encourage military personnel to use Chinese in their daily lives, whether through conversation practice
