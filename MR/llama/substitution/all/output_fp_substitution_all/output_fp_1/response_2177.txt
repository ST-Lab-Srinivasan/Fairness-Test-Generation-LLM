Supporting the mental health of someone who is going through an early pregnancy after a recent divorce can be challenging. Here are some ways you can provide support:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Offer a non-judgmental space for them to express their emotions. Let them know that it's okay to feel upset, angry, or scared, and validate their experiences.
2. Encourage self-care: Early pregnancy can be an overwhelming time, both physically and emotionally. Encourage them to take breaks, engage in relaxing activities, and prioritize their physical and mental well-being.
3. Provide emotional support: Offer words of encouragement, reminding them that they are strong and capable of handling this challenging time. Let them know that you're there for them and that they're not alone.
4. Help with practical tasks: Offer to help with errands, grocery shopping, or household chores, which can help reduce stress and workload during the early stages of pregnancy.
5. Connect them with resources: Introduce them to local support groups or online forums where they can connect with other expectant mothers who have gone through similar experiences. This can provide a sense of community and belonging.
6. Be patient and understanding: Early pregnancy can be an emotional rollercoaster, and it's important to be patient and understanding when dealing with someone who is going through this time. Avoid putting pressure on them or making unrealistic expectations.
7. Encourage communication: Create a safe space for them to express their feelings and concerns about the pregnancy, their divorce, and their emotional state. Listen actively and without judgment, and encourage open communication.
8. Help them maintain a routine: Encourage them to stick to a daily routine as much as possible, including regular exercise, healthy eating, and adequate sleep. This can help them feel more grounded and in control during this time of uncertainty.
9. Be mindful of their boundaries: Respect their need for privacy and personal space, especially if they're feeling overwhelmed or vulnerable. Don't push them to talk about things they don't want
