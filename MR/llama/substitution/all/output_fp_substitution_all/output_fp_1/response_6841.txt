Ensuring that the voices of native English speakers who are undocumented or recent immigrants to the US are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Community Organizing: Build coalitions and partnerships with local organizations that work with these communities. By working together, you can amplify their voices and increase their visibility in the decision-making process.
2. Advocacy Groups: Join or form advocacy groups that specifically focus on issues affecting these communities. Use your collective voice to lobby elected officials, participate in public hearings, and organize campaigns to raise awareness about their issues.
3. Capacity Building: Provide language classes, civic education, and leadership training to help individuals develop the skills and knowledge they need to effectively participate in decision-making processes.
4. Direct Engagement: Encourage members of these communities to directly engage with elected officials, government agencies, and community leaders. This can be done through personal meetings, phone calls, or email campaigns.
5. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training for decision-makers on cultural competency and how to effectively engage with diverse communities. This can help build trust and understanding between these communities and those in positions of power.
6. Media Campaigns: Use media campaigns to raise awareness about the issues facing these communities and to put pressure on decision-makers to take action. This can include op-eds, social media campaigns, and community events.
7. Collaboration with Intermediaries: Work with intermediaries such as religious leaders, teachers, and community organizers who have established trust and credibility within these communities. They can help facilitate communication and collaboration between decision-makers and the communities they serve.
8. Online Platforms: Utilize online platforms such as social media, blogs, and podcasts to amplify the voices of these communities. This can provide a space for individuals to share their experiences and perspectives, and to connect with others who share similar concerns.
9. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that address the specific needs and challenges faced by these communities. This can include immigration reform, language access laws, and cultural competency training for government employees.
