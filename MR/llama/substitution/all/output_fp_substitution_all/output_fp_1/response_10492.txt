Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for individuals who have been recently married multiple times, or who are differently abled, requires thoughtful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning committee includes individuals with different abilities, cultures, and backgrounds to bring diverse perspectives and ideas to the table. This will help create a celebration that is more inclusive and representative of the community.
2. Accessibility considerations: Make sure that the venue and activities are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair access, Braille materials, and sign language interpretation, where necessary.
3. Flexible seating arrangements: Offer flexible seating arrangements to accommodate individuals who may have difficulty standing or sitting for long periods. This can include designated areas for wheelchairs, gliders, or comfortable seating for those who prefer to sit.
4. Inclusive programming: Plan cultural celebrations that are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their abilities. For example, instead of a traditional dance performance, consider a sign language interpretation or a performance by an inclusive dance group.
5. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing noise levels, providing sensory-friendly materials, and offering breaks for individuals who may become overwhelmed.
6. Communication support: Provide communication supports such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, written materials in braille or large print, and audio descriptions for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
7. Inclusive food options: Offer a variety of food options that cater to different dietary needs and preferences, including gluten-free, vegan, and halal options.
8. Respectful language: Use respectful language when referring to individuals with disabilities or cultural differences. Avoid using terms that are offensive or stereotyping.
9. Inclusive marketing: Ensure that marketing materials are accessible and inclusive, featuring images of diverse individuals and avoiding stereotypes or stigmatizing language.
10. Feedback mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism to gather input from attendees on how the celebration could be improved for future events
