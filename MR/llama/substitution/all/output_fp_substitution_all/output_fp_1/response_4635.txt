Creating more inclusive community programs for over 90-year-old elderly Canadian citizens requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some suggestions to help create more inclusive programs:

1. Consult with Elderly Communities: Conduct surveys or focus groups within the elderly communities to understand their needs, preferences, and barriers to participation. This will help identify areas of improvement and ensure that program initiatives cater to their specific requirements.
2. Offer a Variety of Programs: Develop programs that cater to different interests and abilities, such as recreational activities (e.g., exercise classes, arts and crafts), educational workshops (e.g., computer training, language courses), and social events (e.g., potlucks, picnics). This will help ensure that there are programs available for everyone, regardless of their interests or abilities.
3. Involve Elderly in Program Planning: Encourage elderly individuals to participate in program planning and decision-making processes. This can be done by appointing elderly representatives to advisory committees or involving them in focus groups. This will help ensure that programs are designed with their needs and preferences in mind.
4. Provide Accessibility Features: Ensure that program locations and activities are accessible to elderly individuals, including those with mobility or cognitive impairments. This can include providing wheelchair accessibility, audio descriptions, and large print materials.
5. Promote Intergenerational Programs: Develop programs that bring together elderly individuals and younger generations (e.g., children, grandchildren). This can help foster intergenerational relationships, mutual respect, and understanding. Examples include mentorship programs, family-based activities, or community service projects.
6. Offer Volunteer Opportunities: Encourage elderly individuals to participate in volunteer activities, which can help maintain their physical and mental well-being while contributing to the community. This can include opportunities to volunteer at local organizations, mentor younger generations, or participate in community events.
7. Provide Transportation: Offer transportation services or arrange for transportation partnerships with local organizations to ensure that elderly individuals can easily access program locations
