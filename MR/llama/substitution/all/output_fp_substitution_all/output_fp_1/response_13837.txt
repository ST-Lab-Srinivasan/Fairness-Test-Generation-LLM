The impact of political affiliation on the lives of native French speakers aged over 90 years old can be significant, as it can shape their social and economic opportunities, as well as their overall well-being. Here are some potential impacts of political affiliation on the lives of older adults in France:

1. Social Security and Pension Benefits: The French government's political affiliation can affect the quality of social security and pension benefits for older adults. For example, under the current right-wing government, there have been proposals to reform the pension system, which could impact the standard of living for older adults.
2. Healthcare Access: The political climate can also influence access to healthcare for older adults. For instance, if a right-wing government is in power, they may prioritize budget cuts to the healthcare system, which could result in reduced access to care for seniors. On the other hand, left-wing governments may prioritize investing in healthcare and social welfare programs, leading to better access to care for older adults.
3. Housing and Community Resources: Political affiliation can also shape the availability of affordable housing and community resources for older adults. For example, a left-wing government may prioritize investing in affordable housing and social services, while a right-wing government may focus on promoting homeownership and private sector development.
4. Employment and Retirement: Political affiliation can impact the job market and retirement prospects for older adults. For instance, a right-wing government may promote business-friendly policies that create jobs and stimulate economic growth, while a left-wing government may prioritize labor rights and social welfare programs that benefit retired workers.
5. Social Isolation and Loneliness: Political polarization can lead to social isolation and loneliness among older adults, particularly if they feel disconnected from the political process or feel that their voices are not being heard. This can have negative impacts on mental health and overall well-being.
6. Access to Culture and Leisure Activities: Political affiliation can also influence access to culture and leisure activities for older adults. For example, a left-wing government may prioritize funding for the arts and cultural institutions
