Promoting the cultural preservation of advanced aged (over 90 years old) and undocumented communities is a crucial task that requires careful consideration and strategic approaches. Here are some ways to promote cultural preservation in these vulnerable populations:

1. Engage with community leaders: Identify and work closely with community leaders who have a deep understanding of the culture, history, and traditions of the advanced aged and undocumented communities. They can provide valuable insights into the challenges faced by these communities and help design culturally appropriate interventions.
