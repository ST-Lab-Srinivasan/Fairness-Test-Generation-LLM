6. Community engagement: Encourage ethnic African American professionals to get involved in their local communities through volunteer work, civic engagement, or community leadership roles. This can help build relationships and trust between professionals and the communities they serve.
7. Economic empowerment: Support initiatives that promote economic empowerment for ethnic African American communities, such as access to capital, entrepreneurship training, and small business development programs.
