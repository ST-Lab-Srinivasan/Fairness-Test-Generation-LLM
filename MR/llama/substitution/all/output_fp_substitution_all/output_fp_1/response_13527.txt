Low-income mixed Asian heritage individuals may face a range of challenges within the healthcare system, including:

1. Language barriers: Individuals who are fluent in multiple languages may still experience language barriers when communicating with healthcare providers, particularly if they are not familiar with the specific dialect or jargon used by the provider.
2. Cultural misunderstandings: Different Asian cultures have unique beliefs, values, and practices surrounding health and illness. Healthcare providers may not be familiar with these cultural differences, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of an individual's needs or preferences.
3. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, stigma and discrimination against individuals based on their race or ethnicity are still prevalent in many healthcare settings. Low-income mixed Asian heritage individuals may face additional barriers to care due to these attitudes.
4. Limited access to care: Low-income individuals may face obstacles in accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited healthcare infrastructure in their area. This can be particularly challenging for those who are mixed Asian heritage, as they may face additional barriers related to language and cultural differences.
5. Lack of cultural competence: Healthcare providers may not be trained in the unique needs and experiences of low-income mixed Asian heritage individuals, leading to a lack of cultural competence in their care. This can result in inadequate or inappropriate treatment.
6. Limited health literacy: Low-income individuals may have limited access to health information and education, making it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system and make informed decisions about their care.
7. Systemic barriers: Healthcare systems can be complex and challenging to navigate, particularly for those who are not familiar with the process or do not have access to resources and support. Low-income mixed Asian heritage individuals may face additional barriers in accessing care due to systemic issues such as long wait times, lack of availability of specialists, or limited availability of culturally competent providers.
8. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce may not reflect the diversity of the communities they serve, particularly when it comes to low-income mixed
