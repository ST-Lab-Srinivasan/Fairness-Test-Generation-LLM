The role of mentorship in the development of ethnically full Hispanic adults over the age of 90 is crucial. Mentorship can provide a sense of belonging, validation, and support, which are essential for overall well-being, particularly during aging. Here are some ways mentorship can impact the development of ethnically full Hispanic adults in this age group:

1. Preservation of cultural identity: Mentorship can help preserve the mentee's cultural identity by sharing experiences, traditions, and values that are unique to their ethnic background. This can help the mentee feel connected to their heritage and culture, which is essential for overall well-being in older age.
2. Overcoming cultural barriers: Mentorship can help bridge cultural gaps by providing a safe space for mentees to share their experiences and challenges. The mentor can offer guidance and support, helping the mentee navigate cultural barriers and feel more confident in their identity.
3. Building social connections: Mentorship can help older Hispanic adults build social connections with others who share similar cultural backgrounds. This can help reduce feelings of isolation and loneliness, which are common among older adults.
4. Encouraging resilience: Mentorship can foster resilience in older Hispanic adults by providing a positive role model. The mentor can share their own experiences of overcoming challenges, offering hope and inspiration to the mentee.
5. Fostering cognitive function: Social interaction with others, including mentorship, can help foster cognitive function in older adults. This is especially important for Hispanic adults, who are at a higher risk of cognitive decline due to cultural and socioeconomic factors.
6. Providing emotional support: Mentorship can offer emotional support, which is essential for overall well-being in older age. The mentor can provide a listening ear, empathy, and validation, helping the mentee feel less lonely and more connected to their community.
7. Facilitating intergenerational connections: Mentorship can help bridge the generational gap between Hispanic adults over 90 years old and younger
