Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for binary autistic individuals requires understanding and accommodating the unique needs and experiences of this community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consult with autistic individuals: Involve binary autistic individuals in the planning process to ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account. This can help create a more authentic and inclusive experience for them.
