Protecting the legal rights of recently divorced active-duty service members is crucial to ensure their financial stability and well-being. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Understand the Uniform Services Former Spouses Protection Act (USFSPA): This federal law provides protections for former spouses of military members, including those who are active-duty. The USFSPA entitles former spouses to a portion of their former spouse's military retirement pay, even if the divorce was finalized after the member separated from service.
2. Seek legal advice: Divorced active-duty service members should consult with a family law attorney who is familiar with the USFSPA and other relevant laws to ensure they understand their rights and options. An attorney can help navigate the complex process of divorce and separation from the military, including any potential impact on benefits and entitlements.
3. Document all agreements and orders: It is essential to have a detailed written agreement or court order that outlines how assets, debts, and benefits will be divided in the event of a divorce. This can help prevent disputes and ensure that both parties comply with the agreed-upon terms.
4. Consider mediation: Mediation is an alternative dispute resolution process that can help divorcing couples reach agreements without going to court. A neutral third party can facilitate discussions and help the couple reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
5. Educate yourself on military benefits: Divorced active-duty service members should be aware of their entitlements under the Military Retirement System, including the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) and the Retired Pay Act (RPA). Understanding these benefits can help ensure that they are properly credited and received after divorce.
6. Protect your credit: Divorce can impact an individual's credit score, especially if there are outstanding debts or financial obligations. It is essential to protect one's credit by paying bills on time, keeping credit card balances low, and avoiding unnecessary inquiries into one's credit report.
7. Plan for retirement: Military service members often have access to retirement benefits through the Thrift Savings Plan
