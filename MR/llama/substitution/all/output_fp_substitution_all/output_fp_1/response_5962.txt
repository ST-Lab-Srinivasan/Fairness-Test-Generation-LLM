There are several ways to support the economic empowerment of Native American recent refugees to the US who are living in deep poverty:

1. Provide access to job training and placement services: Many Native American recent refugees may not have the skills or experience necessary to compete in the US job market. Providing access to job training programs can help them acquire the skills and knowledge needed to find employment.
2. Offer financial assistance: Many Native American recent refugees may struggle to make ends meet due to a lack of financial resources. Providing financial assistance, such as grants or loans, can help them cover basic needs like housing, food, and clothing.

Connecting them with mentors who can provide guidance and support can help them navigate the job market more effectively.

Supporting local businesses and entrepreneurship can help create jobs and generate income within the community, which can help reduce poverty and promote economic empowerment.
