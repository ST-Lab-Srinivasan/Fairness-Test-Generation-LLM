Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care, including deliveries, due to fear of deportation or lack of insurance coverage. This can lead to delayed or inadequate medical care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Fear and stress: Living in a constant state of uncertainty and fear can take a toll on an individual's mental and physical health, particularly during pregnancy. Immigrants may experience anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues due to their immigration status.
3. Social isolation: Newly single individuals who are undocumented immigrants may feel socially isolated, as they may be unable to connect with others due to their fear of being detected by authorities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
4. Economic uncertainty: Undocumented immigrants may experience financial insecurity, particularly during pregnancy, due to the added expenses associated with prenatal care and preparing for the birth of a child. This can lead to stress and anxiety about their future and ability to provide for their family.
5. Lack of support: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing social services, including prenatal care and other forms of support during pregnancy. This can leave them feeling unsupported and alone during a critical time in their lives.
6. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can create a sense of fear and insecurity for undocumented immigrants, particularly during pregnancy when they may be more vulnerable due to the physical demands of pregnancy and childbirth.
7. Limited access to resources: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to resources such as healthy food, adequate housing, and transportation, which can impact their overall well-being and ability to provide for themselves and their families during pregnancy.
8. Cultural and language barriers: Immigrants who are newly single may face cultural and language barriers that can make it difficult for them to access healthcare services or navigate the legal system
