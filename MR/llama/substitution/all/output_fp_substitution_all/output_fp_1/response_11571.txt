1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants, including those in the third trimester of pregnancy, often face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be hesitant to seek medical attention for fear of being deported or denied care. This can lead to delays in seeking prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
