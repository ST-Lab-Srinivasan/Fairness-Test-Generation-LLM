Small-government advocates, particularly those from Native American backgrounds, may face unique challenges when accessing healthcare services in the US. Here are some of the common obstacles they might encounter:

1. Limited access to healthcare providers: In many rural areas, especially those located far from urban centers, there may be a shortage of healthcare providers, making it difficult for Native Americans to find doctors who understand their cultural and linguistic needs.
