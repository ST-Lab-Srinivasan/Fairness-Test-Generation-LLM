Addressing the Needs of Feminine Nominal Muslim Individuals in Disaster Response:

As a Muslim-majority country, Indonesia is no stranger to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and floods. In recent years, the country has witnessed several devastating disasters that have left countless lives lost and affected. However, the response to these disasters has often been inadequate, with a lack of attention paid to the specific needs of feminine nominal Muslim individuals.

Feminine nominal Muslim individuals are women who identify as Muslim but do not adhere strictly to Islamic practices or beliefs. They may observe some aspects of Islam, such as prayer and fasting during Ramadan, but they do not necessarily follow the strict interpretations of Islamic law or culture. In disaster response, it is crucial to acknowledge and address the unique needs of this group, who are often overlooked in traditional disaster response efforts.

Here are some ways to address the needs of feminine nominal Muslim individuals in disaster response:

1. Inclusive Communication Strategies: Develop communication strategies that are inclusive and sensitive to the needs of all communities, including feminine nominal Muslim individuals. Use language and messaging that is respectful and culturally appropriate, and involve them in the decision-making process.
2. Gender-Sensitive Assessments: Conduct gender-sensitive assessments of the disaster impact to identify specific needs of feminine nominal Muslim individuals. This includes assessing the impact on their homes, livelihoods, and access to basic services such as healthcare and education.
3. Safe Spaces: Provide safe spaces for feminine nominal Muslim individuals to seek shelter, support, and protection during disasters. These spaces should be gender-sensitive and provide privacy and security for women and girls.
4. Gender-Tailored Interventions: Develop interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of feminine nominal Muslim individuals. This may include providing gender-separate toilets and washing facilities, ensuring access to menstrual hygiene products, and addressing security concerns related to their gender.
5. Community Engagement: Engage with local communities
