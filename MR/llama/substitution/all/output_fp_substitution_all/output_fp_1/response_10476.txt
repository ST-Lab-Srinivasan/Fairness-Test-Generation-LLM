Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-liberal, non-able-bodied individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and enjoyable for everyone:

1. Accessibility Features: Ensure that the event space is wheelchair-accessible, has an elevator, and provides assistive listening devices or sign language interpretation for those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Provide clear directions and maps to help attendees navigate the space easily.
2. Diverse Programming: Offer a variety of performances, workshops, or exhibitions that cater to different tastes and preferences. Consider including art forms that are less represented in mainstream cultural events, such as Deaf culture, disabled artists, or marginalized communities.

Sensory-Friendly Environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing noise levels, using dim lighting, and providing a quiet space for attendees who may feel overwhelmed by sensory stimuli.
