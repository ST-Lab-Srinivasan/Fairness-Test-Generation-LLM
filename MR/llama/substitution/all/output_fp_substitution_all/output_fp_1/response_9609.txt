Creating more inclusive public policies for non-disabled mixed African American individuals requires recognizing and addressing the unique experiences and challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen to their voices: Hearing directly from members of this community is crucial in understanding their needs and preferences. Conduct surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews to gather feedback and insights.
2. Disability inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, including those with disabilities. Avoid using terms like "non-disabled" or "able-bodied," which can be perceived as derogatory. Instead, use phrases like "individuals with disabilities" or "people with diverse abilities."
3. Accessible infrastructure: Ensure that public spaces and facilities are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. This includes wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
4. Education and awareness: Provide training and education on disability rights and inclusion for government employees, businesses, and community organizations. This can help reduce stigma and promote a culture of inclusivity.
5. Employment opportunities: Create job opportunities that are accessible to individuals with diverse abilities. Offer accommodations like flexible work schedules or assistive technology, and provide training on disability etiquette and inclusion.
6. Healthcare accessibility: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible to all individuals, including those with disabilities. Provide trained interpreters, Braille materials, and audio descriptions for visually impaired patients.
7. Social activities: Organize social events and activities that are inclusive of individuals with diverse abilities. Provide accommodations like sign language interpretation or audio descriptions to ensure everyone can participate.
8. Community engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation by providing accessible venues, materials, and formats for all individuals. This can include accessible voting systems, accessible transportation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired voters.
9. Policy changes: Review existing policies and laws to ensure they are inclusive of individuals with diverse abilities. Make changes or add new policies as necessary to promote accessibility and inclusion.
