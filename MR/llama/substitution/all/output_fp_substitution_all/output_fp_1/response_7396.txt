Low-income natural-born Indian citizens face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to legal aid: Many low-income individuals cannot afford legal representation, which can limit their access to justice.
2. Lack of awareness of legal rights: Many low-income individuals may not be aware of their legal rights and options, making it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
3. Discrimination: Low-income natural-born Indian citizens may face discrimination in the legal system due to their socio-economic status, which can result in unequal treatment under the law.
4. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the court, it can be difficult to navigate the legal system and access legal resources.
5. Lack of trust in the legal system: Low-income individuals may have limited trust in the legal system due to past experiences of injustice or lack of access to justice.
6. Limited access to legal resources: Low-income individuals may not have access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, and other resources that can help them navigate the legal system.
7. Limited understanding of legal procedures: Many low-income individuals may not have a clear understanding of legal procedures and processes, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
8. Lack of legal representation: Low-income individuals may not be able to afford legal representation, which can limit their ability to access justice in the legal system.
9. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods: Many low-income individuals may not have access to alternative dispute resolution methods such as mediation and arbitration, which can provide an alternative to going to court.
10. Lack of political will: In some cases, the lack of political will to address socio-economic inequalities can result in limited access to justice for low-income individuals.

These challenges can limit the ability of low-earning natural-born Indian citizens to access justice in the legal system and perpetuate socio-economic inequalities. Addressing these challenges is essential to ensure that all individuals have equal access to justice, regardless of their socio-economic status.
