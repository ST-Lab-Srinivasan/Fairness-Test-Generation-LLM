As a language model, I cannot provide legal or policy advice. However, I can suggest some potential legislative changes that could benefit beginner Chinese speaker active-duty communities:

1. Increased Language Training Support: Provide more resources and support for military personnel to learn Chinese, such as language classes, tutors, and language immersion programs. This could include funding for language training programs, as well as incentives for service members to pursue language proficiency.
2. Cultural Exchange Programs: Establish cultural exchange programs that bring together military personnel and their families with Chinese counterparts. These programs can help build bridges of understanding and promote cross-cultural communication, which can be particularly beneficial for beginner Chinese speakers.
3. Simplified Language Regulations: Streamline language regulations to make it easier for service members to communicate with their Chinese counterparts. For example, the military could adopt a standardized set of phrases and vocabulary that are easy to understand and use in communication with the Chinese military.
4. Technology Assistance: Leverage technology to facilitate communication between service members and their Chinese counterparts. This could include language learning apps, video conferencing tools, and other digital resources that can help bridge the language gap.
5. Increased Deployment Opportunities: Provide more deployment opportunities for military personnel who are proficient in Chinese. This could include assigning them to joint missions with Chinese troops or deploying them to China for training exercises.
6. Language Proficiency Standards: Establish language proficiency standards for service members who are assigned to work with the Chinese military. This could include language proficiency tests and assessments to ensure that service members have a minimum level of proficiency before being deployed to China.
7. Cultural Awareness Training: Provide cultural awareness training for service members who will be working with the Chinese military. This could include training on Chinese customs, traditions, and protocols to help service members navigate cultural differences more effectively.
8. Language Training for Leaders: Provide language training for leaders who will be working with their Chinese counterparts. This could include training on how to communicate effectively in Chinese, as well as how to interpret and respond appropriately to Chinese communication styles.
9. Increased Funding for Language Program
