There are several challenges that Mandarin-speaking unmarried people may face in the job market:

1. Lack of language skills: Many employers prefer to hire candidates who are proficient in both spoken and written Mandarin, as it is the official language of China. If an unmarried person's Mandarin skills are not up to par, they may be at a disadvantage when applying for jobs.
2. Limited work experience: Many unmarried people may not have had the opportunity to gain work experience due to various reasons such as education or personal circumstances. This can make it difficult for them to compete with more experienced job applicants.
3. Stereotypes and biases: Unfortunately, there are still many stereotypes and biases against unmarried people in some parts of the world. These can affect their chances of being hired or promoted.
4. Difficulty finding jobs in certain industries: Some industries may be less open to hiring unmarried people, especially if they are seen as a "risk" or "liability". For example, some companies may be hesitant to hire unmarried people for positions that require a high level of trust and reliability.
5. Lack of job opportunities: In some regions, there may be limited job opportunities for unmarried people, particularly in rural or remote areas. This can make it difficult for them to find employment, especially if they do not have access to job listings or resources.
6. Difficulty negotiating salary: Unmarried people may face challenges when it comes to negotiating salary due to a lack of financial stability or support from a spouse or partner. This can make it difficult for them to secure fair compensation for their work.
7. Limited benefits: Some companies may not offer the same level of benefits to unmarried employees as they do to married ones. For example, some companies may offer maternity leave or family-related benefits that are only available to married employees.
8. Difficulty balancing work and personal life: Unmarried people may face challenges in balancing their work and personal life, particularly if they do not have a spouse or partner to share responsibilities with. This can make it difficult for them to manage their workload
