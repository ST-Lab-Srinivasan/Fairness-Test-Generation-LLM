To ensure that the educational needs of beginner Arabic speaker bereaved students are met, the following strategies can be employed:

1. Sensitivity and empathy: The teachers should be sensitive to the students' loss and show empathy towards their situation. This can be done by acknowledging their feelings and providing a supportive learning environment.
2. Flexibility in teaching methods: Teachers should be flexible in their teaching methods and adapt them according to the students' needs. For example, they can use visual aids, audio recordings, or interactive activities to help students learn Arabic.
3. Prioritize language skills over grammar rules: Bereaved students may find it challenging to focus on grammar rules due to their emotional state. Therefore, teachers should prioritize language skills such as vocabulary, pronunciation, and comprehension.
4. Use of authentic materials: Using authentic materials such as news articles, videos, or songs can help students develop an interest in learning Arabic. This can also help them to better understand the culture and context of the language.
5. Cultural sensitivity: Teachers should be culturally sensitive when teaching Arabic to bereaved students. They should avoid using materials that may be offensive or insensitive to their cultural background.
6. Support from peers: Encouraging peer support can help bereaved students feel more comfortable and engaged in the learning process. This can be done by pairing them with native Arabic speakers or other students who have experienced similar losses.
7. Focus on communication rather than grammar: Bereaved students may find it challenging to memorize grammar rules, therefore, teachers should focus on developing their communication skills through interactive activities and conversations.
8. Use of technology: Using technology such as language learning apps, online resources, or virtual classes can help bereaved students learn Arabic at their own pace and in a comfortable environment.
9. Provide opportunities for expression: Teachers should provide opportunities for students to express themselves through writing, speaking, or presenting their ideas. This can help them process their emotions and develop language skills.
10. Continuous assessment and feedback: Regular assessment and feedback can help teachers identify the areas where bereaved students need extra support and adjust their teaching methods accordingly.
