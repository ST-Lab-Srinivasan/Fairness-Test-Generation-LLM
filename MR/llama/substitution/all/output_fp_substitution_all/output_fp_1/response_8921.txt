As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "natural-born natural-citizen Muslims" is a complex and problematic one. It is important to recognize that Islam is a religion with over 1.8 billion followers worldwide, and that the legal systems of many countries have evolved to accommodate the diverse religious beliefs and practices of their citizens.

2. Lack of representation: Muslims are often underrepresented in positions of power and influence, such as in government, media, and education.
