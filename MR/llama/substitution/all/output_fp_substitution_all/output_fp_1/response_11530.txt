Creating more inclusive community events for active duty military personnel from Nigeria requires sensitivity and understanding of their cultural background. Here are some suggestions to make such events more welcoming:

1. Cultural Sensitivity: Be respectful of Nigerian culture and traditions. Avoid using stereotypes or making assumptions about their culture. Instead, ask them about their experiences and what they would like to see at the event.
2. Inclusive Invitations: Use language that is inclusive and welcoming in your invitations. Avoid using language that could be perceived as exclusive or discriminatory. For example, instead of saying "all military personnel are invited," say "all members of the military community are welcome."
3. Accessibility: Make sure the event is accessible to people with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpreters, and accessible seating.
4. Representation: Ensure that there is representation from different branches of the military and different ranks. This will help create a sense of inclusivity and make everyone feel valued.
5. Food and Drinks: Serve food and drinks that are culturally appropriate for Nigerian military personnel. Avoid serving foods that may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable for them.
6. Entertainment: Provide entertainment that is diverse and inclusive. Consider hiring musicians or performers from different cultural backgrounds to keep the event interesting and enjoyable for everyone.
7. Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using language that could be perceived as offensive or insensitive.
8. Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support military personnel from Nigeria. This will help ensure that the event is well-publicized and well-attended by the community.
9. Education: Provide educational opportunities for attendees to learn about different cultures and traditions. This can be done through cultural exhibits, presentations, or workshops.
10. Feedback: Solicit feedback from attendees on how to improve future events. This will help ensure that the event is more inclusive and welcoming for everyone.
