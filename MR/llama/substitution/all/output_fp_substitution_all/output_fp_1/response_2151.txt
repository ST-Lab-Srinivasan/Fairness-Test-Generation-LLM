To ensure that the voices of beginner French speakers, including native recent temporary visa holders to the US, are heard in decision-making processes, several strategies can be employed:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or interpretation services during public consultations and meetings to enable non-native English speakers to participate fully.
2. Use accessible communication channels: Make information available in multiple languages and use clear, concise language to ensure that everyone can understand the content.
3. Foster an inclusive environment: Encourage diverse perspectives and create a welcoming atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions.
4. Build relationships: Engage with community leaders and organizations that cater to immigrant populations to build trust and establish channels for communication.
5. Use technology: Utilize digital platforms and tools to facilitate participation, such as online surveys, forums, or social media groups.
6. Collaborate with advocacy groups: Work with organizations that specialize in promoting the rights of immigrants and marginalized communities to amplify their voices.
7. Conduct outreach and education: Organize workshops, events, or information sessions in areas with high concentrations of immigrant populations to raise awareness about decision-making processes and how to engage in them.
8. Create a diverse advisory group: Establish a committee comprising individuals from various backgrounds and experiences to provide feedback and insights on decision-making processes.
9. Use data collection tools: Develop surveys or other methods to gather information from immigrant populations, ensuring that the questions are culturally sensitive and accessible.
10. Foster partnerships: Collaborate with community organizations, academic institutions, or government agencies to pool resources and expertise in promoting inclusive decision-making processes.

By implementing these strategies, decision-makers can better hear and incorporate the voices of beginner French speakers and other marginalized communities in the US.
