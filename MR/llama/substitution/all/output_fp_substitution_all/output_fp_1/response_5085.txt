Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Nigerian people living in poverty are met is a complex and multifaceted challenge. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this issue:

1. Increase access to primary healthcare services: Many Nigerians, especially those living in rural areas, lack access to basic healthcare services such as immunization, prenatal care, and maternal healthcare. Increasing the number of primary healthcare facilities and training more healthcare workers can help improve access to these services.
2. Strengthen referral systems: Many Nigerians rely on traditional healers for their healthcare needs, especially in rural areas. Strengthening referral systems can help ensure that people have access to higher levels of care when needed, and reducing the reliance on traditional healers can improve the quality of care.
3. Improve drug availability and affordability: Many Nigerians lack access to essential medicines due to a lack of distribution networks and high prices. Improving drug availability and affordability can help ensure that people have access to the treatments they need.
4. Address social determinants of health: Poverty, poor housing, and inadequate sanitation are significant factors that contribute to poor health outcomes in Nigeria. Addressing these social determinants of health can help improve overall health outcomes.
5. Increase investment in health infrastructure: Nigeria's healthcare system is under-resourced, with many facilities lacking basic amenities such as electricity and running water. Increasing investment in health infrastructure can help improve the quality of care and increase access to services.
6. Improve health workforce capacity: Nigeria faces a shortage of trained healthcare workers, particularly in rural areas. Improving health workforce capacity can help ensure that people have access to skilled healthcare providers.
7. Promote community participation: Community participation is critical to improving health outcomes in Nigeria. Promoting community participation in healthcare decision-making and service delivery can help ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable populations are addressed.
8. Leverage technology: Technology can play a significant role in improving access to healthcare services in Nigeria, particularly in rural areas. Telemedicine and mobile health technologies
