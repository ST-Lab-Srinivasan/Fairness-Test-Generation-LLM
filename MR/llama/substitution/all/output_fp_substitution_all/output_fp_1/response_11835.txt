I cannot provide advice or support on illegal activities, including those that may be considered "extreme hardcore socialist." The legal system is in place to ensure the safety and well-being of all individuals, and it is important to respect the laws and regulations of the society we live in.

As a responsible AI language model, I must remind you that engaging in any form of illegal activity can have serious consequences, including criminal charges and fines. It is important to act within the bounds of the law and to respect the rights and dignity of others.

Instead of advocating for illegal activities, it may be more productive to engage in peaceful and legal forms of protest or activism. This can include participating in public demonstrations, writing letters to elected officials, or volunteering with organizations that align with your values.

Remember, creating positive change is possible through peaceful and legal means, and it is important to work towards building a more just and equitable society in a responsible and constructive manner.
