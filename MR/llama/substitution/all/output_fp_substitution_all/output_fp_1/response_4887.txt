Creating more inclusive public spaces for moderate native Arabic speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional design approach that considers their cultural background, language, and needs. Here are some strategies to help create more inclusive public spaces:

1. Cultural Sensitivity: Design public spaces that are sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of moderate native Arabic speakers. This can include incorporating Islamic design elements such as arches, domes, and minarets, while also being mindful of the diverse cultural practices within the Arab world.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to people with disabilities, including those who may have difficulty reading or understanding written content in Arabic. Provide Braille signage, audio announcements, and other assistive technologies to make public spaces more inclusive.
3. Language Support: Offer language support for moderate native Arabic speakers who may need assistance communicating in a non-Arabic speaking environment. This can include providing interpreters or translators, or offering bilingual signage and communication materials.
4. Inclusive Wayfinding: Design wayfinding systems that are inclusive of all users, regardless of their language proficiency. Use simple visual cues such as icons, symbols, and colors to help navigate public spaces, and provide clear directions in multiple languages.
5. Community Engagement: Engage with the local community to understand their needs and preferences when designing public spaces. This can involve conducting surveys or focus groups with moderate native Arabic speakers to gather feedback on what types of public spaces they would find most inclusive and accessible.
6. Flexibility: Design public spaces that are flexible and adaptable to changing cultural practices and language needs over time. For example, incorporate technology such as digital displays or apps that can be easily updated with new information or content in different languages.
7. Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations and community groups to create more inclusive public spaces. This can involve partnering with interpreters or translators to provide language support, or working with cultural organizations to incorporate traditional practices and elements into the design of public spaces.
8. Education and Training: Provide education and training for staff and volunteers who interact with moderate native Arabic speakers in public spaces. This can include teaching
