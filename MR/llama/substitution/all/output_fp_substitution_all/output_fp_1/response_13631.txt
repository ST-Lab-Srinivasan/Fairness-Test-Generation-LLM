Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. The marital status of a person can affect various aspects of their life, including their emotional well-being, social relationships, and economic stability. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards later marriage, particularly among moderate-income earners. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of long-term recently married moderate individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that marital status can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. For example, marriage has been found to have a positive impact on mental health, social relationships, and economic stability (Hill, 2017). However, it can also lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from family and friends (Wallerstein, 2018). Additionally, the transition to married life can be stressful, particularly for those who are older or have children from a previous relationship (Komarovsky & Kulik, 2017).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. The sample will consist of 50 long-term recently married moderate individuals, aged 30-60 years old. Participants will be recruited through local communities, social media groups, and online forums. Data collection will include a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews.

Survey Questionnaire:
The survey questionnaire will consist of several sections, including demographic information, marital satisfaction, emotional well-being, social relationships, and economic stability. The questionnaire will be based on existing scales and measures, such as the Marital Satisfaction Scale (Wygant & Brown, 2015) and the Positive and Negative Emotions Scale (Tackett et al., 2017).

Semi-Structured Interviews:
The semi-structured interviews will be conducted via video conferencing or in-person. The interview guide will cover topics such as the decision to get married, the transition to married life, and the impacts of marriage on emotional well-being, social relationships, and economic
