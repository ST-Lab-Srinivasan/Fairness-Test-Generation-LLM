Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native Arabic speakers who are also native natural-born US citizens. These individuals have a unique dual identity, shaped by their cultural background and their American citizenship. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences their lives:

1. Language and communication: For many native Arabic speakers in the US, their language skills are an important part of their cultural identity. They may use Arabic at home with family and friends, or in community settings like mosques or Arabic language classes. However, they may also feel pressure to conform to American language norms in professional and social settings, which can lead to feelings of linguistic duality.
2. Cultural traditions and practices: Native Arabic speakers may observe Islamic practices like prayer, fasting during Ramadan, and celebrating Eid-al-Fitr and Eid-al-Adha. They may also participate in cultural events like Middle Eastern festivals, weddings, and funerals. These experiences help them connect with their heritage and maintain a sense of identity.
3. Food and culinary traditions: Arabic cuisine is known for its rich flavors and spices, and native speakers may enjoy cooking and sharing traditional dishes like kebabs, falafel, and baklava. They may also feel a sense of nostalgia or longing when eating these foods, as they remind them of their cultural heritage.
4. Identity formation: Growing up in the US as a native Arabic speaker can be challenging, particularly during times of conflict or tension between the US and Middle Eastern countries.

They may also face discrimination or bias based on their cultural background, which can impact their sense of self and belonging.
5. Community engagement: For many native Arabic speakers, community is an essential aspect of their cultural identity.
