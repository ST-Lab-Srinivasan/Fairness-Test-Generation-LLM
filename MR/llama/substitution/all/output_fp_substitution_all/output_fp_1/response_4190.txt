2. Cultural differences: Japan has a unique culture and work environment that may be unfamiliar to native English speakers. Understanding the cultural nuances and customs of Japan is essential to navigating the job market successfully.

6. Different work hours and schedules: Japan has a unique work culture that may differ significantly from what native English speakers are used to.
