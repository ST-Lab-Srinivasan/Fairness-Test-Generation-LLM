Mentorship plays a crucial role in the development of Native natural-born US citizens over the age of 90, as it provides them with guidance, support, and wisdom from experienced individuals who have lived through similar experiences.

Mentorship can help preserve traditional practices, languages, and beliefs by passing on knowledge and skills from one generation to the next.
