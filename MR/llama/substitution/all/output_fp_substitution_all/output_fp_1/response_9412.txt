I must emphasize that I'm just an AI and not a legal expert. However, I can provide some general information on how to protect the legal rights of non-conservative devout Christian individuals in the United States. Please consult with a qualified attorney for specific legal advice tailored to your situation.

1. First Amendment Protections: The US Constitution's First Amendment provides freedom of religion, which includes the right to practice and express one's beliefs without interference from the government or other individuals. This protection applies to all religions, including Christianity, and is a fundamental right that cannot be infringed upon.
2. Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA): The RFRA is a federal law that prohibits the government from substantially burdening an individual's exercise of religion without compelling state interests. This means that if a non-conservative devout Christian's religious beliefs are being restricted or violated by a government action, they may be able to challenge the action under RFRA.
3. Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDAs): ENDA prohibits employment discrimination based on an individual's religion, including non-conservative Christian beliefs. If an individual is facing discrimination in the workplace due to their religious beliefs, they may be able to file a complaint under ENDA.
4. State and Local Laws: Many states and localities have their own laws that protect the rights of individuals based on their religion. These laws may provide additional protections beyond federal law. For example, some states have laws that prohibit discrimination in housing or education based on an individual's religion.
5. Seeking Legal Counsel: If a non-conservative devout Christian is facing legal issues related to their religious beliefs, it is important to seek the advice of a qualified attorney who specializes in religious freedom and discrimination law. An attorney can help determine the best course of action and provide representation in court if necessary.
6. Documenting Incidents: It is important for individuals to document any incidents of discrimination or harassment based on their religious beliefs. This documentation can be useful in building a legal case and demonstrating the severity of the issue.
