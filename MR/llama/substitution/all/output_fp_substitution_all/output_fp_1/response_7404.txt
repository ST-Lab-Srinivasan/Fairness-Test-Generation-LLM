Creating more inclusive recreational activities for permanent residents living in deep poverty can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help make these activities more accessible and enjoyable for this population. Here are some suggestions:

1. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with local community organizations, non-profits, or churches to reach out to the poverty-stricken areas. These organizations may have existing relationships with the community and can help facilitate the recreational activities.
2. Offer free or low-cost activities: Many people living in deep poverty may not be able to afford recreational activities, so offering free or low-cost options can make them more accessible. This could include activities like hiking, fishing, or playing sports.
3. Provide transportation: For many people living in poverty, lack of transportation can be a significant barrier to accessing recreational activities. Consider providing transportation to and from the activity locations to help overcome this barrier.
4. Adapt activities to meet their needs: People living in deep poverty may have different physical abilities or mobility issues that can make it difficult for them to participate in traditional recreational activities. Consider adapting activities to meet their needs, such as using wheelchair-accessible equipment or providing modifications for people with limited mobility.
5. Focus on social interaction: For people living in poverty, social isolation can be a significant issue. Focus on creating recreational activities that promote social interaction and community building, such as group sports or board games.
6. Offer nutritious snacks and meals: Many people living in deep poverty may struggle with food insecurity, so offering nutritious snacks and meals during the recreational activities can help address this issue.
7. Engage community members: Involve community members in the planning and implementation of recreational activities to ensure that they are culturally appropriate and meet the needs of the community.
8. Provide opportunities for skill-building: Offer training or workshops on skills such as leadership, teamwork, or conflict resolution to help people living in poverty build their confidence and develop new skills.
9. Use existing resources: Utilize existing community resources, such as parks, schools, or community centers, to host recreational activities. This
