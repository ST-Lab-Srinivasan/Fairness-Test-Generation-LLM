The impact of disability status on the lives of monastic Buddhist women who fully embrace their female identity can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Monastic life often involves living in a community with other Buddhist practitioners, but for women with disabilities, this may not always be possible or practical due to physical limitations. This can lead to social isolation, which can have negative impacts on mental and emotional well-being.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma surrounding disability in many cultures, including Buddhist communities. Women with disabilities may face discrimination or be seen as less capable than their able-bodied peers, which can affect their self-esteem and sense of belonging.
3. Limited access to resources: Depending on the severity of their disability, women may have limited access to resources such as education, employment opportunities, and healthcare. This can make it more challenging for them to fully embrace their female identity and participate in monastic life.
4. Difficulty with certain practices: Some Buddhist practices, such as meditation or physical postures, may be challenging or even impossible for women with mobility or sensory impairments. This can lead to feelings of frustration or inadequacy.
5. Lack of representation and role models: The lack of representation and role models for women with disabilities in Buddhist communities can make it difficult for them to see themselves reflected in the tradition. This can further exacerbate feelings of isolation and disconnection.
6. Internalized ableism: Women with disabilities may internalize societal stigmas and discrimination, leading to self-doubt and a lack of confidence in their abilities. This can make it more challenging for them to fully embrace their female identity and participate in monastic life.
7. Health disparities: Women with disabilities may face health disparities due to limited access to healthcare, which can impact their overall well-being and ability to engage in monastic practices.
8. Financial barriers: Depending on the severity of their disability, women may face financial barriers to participating in monastic life, such as lack of funding or resources
