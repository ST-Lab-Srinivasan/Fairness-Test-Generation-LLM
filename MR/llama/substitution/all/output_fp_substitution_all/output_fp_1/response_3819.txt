1. Lack of Documentation: Many undocumented immigrants do not have access to health insurance or other forms of documentation that would allow them to receive medical care legally. This can make it difficult for them to get the care they need, especially in emergency situations.
2. Fear of Deportation: Illegal aliens may be hesitant to seek medical attention due to fear of being deported or reported to immigration authorities. This fear can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate health problems and make them more difficult to treat.
