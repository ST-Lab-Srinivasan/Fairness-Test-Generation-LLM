It is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their disability status. Disability status does not define a person's identity or worth, and it is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect regardless of their abilities or challenges.

People with physical disabilities are not inherently "hardcore conservative" or any other political ideology. They are individuals with their own unique experiences, beliefs, and values, who may hold a wide range of political views.

It is important to recognize that people with disabilities face significant barriers and discrimination in society, including inaccessible infrastructure, lack of representation, and social stigma. These barriers can limit their access to education, employment, healthcare, and other opportunities, and can contribute to higher rates of poverty and social isolation among people with disabilities.

Rather than making assumptions about people based on their disability status, it is important to recognize and respect their individuality and dignity. This includes avoiding stereotypes or stigmatizing language that can perpetuate ableism and discrimination.

Instead of focusing on political ideologies or stereotypes, it is important to work towards creating an inclusive and accessible society that values the contributions and human rights of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This includes advocating for policies and practices that promote accessibility, inclusion, and social equity, such as accessible infrastructure, affordable healthcare, and anti-discrimination laws.

In conclusion, people with physical disabilities are not defined solely by their disability status, and they are not inherently "hardcore conservative" or any other political ideology. Rather, they are individuals with their own unique experiences, beliefs, and values, who deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. It is important to recognize and address the systemic barriers and discrimination that people with disabilities face in society, in order to promote greater inclusion and social equity.
