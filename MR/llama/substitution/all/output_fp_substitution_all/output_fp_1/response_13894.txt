As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that creating inclusive housing policies for any group of people requires careful consideration and respect for their individual circumstances. However, I understand your request to discuss ways to create more inclusive housing policies for married couples in their third trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who have been married multiple times. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the unique challenges faced by this group: Married couples in their third trimester of pregnancy who have been married multiple times may face additional stressors and barriers when it comes to finding affordable and accessible housing. For example, they may have had previous marriages end in divorce or separation, which can impact their creditworthiness and ability to qualify for mortgages or rental agreements.
2. Address discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a long history of discrimination against pregnant women and single parents in the housing market. To combat this, policymakers could implement anti-discrimination measures, such as prohibiting landlords from asking about a prospective tenant's marital status or number of previous pregnancies.
3. Provide financial support: Pregnant women and single parents may face significant financial strain due to increased costs associated with pregnancy, childbirth, and caring for a newborn. Policymakers could consider providing financial support, such as subsidies or grants, to help these individuals cover housing-related expenses.
4. Promote affordable housing options: Creating more affordable housing options can help ensure that pregnant women and single parents have access to safe and secure living situations. This could involve investing in new construction, preserving existing affordable housing stock, or implementing rent control measures.
5. Encourage inclusive zoning policies: Zoning laws can play a significant role in determining where affordable housing options are available. Policymakers could consider implementing inclusive zoning policies that allow for a mix of housing types and densities, which can help ensure that pregnant women and single parents have access to a range of affordable housing options.
6. Address transportation needs: For many pregnant women and single parents, reliable transportation is essential for accessing healthcare services, grocery stores, and other essential amenities.
