Ensuring that the healthcare needs of deep poverty Nigerian people are met is a complex challenge that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented:

1. Increase access to primary healthcare: Deep poverty communities often lack access to basic healthcare services, such as routine check-ups, vaccinations, and maternal and child healthcare.
