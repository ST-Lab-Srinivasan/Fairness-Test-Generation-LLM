Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native American recent refugees to the US, particularly those from soft socialist backgrounds. Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and encouragement, helping these individuals navigate their new surroundings, adapt to the local culture, and build a better life for themselves and their families. Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to their development:

1. Cultural understanding and integration: As Native American recent refugees come from diverse backgrounds, they may face challenges in adjusting to the dominant culture of the US. A mentor can help them understand local customs, laws, and social norms, enabling them to navigate these unfamiliar territories more effectively.

A mentor who is fluent in the local language can help them learn the language, improve their communication skills, and increase their overall participation in society.
