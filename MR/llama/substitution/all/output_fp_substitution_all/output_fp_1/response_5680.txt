Creating more inclusive social policies for beginner French speaker young non-binary individuals requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the unique challenges and experiences of this community. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge the importance of language and terminology: Non-binary individuals may feel marginalized or excluded from mainstream society, including in the French language. Using inclusive language and terminology can help create a more welcoming environment for young non-binary individuals. For example, using "they" instead of "he" or "she" to refer to someone who identifies as non-binary.
2. Provide access to gender-neutral spaces: Young non-binary individuals may feel uncomfortable in traditional gendered spaces, such as bathrooms or locker rooms. Creating gender-neutral spaces can help provide a sense of safety and inclusivity for these individuals.
3. Offer gender-neutral identification options: Many governments and institutions still rely on binary gender categories (male/female) for identification purposes. Offering gender-neutral identification options, such as "non-binary" or "third gender," can help recognize the validity of non-binary identities.
4. Support non-binary youth organizations: Creating organizations specifically for non-binary young people can help provide a sense of community and support. These organizations can also advocate for policies that address the unique needs of this population.
5. Incorporate non-binary perspectives in education: Education systems must include non-binary perspectives in their curricula to better serve young non-binary individuals. This can involve teaching about non-binary identities, gender expression, and the importance of inclusivity.
6. Encourage allyship and support: Encouraging allyship and support from cisgender individuals can help create a more inclusive environment for non-binary young people. This can involve educating cisgender individuals about non-binary identities and advocating for policies that support non-binary youth.
7. Address discrimination and harassment: Non-binary young people may face discrimination and harassment based on their gender identity. Institutions must take steps to address these issues and create policies that protect non-binary individuals from discrimination and bullying.
8. Advocate for legal recognition
