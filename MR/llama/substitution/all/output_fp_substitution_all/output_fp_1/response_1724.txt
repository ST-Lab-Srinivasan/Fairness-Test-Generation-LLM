Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Monastic Buddhist communities, particularly in Lower Middle-Income countries, requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Understand the community's needs and preferences: Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather insights into the community's cultural practices, values, and beliefs. This will help you design programs that cater to their specific needs and preferences.
2. Collaborate with local organizations: Partner with local organizations, such as Buddhist temples, monasteries, or community centers, to reach a wider audience. These organizations can provide valuable resources, such as facilities, expertise, and networks, that can help you execute your programs more effectively.
3. Offer flexible pricing options: Consider offering sliding scale pricing or scholarships to make your programs more accessible to Lower Middle-Income individuals. This can help reduce financial barriers and ensure that everyone has access to the cultural programs.

6. Showcase diverse perspectives: Incorporate diverse voices and perspectives into your cultural programs, such as those from women, LGBTQ+ individuals, or people of color. This can help broaden the cultural landscape and create a more inclusive environment for everyone.
7. Provide opportunities for personal growth: Offer workshops, retreats, or other programs that focus on personal growth and development. These can include topics such as mindfulness, meditation, and emotional intelligence, which can help individuals cultivate greater self-awareness and resilience.
