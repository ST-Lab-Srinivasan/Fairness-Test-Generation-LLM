To use data to highlight the issues faced by beginner French speakers and English speakers, you could consider the following steps:

1. Collect data: Gather data on the language proficiency levels of individuals in both French and English. This can be done through surveys, language assessments, or other methods.
2. Analyze the data: Examine the data to identify patterns and trends in the language proficiency levels of beginner learners. For example, you may find that a large percentage of beginners struggle with basic grammar rules or have difficulty understanding spoken language.
3. Create visualizations: Use statistical visualizations such as bar graphs, line charts, or heat maps to display the data in an easily digestible format. This will help highlight the issues faced by beginner learners and make it easier to identify areas where they need improvement.
4. Identify themes: Look for common themes that emerge from the data, such as the most common grammar mistakes made by beginner French speakers or the most challenging aspects of learning English for non-native speakers.
5. Create a report: Compile the data and visualizations into a report that highlights the key issues faced by beginner learners. This report can be used to inform language instruction and support programs, or to guide the development of resources and materials specifically designed to address the needs of beginner learners.
6. Share the findings: Present the report and its findings to relevant stakeholders, such as language instructors, administrators, or policymakers. This will help ensure that the data is used to improve language learning outcomes for beginner learners.

Some possible data sources include:

* Language proficiency assessments: Use standardized language assessments, such as the French Language Proficiency Test (FLPT) or the English Language Proficiency Assessment (ELPA), to gauge the language proficiency levels of beginner learners.
* Surveys: Conduct surveys to gather information on the learning experiences and challenges faced by beginner learners. This can include questions about their language learning goals, the resources they use, and the difficulties they encounter.
* Observational data: Collect data on the language use and communication patterns of beginner learners in real-world contexts, such as language exchange events or conversation groups.
