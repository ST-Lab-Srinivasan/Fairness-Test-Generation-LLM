As a native Chinese speaker in the age range of 13-15, there are several challenges that I may face in the healthcare system. Here are some potential issues:

1. Language barriers: As a non-native English speaker, I may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak Chinese fluently. This could lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about my medical history, symptoms, or treatment options.
