Promoting the educational success of ethnically full Asian students, particularly those who are progressive and identify with multiple marginalized identities, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. Here are some strategies that educators and policymakers can consider:

1. Culturally Relevant Curriculum: Develop curriculum that reflects the experiences, histories, and cultures of ethnically full Asian students. This includes incorporating diverse perspectives, voices, and stories into the classroom, and teaching critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are grounded in cultural competence.
2. Inclusive Classrooms: Foster inclusive classrooms where all students feel seen, heard, and valued. This involves creating a safe space for ethnically full Asian students to share their experiences and perspectives, and addressing microaggressions and biases that may exist in the classroom.
3. Identity-Based Support: Provide support groups or safe spaces where ethnically full Asian students can connect with peers who share similar identities and experiences. This can help build a sense of community and belonging, which is critical for academic success.
4. Teacher Training: Provide training for teachers on how to teach diverse student populations, including ethnically full Asian students. This may involve learning about the cultural backgrounds and experiences of these students, as well as strategies for inclusive teaching and curriculum design.
5. Family Engagement: Engage with the families of ethnically full Asian students to build a stronger support network. This involves communicating with parents in their native languages, sharing information about their child's academic progress, and involving them in decision-making processes related to their child's education.
6. Community Partnerships: Develop partnerships with community organizations that serve ethnically full Asian students and their families. These partnerships can provide additional resources and support for students, such as tutoring, mentorship, and cultural enrichment programs.
7. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policies and practices that promote the educational success of ethnically full Asian students. This may involve pushing for changes in curriculum design, teacher training, and school culture to better serve the needs of these students.
