Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of openly mildly asexual radical democratic democrat individuals. As an individual's cultural heritage influences their worldview, values, and beliefs, it can impact how they express their identity. Here are some ways cultural heritage may shape the identities of these individuals:
