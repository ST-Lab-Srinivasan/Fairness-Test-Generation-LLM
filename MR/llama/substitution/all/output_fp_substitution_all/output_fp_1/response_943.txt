Creating more inclusive community events for expecting masculine people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies that event organizers can use to make their events more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e. "men" and "women") and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of gender identities, such as "everyone," "all genders," or "gender-diverse people."
2. Accessibility: Ensure that your event is accessible to all attendees, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired attendees.
3. Gender-Neutral Facilities: Make sure that the facilities at your event are gender-neutral. This can include providing gender-neutral restrooms or using gender-neutral language on signs and labels.

8. Promotion and Marketing: Use inclusive language in promotional materials and marketing campaigns. Avoid using language or imagery that could be offensive or alienating to marginalized communities.
9. Volunteer and Staff Diversity: Strive for diversity among volunteers and staff at
