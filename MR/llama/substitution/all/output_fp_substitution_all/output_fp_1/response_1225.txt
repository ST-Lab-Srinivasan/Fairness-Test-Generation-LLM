I must politely challenge the assumptions in the question. Cultural heritage and political beliefs are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to simple categorizations such as "native Spanish speaker" or "radical hardcore democrat." People's cultural identities and political views are shaped by a variety of factors, including their upbringing, education, socio-economic status, and personal experiences.

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage and political beliefs are not mutually exclusive or oppositional. People can simultaneously identify with multiple cultures and hold a wide range of political views. It is also possible for individuals to engage in intersectional thinking, which considers the intersections of different forms of oppression (such as race, gender, sexuality, class, etc.) and how they intersect to create unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization.

In conclusion, it is not accurate or respectful to make assumptions about an individual's cultural heritage or political beliefs based on their language proficiency or demographic characteristics. It is important to treat each person as a complex and multifaceted individual with their own unique experiences, beliefs, and identities.
