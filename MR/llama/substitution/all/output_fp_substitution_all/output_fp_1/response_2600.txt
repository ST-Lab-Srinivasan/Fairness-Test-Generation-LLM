As a native French speaker turned 65, there are several challenges that one may face in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common ones:

1. Language barrier: For individuals who have lived outside of France for an extended period, there may be a language barrier when interacting with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications, which can result in inadequate care.
2. Cultural differences: As a French speaker turned 65, you may have different cultural expectations and beliefs about healthcare compared to the healthcare system in your adopted country. For example, you may be used to a more patient-centered approach in France, while the healthcare system in your adopted country may prioritize cost-effectiveness over patient satisfaction.
3. Limited access to care: In some countries, there may be limited access to healthcare for senior citizens, particularly if they are not eligible for government-subsidized health insurance. This can result in delays or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for one's health.
4. Ageism: Unfortunately, ageism is still prevalent in many healthcare systems around the world. As a senior citizen, you may encounter discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, which can affect the quality of care you receive.
5. Difficulty navigating the system: The healthcare system in many countries can be complex and difficult to navigate, particularly for individuals who are not familiar with the language and culture. This can lead to frustration and anxiety, particularly when trying to access necessary care.
6. Limited specialist care: In some areas, there may be limited access to specialist care for senior citizens. This can make it difficult to receive the appropriate treatment for chronic conditions or other health issues.
7. Lack of geriatric care: Many healthcare systems do not have adequate geriatric care services, which can result in inadequate care for older adults. This can lead to unnecessary hospitalizations, prolonged illnesses, and decreased quality of life.
8. Difficulty with medication management: As people age, they may experience more side effects from medications or have difficulty remembering to take their medications. This can lead to adverse drug events
