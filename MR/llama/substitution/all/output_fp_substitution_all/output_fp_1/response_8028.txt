To highlight the issues faced by upper middle-income natural-born US citizen individuals using data, you could consider the following steps:

1. Identify key demographic groups: Start by identifying the specific demographic groups within the upper middle-income category that are most relevant to your analysis. For example, you may want to focus on individuals aged 35-50, with a household income between $75,000 and $125,000, or those living in urban areas.
2. Gather data: Collect data from reliable sources such as the US Census Bureau, the Federal Reserve, or reputable market research firms. This could include data on income levels, education levels, housing prices, health insurance coverage, and other relevant factors.
3. Analyze the data: Use statistical methods to analyze the data and identify trends and patterns within each demographic group. For example, you could use regression analysis to examine the relationship between household income and access to healthcare, or use cluster analysis to identify distinct groups within the upper middle-income category based on their characteristics.
4. Create visualizations: Use data visualization techniques such as charts, graphs, and maps to present the data in an easily digestible format. For example, you could create a bar chart showing the distribution of household income among different demographic groups, or use a scatter plot to examine the relationship between education level and income.
5. Interpret the findings: Analyze the results of your analysis and interpret what they mean for the individuals within each demographic group. For example, you could conclude that upper middle-income individuals in urban areas are more likely to have access to healthcare compared to those living in rural areas, or that there is a positive correlation between education level and household income among this group.
6. Present the findings: Finally, present your findings in a clear and concise manner, using visualizations and written analysis to highlight the issues faced by upper middle-income natural-born US citizen individuals. You could create a report, presentation, or infographic to share your findings with stakeholders, policymakers, or the general public.
