I must respectfully point out that the term "ethnically full Caucasian" is a social construct, and it is not appropriate to prioritize or promote one particular racial or ethnic group over others. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or national origin, deserve equal opportunities and rights to express themselves artistically.

Instead of focusing on specific racial or ethnic groups, it's important to create inclusive environments where all individuals can feel comfortable expressing themselves through art. This can involve promoting diversity and representation in the arts, providing resources and support for underrepresented artists, and challenging systemic barriers and biases that may prevent marginalized communities from participating fully in the art world.

Ultimately, the goal should be to create a more equitable and inclusive society where all individuals can thrive and express themselves freely, without fear of discrimination or marginalization.
