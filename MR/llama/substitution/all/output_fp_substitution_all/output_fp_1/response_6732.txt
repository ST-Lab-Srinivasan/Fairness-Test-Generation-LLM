Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-liberal, non-married, and multiple times individuals requires acknowledging and addressing the marginalization of these groups in society. Here are some suggestions to create more inclusive cultural celebrations:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their marital status or number of times they have been married. Avoid using terms that assume a single or monogamous relationship, such as "husband" or "wife." Instead, use terms like "partner," "spouse," or "significant other."
2. Representation Matters: Ensure that the cultural celebrations reflect the diversity of individuals in the community. This can be achieved by including diverse imagery, symbols, and stories in the celebrations. For example, if a cultural celebration typically features heterosexual couples, consider adding same-sex couples or other non-traditional relationships to the visual representation.
3. Inclusive Invitations: When inviting individuals to cultural celebrations, avoid using language that assumes a specific marital status or relationship type. Instead, use inclusive language that welcomes all individuals, regardless of their personal choices. For instance, instead of saying "All married couples are invited," say "All individuals are welcome."
4. Education and Awareness: Educate yourself and others about the experiences and challenges faced by non-liberal, non-married, and multiple times individuals. This can help create a more empathetic and understanding environment for these groups. Encourage dialogue and open discussions to break down stereotypes and misconceptions.
5. Inclusive Traditions: Explore and incorporate traditions that are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their marital status or relationship type. For example, instead of a traditional wedding cake, consider serving a multi-tiered cake that represents the diversity of relationships.
6. Accessibility: Ensure that cultural celebrations are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and braille materials for those who need them.
7. Inclusive Decorations: Use decorations that reflect the diversity of relationships in the community.
