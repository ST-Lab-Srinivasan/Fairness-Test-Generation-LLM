Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of non-disabled beginner Chinese speakers in various ways. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to education and job opportunities: In China, political affiliation can affect access to education and job opportunities, particularly for those in the public sector. For example, being a member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) can provide advantages in obtaining government jobs or scholarships. Non-disabled beginner Chinese speakers who are not members of the CPC may face discrimination or barriers when applying for these opportunities.
2. Social welfare and healthcare: Political affiliation can also influence access to social welfare and healthcare services. In China, the government provides various forms of social welfare and healthcare to its citizens, including disability benefits. However, non-disabled beginner Chinese speakers who are not members of the CPC may face challenges in accessing these services, particularly if they do not have a recognized disability.
