Creating more inclusive social policies for partnered undocumented individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers faced by these individuals. Here are some key considerations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Define "partnered undocumented individuals" broadly: When designing policies, it's essential to define who is included in the term "partnered undocumented individuals." This may include not only spouses or domestic partners but also other family members, such as children, parents, or siblings.
2. Recognize the intersectionality of immigration status and other social categories: Undocumented immigrants often face discrimination and marginalization based on their immigration status, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and other factors. Policies should recognize and address these intersections of oppression to create a more inclusive society.
3. Address the lack of access to social services: Undocumented individuals often face barriers when seeking access to basic social services like healthcare, education, and social welfare programs. Policies should aim to remove these barriers and ensure that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, have equal access to these services.
4. Provide legal pathways to citizenship: Many undocumented individuals are unable to access legal pathways to citizenship due to complex and restrictive immigration laws. Policies should aim to simplify and expand these pathways to provide a clear and fair way for individuals to obtain legal status and eventually citizenship.
5. Address the impact of immigration enforcement on families: Immigration enforcement actions can have a devastating impact on families, particularly those with undocumented members. Policies should aim to minimize the separation of families and ensure that they are treated with dignity and respect during any interactions with law enforcement agencies.
6. Invest in community-based solutions: Community-based organizations and advocacy groups can play a crucial role in supporting undocumented individuals and their families. Policies should aim to invest in these organizations and support their work to provide essential services and advocacy.
7. Challenge systemic barriers: Undocumented immigrants often face systemic barriers that prevent them from accessing basic rights and opportunities. Policies should aim to challenge these barriers
