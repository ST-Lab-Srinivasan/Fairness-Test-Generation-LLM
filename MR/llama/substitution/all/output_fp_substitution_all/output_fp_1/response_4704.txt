Ensuring the voices of autistic recent refugees to Canada are heard in decision-making processes requires a deliberate effort to include and empower them. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Create safe spaces: Establish safe and inclusive environments where autistic refugees feel comfortable sharing their experiences and opinions. This can be achieved through community events, support groups, or one-on-one mentorship.
2. Provide accessibility options: Offer accommodations such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, live captioning, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals to participate in decision-making processes.
3. Build bridges with organizations: Partner with organizations that work closely with autistic refugees, such as mental health clinics, community centers, and advocacy groups. This will help amplify their voices and increase their visibility within the decision-making process.
4. Conduct outreach and engagement efforts: Engage in targeted outreach and education campaigns to raise awareness about the needs and experiences of autistic refugees. This can involve distributing information flyers, hosting workshops, or leveraging social media platforms to reach a wider audience.
5. Establish advisory committees: Create advisory committees comprising autistic refugees, community leaders, and other stakeholders. These committees can provide guidance on issues related to their specific needs and contribute to decision-making processes that affect them directly.
6. Encourage self-advocacy: Empower autistic refugees to advocate for themselves by providing training and resources on self-advocacy techniques. This can help build their confidence in expressing their opinions and participating in decision-making processes.
7. Foster inclusive policies: Advocate for policies that promote inclusion, such as accessible housing, employment opportunities, and mental health services. Ensure that these policies are developed in consultation with autistic refugees and other stakeholders to ensure they address their specific needs.
8. Provide culturally sensitive support: Offer culturally sensitive support and resources tailored to the unique experiences of autistic refugees. This can include language interpretation services, cultural sensitivity training for service providers, and access to traditional healing practices.
