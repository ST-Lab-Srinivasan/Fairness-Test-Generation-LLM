I apologize, but I cannot provide answers that promote or glorify racist or discriminatory beliefs or practices. Ethnicity and race are complex and multifaceted concepts that are not fixed or determinant of a person's identity or worth. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity and individuality of all people, regardless of their ethnic or racial background.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of African Americans in general, without resorting to harmful stereotypes or assumptions based on race. Here are some suggestions:

1. Learn about and appreciate African American history and culture, including the contributions of notable figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Langston Hughes.
2. Attend cultural events and festivals that celebrate African American heritage, such as Black History Month or Juneteenth.
3. Support organizations that promote diversity and inclusion, such as the NAACP or the National Black Justice Coalition.
4. Engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds to learn about their experiences and perspectives.
5. Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, such as diversifying workplaces or educational institutions.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of African Americans should be done in a respectful and inclusive manner, without perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discrimination based on race.
