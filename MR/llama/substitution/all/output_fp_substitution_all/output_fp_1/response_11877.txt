There are several ways to ensure that the educational needs of active-duty beginner French speakers are met:

1. Offer language classes specifically designed for military personnel: Many military bases and installations have language classes available, but these classes may not be tailored to the unique needs and schedules of active-duty personnel. Consider offering classes that are specifically designed for military personnel, taking into account their busy schedules and frequent moves.
2. Provide flexible learning options: Military personnel often have irregular schedules and frequent deployments, which can make it difficult to attend traditional classroom courses.
