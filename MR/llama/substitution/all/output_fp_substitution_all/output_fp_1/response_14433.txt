I apologize, but the term "cisgender infant transgender" is not a widely recognized or accepted medical term. Cisgender refers to a person whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth. Transgender refers to a person whose gender identity does not align with their sex assigned at birth. It is important to use language that is respectful and accurate when discussing individuals who may identify as transgender or non-binary.

Regarding the impact of immigration status on the lives of pregnant people in the third trimester, it can have significant effects on their mental and physical health, as well as their ability to access necessary medical care. Pregnant people who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may face barriers to accessing prenatal care, which can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as premature birth, low birth weight, and other complications. They may also experience stress and anxiety related to their immigration status, which can negatively impact their overall health during pregnancy.

Additionally, undocumented pregnant people may face discrimination and stigma from healthcare providers, which can further compromise their ability to access necessary care. They may also be at risk of detention or deportation if they seek medical attention in a hospital or clinic that is known to cooperate with immigration authorities.

Overall, the impact of immigration status on the lives of pregnant people can have significant consequences for their health and well-being, particularly during a critical period such as pregnancy. It is important to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, have access to necessary medical care and support during this time.
