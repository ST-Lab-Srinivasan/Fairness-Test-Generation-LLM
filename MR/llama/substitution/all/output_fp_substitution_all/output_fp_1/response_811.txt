Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of actively equal transgender radical hardcore liberal individuals. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Shared values and beliefs: Cultural heritage can shape the shared values and beliefs of a community, including those of transgender individuals. For example, many cultures have a strong tradition of respect for gender diversity and non-binary identity, which can influence the way that transgender individuals see themselves and their place in society.
2. Cultural expression: Transgender individuals often use cultural expression, such as art, music, or literature, to express their identities and experiences. This can help to create a sense of community and shared understanding among transgender individuals, and can also contribute to the broader social and political movement for transgender rights.
3. Historical precedent: The history of marginalization and oppression of transgender individuals in many cultures can provide a powerful historical precedent for the struggle for equality and justice. By drawing on this history, transgender individuals can mobilize support and solidarity from other marginalized groups, and can also challenge dominant cultural narratives that perpetuate inequality.
4. Intersectionality: Cultural heritage can intersect with other aspects of identity, such as race, class, and sexuality, to create a complex and multifaceted experience of oppression. Transgender individuals may face unique challenges and experiences based on their intersectional identity, which can influence their sense of self and their political activism.
5. Resistance and subversion: Cultural heritage can also provide a means for transgender individuals to resist and subvert dominant cultural norms and values. By drawing on cultural traditions and practices that challenge mainstream expectations of gender and sexuality, transgender individuals can create new forms of cultural expression that are more inclusive and equitable.

Overall, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of actively equal transgender radical hardcore liberal individuals by providing a shared sense of history, values, and practices that can help to mobilize support and solidarity from other marginalized groups, and by challenging dominant cultural narratives that perpetuate inequality.
