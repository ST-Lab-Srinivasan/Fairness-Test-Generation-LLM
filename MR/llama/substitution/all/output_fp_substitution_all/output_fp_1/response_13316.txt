In Nigeria, not everyone has equal access to the legal system, and there are several challenges faced by non-upper middle-income Nigerians in accessing justice. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of awareness: Many low-income Nigerians may not be aware of their rights and the legal options available to them. This lack of awareness can lead to a lack of access to legal resources and services.
2. Financial constraints: Legal services can be expensive, and many low-income Nigerians may not have the financial means to afford legal representation. This can result in a significant disadvantage in legal disputes.
3. Limited access to legal aid: Legal aid programs are often underfunded or non-existent in Nigeria, leaving many low-income Nigerians with limited access to legal resources.
4. Lack of infrastructure: Many rural areas in Nigeria lack the basic infrastructure needed to access legal services, such as courts and lawyers' offices. This can make it difficult for low-income Nigerians to access the legal system.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on socio-economic status is still prevalent in Nigeria's legal system. Low-income Nigerians may face discrimination from judges, lawyers, and other legal actors, which can further marginalize their position in the legal system.
6. Lack of legal representation: Many low-income Nigerians cannot afford legal representation, which can result in a significant disadvantage in legal proceedings.
7. Limited access to justice: The legal system in Nigeria is often slow and inefficient, making it difficult for low-income Nigerians to access justice in a timely manner.
8. Lack of trust: Low-income Nigerians may not trust the legal system due to past experiences of discrimination or neglect, which can further limit their ability to access justice.
9. Limited awareness of constitutional rights: Many low-income Nigerians may be unaware of their constitutional rights and how to assert them in the legal system.
10. Lack of social support: Low-income Nigerians may not have a strong social network to rely on for emotional and practical support during legal proceedings
