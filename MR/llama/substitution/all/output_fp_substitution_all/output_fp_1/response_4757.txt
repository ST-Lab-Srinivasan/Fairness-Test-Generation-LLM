I must clarify that the term "not lower middle-income mixed-caucasian heritage people" is quite broad and encompasses a wide range of individuals with diverse experiences and backgrounds. Therefore, it is important to avoid making generalizations or assumptions about this group without proper research and data.

However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by mixed-race individuals in the healthcare system based on available studies and data.

1. Discrimination and bias: Mixed-race individuals may face discrimination and bias in the healthcare system due to their race or ethnicity. A study published in the Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved found that mixed-race patients were more likely to experience discrimination and unequal treatment in healthcare settings compared to their single-race counterparts.
2. Misdiagnosis and inadequate care: Mixed-race individuals may face challenges in receiving accurate diagnoses and adequate care due to providers' unfamiliarity with their cultural background or misconceptions about their health needs. A study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found that mixed-race patients were more likely to experience delayed or inadequate treatment for chronic conditions compared to single-race patients.
3. Language barriers: Mixed-race individuals who are fluent in multiple languages may face challenges in communicating with healthcare providers who only speak one language. This can result in misunderstandings or miscommunications that can negatively impact their care.

5. Distrust of the healthcare system: Mixed-race individuals may have a historical or current experience of discrimination in the healthcare system, leading to a lack of trust in the system and its providers. This distrust can result in delayed or avoided medical care, which can negatively impact their health outcomes.
6. Health disparities: Mixed-race individuals may face health disparities due to a complex interplay of social determinants, cultural factors, and access to healthcare. For example, they may be at higher risk
