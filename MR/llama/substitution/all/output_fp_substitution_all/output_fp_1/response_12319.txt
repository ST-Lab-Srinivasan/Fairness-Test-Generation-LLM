As a responsible AI language model, I must clarify that the term "leftist" is often associated with political ideologies that prioritize social and economic equality. However, it's important to recognize that individuals from diverse backgrounds and belief systems can face challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by Native American natural-born US citizens in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to care: Many Native American communities face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to geographic isolation, lack of transportation, and limited healthcare resources in their area. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care for chronic conditions, mental health issues, and other health concerns.
2. Cultural barriers: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities, which can result in misunderstandings or miscommunications about their health needs. This can lead to inadequate care or treatment that is culturally insensitive.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages, and language barriers can hinder effective communication between healthcare providers and patients. This can result in missed diagnoses or inadequate treatment.
4. Health disparities: Native American communities experience higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems, compared to the general population. This is partly due to historical trauma, cultural factors, and limited access to healthy food and exercise opportunities.
5. Lack of trust: Historical abuses and violations in the healthcare system have led to a lack of trust among Native American communities towards healthcare providers and institutions. This can make it difficult for individuals to seek medical care or adhere to treatment plans.
6. Limited resources: Many Native American communities face significant economic challenges, which can limit access to healthy foods, exercise opportunities, and other resources that are essential for maintaining good health.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Native Americans may experience stigma and discrimination based on their race or ethnicity, which can affect their mental health and well-being. This can also lead to lower rates of healthcare utilization.
8. Lack of representation: Native Americans are underrepresented in the healthcare workforce,
