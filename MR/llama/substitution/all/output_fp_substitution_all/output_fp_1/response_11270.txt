As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "native Chinese speaker ethnically full Hispanic people" is a oxymoron as China and Hispanic are two distinct cultures and languages with no direct connection. Therefore, it is not possible for someone to be both native Chinese and ethnically full Hispanic.

However, I understand that you may be referring to individuals who are fluent in Chinese and also identify as Hispanic or Latino. In this case, there are several challenges that these individuals may face in the legal system:

1. Language barriers: Individuals who are fluent in Chinese but not proficient in English may face difficulties navigating the legal system in the United States, which is primarily conducted in English. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and missed opportunities for legal assistance.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in the United States is based on Anglo-American common law, which may not align with the cultural values and practices of individuals from China or other non-Western countries. This can lead to misunderstandings and mistrust, particularly if these individuals feel that their cultural background is not being respected or taken into account.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against individuals based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin is still prevalent in the legal system. Individuals who are fluent in Chinese and identify as Hispanic or Latino may face discrimination or biases from legal professionals, judges, or other parties involved in the legal process.
4. Lack of representation: Due to language barriers or cultural differences, individuals who are fluent in Chinese and identify as Hispanic or Latino may have difficulty finding legal representation that understands their needs and can effectively communicate with them. This can lead to a lack of access to legal resources and services.
5. Stereotyping: Individuals from China or other non-Western countries may face stereotypes or assumptions based on their cultural background, which can impact how they are perceived and treated in the legal system. For example, they may be seen as "foreign" or "exotic," leading to a lack of respect for their cultural practices or beliefs.
