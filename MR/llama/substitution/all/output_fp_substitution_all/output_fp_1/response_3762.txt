1. Improved communication: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers communicate more effectively with native Spanish speakers who have a military background. Providers can better understand their patients' cultural values, beliefs, and practices, which can lead to more accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans.
2. Building trust: Military culture places a high value on loyalty, discipline, and respect for authority. Healthcare providers who demonstrate cultural competence by showing respect and empathy towards their patients' cultural background can build trust and improve patient satisfaction.

Cultural competence can help healthcare providers develop more effective treatment plans that take into account their patients' cultural beliefs and practices.
