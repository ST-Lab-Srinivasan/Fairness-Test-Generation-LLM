As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that creating inclusive social policies for any group of people, including nominal Christian men, requires careful consideration and respect for the diversity of beliefs, values, and practices within that group. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive social policies for nominal Christian men:

1. Understand the diversity of beliefs and practices within the group: Nominal Christian men come from diverse backgrounds and have different interpretations of their faith. It is essential to understand these differences and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on a single definition of what it means to be a nominal Christian man.
2. Consult with representatives from different Christian denominations: To create inclusive policies, it's important to consult with representatives from different Christian denominations, such as Catholicism, Protestantism, and Orthodox Christianity. This will help ensure that the policies are respectful of the beliefs and practices of all Christians.
3. Consider the needs of marginalized groups within the Christian community: Nominal Christian men are not a homogeneous group, and there may be marginalized subgroups within this group, such as women, LGBTQ+ individuals, or people of color. Policies should prioritize the needs of these groups and work to address the systemic inequalities they face.
4. Foster interfaith dialogue and cooperation: Nominal Christian men are not the only group that can contribute to inclusive social policies. Interfaith dialogue and cooperation with other religious groups can help create more comprehensive and inclusive policies that respect the beliefs and practices of people from different faith traditions.
5. Encourage critical thinking and media literacy: To combat misinformation and disinformation, it's essential to encourage critical thinking and media literacy among nominal Christian men. This can help them better evaluate the information they consume and make informed decisions about their beliefs and practices.
6. Provide opportunities for spiritual growth and development: Nominal Christian men may be interested in exploring their faith and spirituality beyond the basic tenets of their religion. Providing opportunities for spiritual growth and development can help them deepen their understanding of their faith and contribute to a more inclusive and respectful society.
7. Support community service and volunteer work
