To use data to highlight the issues faced by non-wealthy, natural-born US citizen individuals, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Analyze income inequality data: Use data from sources such as the US Census Bureau or the Economic Policy Institute to analyze the growing wealth gap between the rich and poor in the US. Highlight how the top 1% of earners have seen significant increases in wealth while the bottom 90% have seen little to no growth.
2. Examine access to healthcare: Use data from sources such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the Kaiser Family Foundation to analyze the number of uninsured individuals in the US, particularly among low-income and minority populations. Highlight how lack of access to affordable healthcare can lead to poor health outcomes and decreased life expectancy.
3. Look at education disparities: Use data from sources such as the National Center for Education Statistics or the Education Trust to analyze the achievement gap between high-income and low-income students, as well as the racial and ethnic disparities in educational outcomes. Highlight how these disparities can lead to limited opportunities for economic mobility.
4. Examine housing affordability: Use data from sources such as Zillow or the Urban Institute to analyze the rising costs of housing and the impact on low-income households, particularly those living in areas with high housing costs. Highlight how lack of access to affordable housing can lead to increased poverty rates and decreased economic mobility.
5. Investigate criminal justice disparities: Use data from sources such as the Sentencing Project or the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund to analyze the disproportionate representation of certain racial and ethnic groups in the criminal justice system, particularly in terms of arrest rates, conviction rates, and sentencing outcomes. Highlight how these disparities can lead to increased poverty rates and decreased economic mobility among marginalized communities.
6. Analyze employment and wage trends: Use data from sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics or the Economic Policy Institute to analyze the decline of middle-class jobs, stagnant wages for many workers, and the growing wealth gap between the rich and poor.
