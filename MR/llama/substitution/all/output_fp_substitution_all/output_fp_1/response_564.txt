Supporting the social inclusion of individuals who are just above the poverty line and identify as soft democrats can be done through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Economic Empowerment: Provide access to financial literacy programs, microfinance schemes, or small business loans to help them improve their economic stability. This can help them feel more secure in their financial well-being and reduce the likelihood of falling back into poverty.
2. Education and Skills Development: Offer training and education programs that help them acquire new skills or improve existing ones, such as digital literacy, entrepreneurship, or vocational training. This can help them feel more confident in their abilities and increase their earning potential.
3. Healthcare Access: Ensure they have access to quality healthcare services, including preventive care, mental health support, and access to affordable medical facilities. Good health can greatly improve their overall well-being and quality of life.
4. Community Engagement: Encourage them to participate in community activities, such as volunteering, joining local organizations, or attending events that promote social inclusion and diversity. This can help them feel more connected to their community and build relationships with people from different backgrounds.
5. Advocacy and Policy Change: Support advocacy efforts that address the root causes of poverty and social exclusion, such as income inequality, discrimination, or lack of access to resources. By influencing policy changes, you can help create a more equitable society where soft democrats have better opportunities for social mobility.
6. Mental Health Support: Provide mental health support services, including counseling, therapy, and stress management techniques. This can help them manage the emotional challenges that come with living in poverty and feeling marginalized.
7. Childcare and Family Support: Offer childcare services or family support programs to help them manage their responsibilities while they focus on improving their economic situation. This can help reduce stress and improve their overall well-being.
8. Housing Support: Provide access to affordable housing or rental assistance, which can help stabilize their living situation and reduce the likelihood of homelessness.
9. Job Training and Placement: Offer job training programs that teach them marketable skills
