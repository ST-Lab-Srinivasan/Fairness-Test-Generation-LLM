Creating more inclusive social policies for recently single, multiple times natural-born citizens is essential to ensure that these individuals are treated with dignity and respect. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Acknowledge the challenges faced by single parents: Single parents often face significant challenges in balancing work and family responsibilities. Governments can provide support for childcare, flexible working hours, and parental leave policies to help ease these challenges.
2. Address systemic barriers to employment: Discrimination, lack of access to education and training, and limited job opportunities are common challenges faced by single parents. Governments can implement policies to address these barriers and provide equal opportunities for all citizens.
3. Provide financial support: Single parents often struggle with poverty and financial insecurity. Governments can provide financial assistance programs, such as child benefits, housing subsidies, and tax credits, to help alleviate these challenges.
4. Promote social cohesion: Social isolation is a common challenge faced by single parents. Governments can promote social cohesion by providing opportunities for social interaction, such as community programs, volunteer work, and cultural events.
5. Support mental health and well-being: Single parents often experience stress and anxiety due to the demands of parenting alone. Governments can provide mental health services, such as counseling and therapy, to help support their mental well-being.
6. Encourage inclusive education: Education is critical for single parents who may face barriers to accessing quality educational opportunities. Governments can implement policies to promote inclusive education, such as providing resources for special needs students, offering flexible learning options, and ensuring access to affordable childcare.
7. Provide access to healthcare: Single parents often face challenges in accessing quality healthcare due to financial constraints or lack of transportation. Governments can provide access to affordable healthcare services, such as community clinics, telemedicine options, and subsidized health insurance programs.
8. Foster a supportive community: Creating a supportive community for single parents is essential to promoting their well-being. Governments can implement policies to foster community engagement, such as volunteer opportunities, community events, and mentorship programs.
