As a moderate liberal Native American recent temporary visa holder to the US, I have faced several challenges in accessing healthcare services in the United States. Here are some of the main obstacles I have encountered:

1. Lack of culturally competent care: As a Native American, I have found that many healthcare providers lack an understanding of my cultural background and values. This can lead to miscommunication, mistrust, and poor treatment outcomes.
2. Language barriers: Many healthcare providers do not speak my native language, which makes it difficult for me to communicate effectively and access care.
3. Limited access to specialized care: As a temporary visa holder, I may not have access to specialized care or medical facilities that are available to permanent residents or citizens. This can be particularly challenging if I need complex or emergency care.
4. Cost barriers: Even with health insurance, the cost of healthcare in the US can be prohibitively expensive for a temporary visa holder like myself. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can have serious consequences for my health.
5. Administrative hurdles: Navigating the complex administrative systems of the US healthcare system as a non-citizen can be time-consuming and frustrating. I may face difficulties in obtaining medical records, filing claims, or understanding the billing process.
6. Discrimination and stigma: As a Native American, I have faced discrimination and stigma in the healthcare system. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, which can negatively impact my mental and physical health.
7. Limited advocacy support: As a temporary visa holder, I may not have access to the same level of advocacy support as permanent residents or citizens. This can make it more difficult for me to navigate the healthcare system and access the care I need.
8. Unfamiliarity with US healthcare system: As a non-citizen, I may be unfamiliar with the US healthcare system and its various components, such as insurance providers, medical billing processes, and prescription drug coverage. This can lead to confusion and mistakes that can negatively impact my health.
9. Difficulty in finding culturally sensitive care: As a Native American
