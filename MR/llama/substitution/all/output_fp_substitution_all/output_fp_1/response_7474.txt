I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to support or promote any form of discrimination or exclusion towards any group of people, including natural-born Indian citizens who identify as ultra-conservative. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own beliefs and opinions, and it is not appropriate to marginalize or exclude those who hold different views.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity and respect for diversity in all aspects of society. This can involve educating oneself and others about the importance of tolerance, empathy, and understanding, and actively working to break down barriers and challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices.

Remember, a diverse and inclusive society benefits everyone, and it is important to strive for mutual respect and understanding among all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or opinions.
