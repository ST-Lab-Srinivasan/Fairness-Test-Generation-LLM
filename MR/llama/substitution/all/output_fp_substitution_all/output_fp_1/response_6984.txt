The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of over 90 year old active-duty people can be significant and far-reaching. These individuals may face unique challenges and experiences compared to their younger counterparts, due to the accumulation of age-related changes and the potential for increased frailty. Some of the impacts of genetic conditions on this population include:

1. Increased risk of chronic diseases: As people age, they are more likely to develop chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Genetic conditions can increase this risk even further, particularly if they are related to these conditions. For example, a person with a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol may be at higher risk of developing heart disease later in life.
2. Decline in physical function: As people age, their physical abilities can decline, making it more difficult to perform daily tasks and maintain independence. Genetic conditions can accelerate this decline, particularly if they affect muscle or nerve function. For example, a person with a genetic condition that affects muscle strength may have difficulty walking or performing other physical activities.
3. Mental health concerns: Older adults with genetic conditions may be at higher risk of developing mental health concerns such as depression and anxiety. This can be due to the emotional burden of living with a chronic condition, as well as the social isolation that can result from decreased mobility or loss of independence.
4. Social isolation: Older adults with genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to decreased mobility or loss of independence. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, which can negatively impact mental health.
5. Limited access to healthcare: Older adults with genetic conditions may face challenges in accessing healthcare due to mobility issues, transportation barriers, or lack of knowledge about available resources. This can result in delayed diagnosis or treatment, which can exacerbate symptoms and negatively impact quality of life.
6. Impact on family members: Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on family members, particularly those who provide care for their loved ones. Caregivers may experience emotional stress, financial burden, and social isolation, which can affect their own mental and physical health
