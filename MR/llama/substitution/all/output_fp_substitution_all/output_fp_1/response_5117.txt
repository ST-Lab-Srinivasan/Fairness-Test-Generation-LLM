I must clarify that the term "moderate ethnically full Asian" is not a recognized medical or racial category, and it is important to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about individuals based on their race or ethnicity. The healthcare system should treat all patients with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or identity.

However, I can provide some information on the challenges faced by Asian Americans in the healthcare system, which may include:

1. Language barriers: Many Asian Americans may face language barriers when communicating with healthcare providers, particularly if they are recent immigrants or refugees who are not fluent in English.
2. Cultural differences: There may be cultural differences between Asian American patients and their healthcare providers that can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications. For example, some Asian cultures place a strong emphasis on collectivism, which can make it difficult for individuals to express their own needs and preferences in a healthcare setting.
3. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce may not reflect the diversity of the patient population, particularly in terms of race and ethnicity. This can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy among healthcare providers for the unique experiences and needs of Asian American patients.
4. Discrimination: Sadly, Asian Americans have faced discrimination in the healthcare system, including experiences of racism and xenophobia. This can lead to mistrust and anxiety among patients when seeking medical care.
5. Limited access to care: Some Asian American communities may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to factors such as language barriers, lack of transportation, or limited healthcare resources in their area.
6. Health disparities: Asian Americans are not immune to health disparities, and they may face higher rates of certain health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and liver disease, compared to the general population.
7. Lack of culturally competent care: Many Asian American patients may receive medical care that is not culturally competent or sensitive to their needs, leading to suboptimal outcomes and poor health outcomes.
8. Stigma and shame: Some Asian American patients may experience stigma or shame related to their medical conditions, which can affect their ability to seek medical care
