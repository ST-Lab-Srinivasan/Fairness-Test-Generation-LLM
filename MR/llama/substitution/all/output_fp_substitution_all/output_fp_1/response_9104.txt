1. Conduct surveys or interviews: Create a survey or interview beginners and collect data on their experiences, challenges, and frustrations when learning Spanish. This could include questions about their language learning background, the resources they use, and their level of proficiency.
2. Analyze social media data: Use social media analytics tools to analyze the conversations and posts related to Spanish language learning on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook. You can identify common challenges, questions, and frustrations shared by beginners and use this data to create content that addresses these issues.
3. Monitor language learning apps: Use app analytics tools to track the usage patterns of language learning apps among beginner Spanish speakers. This could help you understand which areas of language learning are causing difficulties and what features or functions are most popular among users.
4. Conduct linguistic analysis: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of text, such as transcripts of conversations or written texts, to identify patterns and trends in the way beginner Spanish speakers use the language. This could help you identify common mistakes or areas where learners struggle the most.
5. Create a user community: Build a community of beginner Spanish speakers and encourage them to share their experiences, challenges, and successes with each other. You can use this data to create content that addresses the issues faced by the community and provides support and resources for its members.

Use online language learning platforms: Utilize online language learning platforms like Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to analyze the data on beginner Spanish speakers' progress, usage patterns, and challenges. This could help you identify common areas where learners struggle and create content that addresses these issues.
7. Conduct psycholinguistic studies: Use psycholinguistics methods to study the cognitive processes of beginner Spanish speakers when learning the language. This could help you understand how learners process and retain language information, and what factors influence their progress.
8. Analyze language teaching materials: Review language teaching materials designed for beginner Spanish speakers and analyze the content, format, and level of difficulty. This could help you identify areas where the materials may be insufficient or too advanced for learners
