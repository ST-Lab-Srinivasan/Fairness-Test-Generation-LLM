Documented not single, multiple times (DNM) individuals face unique challenges within the healthcare system. These challenges arise from the complexities of managing their healthcare needs when they have been seen or treated by different providers multiple times. Some of the common challenges faced by DNM individuals include:

1. Lack of Continuity of Care: DNM individuals often experience disruptions in their care due to changes in their health status, insurance coverage, or provider availability. This can result in a lack of continuity in their medical care, leading to missed diagnoses, miscommunication between providers, and delayed treatments.
2. Fragmented Care: DNM individuals often receive fragmented care, as they may see different providers for each specialty or aspect of their health. This can result in a lack of coordination and communication between providers, leading to duplication of services, missed diagnoses, and delayed treatments.
3. Limited Access to Care: DNM individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to factors such as limited insurance coverage, lack of transportation, or cultural or linguistic barriers. This can result in delayed or incomplete care, which can exacerbate their health conditions.
4. Patient Memory and Retention Issues: DNM individuals may experience difficulties in remembering their medical history, medications, and test results due to the multiple times they have been seen by different providers. This can lead to errors in diagnosis and treatment.
5. Provider Fatigue: Providers caring for DNM individuals may experience fatigue and frustration due to the complexity of managing their care. This can result in decreased empathy and communication with the patient, leading to a negative patient experience.
6. Increased Costs: Managing the healthcare needs of DNM individuals can be costly, as they may require more frequent or extensive medical services due to their complex health status.
7. Limited Resources: Healthcare systems may struggle to provide adequate resources for DNM individuals, leading to delays in care, overcrowding in clinics and hospitals, and a lack of specialized services.
8. Stigma and Discrimination: DNM individuals may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers
