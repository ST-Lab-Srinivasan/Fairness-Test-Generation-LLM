As an average earner green card holder, you may face several challenges when navigating the US healthcare system. Here are some of the common obstacles you might encounter:

1. Language barriers: If you don't speak English fluently, you may have difficulty communicating with your healthcare providers, understanding medical instructions, or accessing necessary resources.
2. Lack of insurance coverage: As a green card holder, you may not be eligible for Medicaid or other government-funded health insurance programs. This can make it difficult to afford healthcare services, especially if you have a chronic condition or need ongoing treatment.
3. Limited access to specialists: Depending on where you live and your income level, you may have limited access to specialized medical care. This can be particularly challenging if you have a rare condition that requires specialized treatment.
4. High out-of-pocket costs: Even if you have health insurance, you may still face high out-of-pocket costs for things like copays, deductibles, and coinsurance. This can be particularly challenging if you are living on a fixed income.
5. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The US healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially if you don't have prior experience with it. You may need to spend time and effort figuring out how to access care, find affordable providers, and understand your coverage.
6. Cultural barriers: As a non-US citizen, you may face cultural barriers when accessing healthcare. For example, you may encounter language or cultural differences that can make it difficult to communicate with your providers or follow treatment plans.
7. Discrimination: Unfortunately, some healthcare providers may discriminate against non-US citizens, particularly if they are undocumented. This can lead to delays in care or difficulty accessing necessary services.
8. Difficulty accessing mental health services: Mental health services may not be easily accessible or affordable for average earner green card holders, particularly if you don't have insurance coverage.
9. Limited access to preventive care: As a green card holder, you may have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations.
