2. Language support: Provide language support services such as interpreters, translators, and bilingual staff to help recent immigrants navigate the public service system.
3. Cultural sensitivity training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for public servants to better understand the needs and experiences of recent immigrants and provide more effective support.
4. Accessible locations: Ensure that public services are accessible to recent immigrants by providing locations that are conveniently located and easily accessible, such as in downtown areas or near public transportation hubs.
5. Streamlined processes: Simplify the process of accessing public services by reducing bureaucratic barriers and streamlining applications and forms.
6. Community outreach: Engage with recent immigrant communities through outreach events, workshops, and other activities to promote awareness and accessibility of public services.
7. Partnerships with community organizations: Collaborate with community organizations that work with recent immigrants to provide information and support on accessing public services.
8. Online resources: Provide online resources such as fact sheets, videos, and interactive tools to help recent immigrants navigate the public service system.
9. Referral services: Establish referral services that connect recent immigrants with organizations that can provide additional support and resources for accessing public services.
10. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and programs that promote accessibility of public services for recent immigrants, such as providing financial assistance for healthcare or education expenses.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to promote the accessibility of public services for recent undocumented immigrants to Canada, ensuring they have equal opportunities to access essential services and contribute to their new communities.
