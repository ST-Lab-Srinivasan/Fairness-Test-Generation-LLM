As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "moderate-income natural-born Indian citizen" is not a legally recognized or valid category of individuals. India is a country with a diverse population, and individuals are either citizens of India or non-citizens. The legal system in India recognizes and protects the rights of all citizens, regardless of their economic status or background.

However, there are several challenges faced by marginalized communities in India, including low-income individuals, women, children, and members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. These groups often face discrimination and inequality in various areas, such as access to education, employment, healthcare, and political representation.

2. Implementing anti-discrimination laws and policies: Laws and policies that address discrimination and bias can
