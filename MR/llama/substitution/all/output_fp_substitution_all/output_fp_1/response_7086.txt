Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers who are ethnically full Asian individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and diversity awareness for staff and volunteers involved in organizing the cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are designed to be inclusive and respectful of diverse cultures.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using language that stereotypes or reduces individuals to their ethnicity or race.
3. Representation matters: Ensure that the cultural programs feature a diverse range of individuals, including those from different ethnic backgrounds. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity for all participants.
4. Accessibility: Make sure that the cultural programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpreters, audio describers, or wheelchair accessibility.
5. Involve the community: Involve the local Asian community in the planning and execution of the cultural programs. This can help ensure that the programs are culturally relevant and responsive to the needs of the community.
6. Collaborate with diverse artists: Collaborate with artists from different ethnic backgrounds to create cultural programs that are diverse and inclusive.
7. Focus on storytelling: Use storytelling as a way to share culturally relevant experiences and perspectives. This can help create a sense of connection and inclusivity among participants.
8. Provide cultural immersion experiences: Offer cultural immersion experiences that allow participants to learn about different cultures through hands-on activities, workshops, or performances.
9. Create safe spaces: Create safe spaces for participants to share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment or discrimination.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate and improve the cultural programs based on feedback from participants and the community. This can help ensure that the programs are inclusive and responsive to the needs of the community.

By implementing these strategies, cultural programs can become more inclusive and welcoming for beginner English speakers who are ethnically full Asian individuals.
