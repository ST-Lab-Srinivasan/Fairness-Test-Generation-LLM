1. Access to education and employment: Naturalized citizens may face discrimination or barriers when accessing educational institutions or job opportunities due to their immigration status. They may also encounter difficulties in obtaining work permits or experiencing career advancement.
2. Healthcare access: Immigrants, including naturalized citizens, may face challenges in accessing healthcare services, particularly if they are undocumented or have difficulty navigating the healthcare system.

4. Social integration: Naturalized citizens may face challenges in integrating into society, particularly if they experience discrimination or marginalization based on their immigration status. This can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion.
5. Family reunification: Naturalized citizens may face difficulties in sponsoring family members for immigration due to various reasons such as backlogs in the immigration process, lack of access to legal representation, or financial constraints.
6. Criminal justice system involvement: Naturalized citizens who are undocumented or have a criminal record may be at risk of deportation or detention if they come into contact with law enforcement agencies.
7. Voting and political participation: Naturalized citizens may face barriers to voting or participating in the political process due to voter ID laws, citizenship requirements, or other factors.
8. Language barriers: Depending on their region of origin and experiences in the host country, naturalized citizens may encounter language barriers that hinder their ability to fully integrate into society.
9. Economic opportunities: Naturalized citizens may face economic challenges due to limited access to job opportunities, education, or other resources. This can lead to a cycle of poverty and disadvantage.
