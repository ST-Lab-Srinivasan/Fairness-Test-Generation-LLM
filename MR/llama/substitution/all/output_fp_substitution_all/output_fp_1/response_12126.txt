All individuals, including Native recent green card holders, have the right to access safe and affordable housing. It is important to ensure that these rights are not compromised due to discriminatory practices or policies. Housing providers must comply with federal and state anti-discrimination laws, which prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, and familial status.

To ensure that the housing needs of Native recent green card holders are met, it is important to prioritize inclusive and equitable policies. This can involve:

1. Providing access to affordable and quality housing options, regardless of sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic.
