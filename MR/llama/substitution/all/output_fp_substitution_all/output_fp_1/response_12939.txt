1. Deployment and absenteeism: Military spouses often face the challenge of dealing with deployment and absenteeism, which can lead to emotional stress, financial strain, and social isolation.

4. Financial instability: Military spouses often face financial instability due to the unpredictable nature of military pay and benefits. They may struggle to manage their finances, especially during periods of deployment or when their spouse is transitioning back to civilian life.
5. Social isolation: Military spouses may experience social isolation due to the frequent moves and lack of connections in new locations. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from their social support networks.
