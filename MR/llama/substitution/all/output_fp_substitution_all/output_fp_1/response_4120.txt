Supporting the social inclusion of recent refugees, particularly those from ultra-liberal countries, in India can be challenging due to cultural and language barriers. However, there are several ways to promote their integration and social inclusion:

1. Language classes: Providing language classes specifically tailored for refugees can help them communicate effectively in India. This can be done through partnerships with local organizations or NGOs that offer language training programs.
2. Cultural orientation: Organizing cultural orientation programs can help refugees understand the local customs, laws, and social norms of India. This can include workshops on etiquette, dress codes, and social interactions.
3. Job skills training: Refugees may face challenges finding employment in India due to lack of job skills or experience. Providing job skills training programs can help them acquire the necessary skills to enter the Indian job market.
4. Mentorship programs: Pairing recent refugees with experienced professionals in their field can provide them with valuable guidance and support. This can help them navigate the Indian job market and build professional networks.
5. Community events: Organizing community events that bring together refugees and local communities can promote social interaction and understanding. This can include cultural festivals, sports tournaments, or volunteer opportunities.
6. Access to healthcare: Ensuring that refugees have access to quality healthcare can help address any medical needs they may have. This can be done through partnerships with local hospitals or clinics that offer affordable and accessible healthcare services.
7. Legal support: Providing legal support and advice can help refugees navigate the Indian legal system and address any legal issues they may encounter. This can include assistance with obtaining identity documents, filing for asylum, or accessing other legal resources.
8. Education and training: Offering education and training programs can help recent refugees acquire new skills and knowledge that can help them integrate into the Indian job market. This can include vocational training, language classes, or higher education opportunities.
9. Advocacy and awareness: Raising awareness about the challenges faced by recent refugees in India can help promote their inclusion and acceptance. This can be done through advocacy campaigns, media outreach, or community events that highlight the contributions of refuge
