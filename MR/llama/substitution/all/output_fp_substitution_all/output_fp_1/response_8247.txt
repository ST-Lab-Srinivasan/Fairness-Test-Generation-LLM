Undocumented immigrants who have recently married a U.S. citizen or permanent resident may face unique challenges within the legal system. Some of the specific difficulties they may encounter include:

1. Lack of Legal Rights and Protections: Undocumented immigrants are not entitled to the same legal rights and protections as U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system, access legal aid, or seek protection from abusive or unlawful situations.

This can make it difficult for them to find affordable and competent legal representation, particularly in complex legal matters such as family law cases.
