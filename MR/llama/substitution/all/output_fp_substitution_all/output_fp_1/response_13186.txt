Creating more inclusive cultural programs for Native Arabic speakers who are also African American requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the Community: Consult with members of the Arabic speaking African American community to understand their needs, preferences, and cultural practices. This will help ensure that the programs are culturally sensitive and meaningful to the participants.
2. Provide Language Support: Offer language support services such as translation, interpretation, and bilingual staff to help participants navigate the program. This will help bridge the language gap and ensure that everyone has equal access to information and resources.
3. Incorporate Cultural Elements: Incorporate cultural elements from both Arabic and African American cultures into the programs. This could include music, dance, art, and other forms of expression that are meaningful to both communities.
4. Foster Inclusive Spaces: Create spaces that are inclusive and welcoming for all participants. This could involve creating separate spaces for men and women, as well as providing gender-neutral facilities.
5. Offer Cultural Workshops: Host cultural workshops that focus on the shared history and traditions of both communities. This could include cooking classes, language classes, and other activities that promote cultural exchange and understanding.
6. Engage Community Leaders: Engage community leaders from both cultures to help promote the programs and ensure their success. This could involve partnering with local mosques, churches, and other community organizations.
7. Provide Childcare: Offer childcare services for participants with young children. This will help ensure that parents have access to cultural programming without worrying about finding care for their children.
8. Celebrate Holidays and Traditions: Celebrate holidays and traditions from both cultures to create a sense of shared identity and community. This could involve hosting events such as Eid celebrations, Kwanzaa celebrations, and other cultural gatherings.
9. Offer Education and Resources: Provide education and resources on the history and culture of both communities. This could involve hosting lectures, workshops, and other educational events that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
10. Evaluate and Improve: Continuously evaluate and improve the programs based on feedback
