I cannot provide personalized financial advice or make recommendations based on a person's race or ethnicity. Financial planning should be tailored to an individual's unique circumstances, goals, and risk tolerance, regardless of their age, race, or heritage.

However, here are some general tips that can help ensure the financial needs of someone who has just turned 65 are met:

1. Assess your income and expenses: Determine how much money you have coming in each month from sources such as Social Security, pensions, and investments. Also, make a list of your regular expenses, including housing costs, food, transportation, healthcare, and other necessities.
2. Create a budget: Based on your income and expenses, create a budget that outlines projected income and expenses for each month. Be sure to include a buffer for unexpected expenses or changes in income.
3. Build an emergency fund: Aim to save three to six months' worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account. This will help you cover unexpected expenses, such as medical bills or car repairs, without going into debt.
4. Optimize your Social Security benefits: If you are eligible for Social Security benefits, consider delaying receipt of benefits until later in retirement to maximize your monthly payments. You can use the Social Security Administration's online calculator to estimate your potential benefit amounts.
5. Explore other sources of income: In addition to Social Security and pensions, consider exploring other sources of income, such as part-time work, rental property, or investments.
6. Plan for healthcare expenses: As you age, you may encounter increased healthcare costs. Consider setting aside money each month in a dedicated healthcare savings account to help cover these expenses.
7. Review your investment portfolio: Work with a financial advisor to ensure your investment portfolio is aligned with your risk tolerance and retirement goals. Consider diversifying your portfolio to include a mix of stocks, bonds, and other investments.
8. Estate planning: Make sure you have a comprehensive estate plan in place, including a will, living will, and powers of attorney. This can help ensure that your financial assets are protected
