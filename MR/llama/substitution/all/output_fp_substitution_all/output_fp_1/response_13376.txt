The impacts of immigration status on the lives of poor and moderate people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to basic needs: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers in accessing basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare. They may be reluctant to seek help from government agencies or non-profit organizations due to fear of deportation.
2. Limited job opportunities: Legal and undocumented immigrants may encounter difficulties in finding employment, especially in industries that require special permits or licenses. This can lead to lower earning potential and financial instability.
3. Discrimination and stigma: Immigrants may experience discrimination and stigma based on their immigration status, which can affect their mental health and overall well-being.
4. Uncertainty about the future: Immigrants may live in a state of constant uncertainty due to the possibility of deportation or the lack of a clear pathway to legal residency or citizenship. This can lead to anxiety, stress, and depression.
5. Lack of access to social services: Undocumented immigrants may be ineligible for some government benefits, such as Medicaid or food stamps, due to their immigration status. This can exacerbate existing poverty and limit their ability to access essential resources.
6. Limited access to education: Immigrants may face barriers when trying to access higher education, including language barriers, lack of documentation, and limited financial resources.
7. Lack of political representation: Immigrants may feel disconnected from the political process due to language barriers or fear of deportation. This can limit their ability to advocate for their rights and access political power.
8. Increased vulnerability to exploitation: Immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented, may be more susceptible to workplace exploitation, wage theft, and labor abuse due to a lack of legal protections and fear of reporting abuses.
9. Limited access to healthcare: Immigrants may face difficulties in accessing healthcare services due to language barriers, lack of documentation, or limited financial resources. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences
