Native Arabic speakers who are also freedom advocates may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common difficulties they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: For non-native English speakers, particularly those from the Middle East and North Africa, the language barrier can be a significant challenge in the global job market. Native Arabic speakers may struggle to communicate effectively in English, which can limit their job opportunities.
2. Cultural differences: Freedom advocates may have different cultural backgrounds and values than their Western counterparts. This cultural difference can lead to misunderstandings and communication breakdowns, which can hinder their ability to work effectively in a multicultural environment.
3. Stereotyping and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a lot of stereotyping and discrimination against people from the Middle East and North Africa in the global job market. This can lead to biases and prejudices against native Arabic speakers, making it harder for them to find employment.
4. Limited job opportunities: Freedom advocates may find themselves limited to certain types of jobs due to their cultural or political beliefs. For example, they may be overlooked for leadership positions or other roles that require a high level of trust and confidence from colleagues and clients.
5. Difficulty navigating bureaucracy: In many countries, there are complex bureaucratic systems that can make it challenging for freedom advocates to navigate the job market. This can lead to frustration and disillusionment, particularly if they encounter resistance or obstacles in their efforts to promote social justice and human rights.
6. Isolation and marginalization: Freedom advocates may feel isolated or marginalized within their workplace or industry due to their political beliefs or cultural background. This can lead to feelings of disconnection and alienation, which can negatively impact their mental health and job satisfaction.
7. Lack of representation and role models: The lack of representation and role models in the job market can make it difficult for native Arabic speakers to find mentors or sponsors who understand their cultural background and career aspirations. This can limit their opportunities for advancement and professional growth.
8. Limited access to resources and networks: Freedom advocates may have limited access to resources
