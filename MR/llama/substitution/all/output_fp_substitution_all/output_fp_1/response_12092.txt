As a responsible and caring AI language model, I am pleased to provide suggestions on how to support the social inclusion of older adults in Canada. Here are some ways to promote social inclusion for advanced middle-aged (over 85) natural-born Canadian citizens:

1. Age-Friendly Communities: Support the development of age-friendly communities that are designed to cater to the needs of older adults. This can involve creating safe and accessible public spaces, promoting intergenerational interactions, and providing opportunities for socialization and community engagement.
2. Transportation Options: Ensure that older adults have access to reliable and affordable transportation options, such as public transit or volunteer driver programs, to facilitate their participation in social activities and community events.
3. Healthy Aging Initiatives: Support initiatives that promote healthy aging, such as exercise programs, nutrition workshops, and mental health services. These can help older adults maintain their physical and mental well-being, which is essential for social inclusion.
4. Technology Training: Provide technology training sessions specifically designed for older adults to learn about new technologies that can enhance their quality of life, such as digital communication tools, online resources, and assistive devices.

8. Age-Based Discrimination Education: Offer age-based discrimination education programs to raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity and respect for older adults. This can help challenge ageist attitudes and promote a more inclusive society.
9. Accessible Housing: Adv
