As a neutral AI language model, I must acknowledge that there are several challenges faced by conservative beginner English speakers in the legal system. Here are some of them:

1. Language barriers: For those who are not fluent in English, navigating the legal system can be particularly difficult. They may struggle to understand complex legal terminology, read and write legal documents, or communicate effectively with legal professionals.
