The impact of immigration status on the lives of lower-class democratic libertarian people can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to basic rights and services: Lower-class democratic libertarians may face barriers in accessing basic rights and services such as healthcare, education, and employment due to their immigration status. They may be denied access to these essential services or face discrimination when trying to access them.
