The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of native Arabic speakers who are not liberal, particularly in authoritarian or repressive regimes. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Restrictions on free speech and assembly: In many countries with military status, there are strict limitations on freedom of expression and assembly.
