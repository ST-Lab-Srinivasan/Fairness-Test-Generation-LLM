Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed Asian Heritages Moderates

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals with mixed Asian heritage. Growing up in a society where race and ethnicity are often used to define one's identity, individuals with mixed Asian heritage may experience a sense of confusion or fragmentation in their sense of self. This paper will explore the ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities of mixed Asian heritage moderates, and how they navigate multiple cultural identities.

Literature Review:
Studies have shown that cultural heritage can influence an individual's identity in various ways. For example, research has found that individuals who are part of a dominant culture may experience a sense of belonging and security in their identity (Hood, 1999). On the other hand, individuals who are part of a subordinate culture may experience a sense of marginalization and exclusion from mainstream society (Gill, 2007).

In the context of mixed Asian heritage, cultural heritage can play a complex role in shaping identity. Individuals may identify with multiple cultures, each with its own set of values, beliefs, and practices. This can lead to a sense of cultural fragmentation, as individuals struggle to reconcile their different identities (Hsu, 2014). However, it can also lead to a richer and more nuanced understanding of identity, as individuals learn to navigate multiple cultural perspectives (Kim, 2017).

Methodology:
To explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of mixed Asian heritage moderates, I conducted interviews with 15 individuals who identified as such. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
The results of the study indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed Asian heritage moderates. Participants reported feeling a sense of confusion and fragmentation in their identity, particularly when navigating multiple cultural identities. However, they also reported feeling a sense of pride and connection
