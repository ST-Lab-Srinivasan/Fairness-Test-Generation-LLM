Creating more inclusive recreational activities for refugee high earners can be a great way to help them feel more connected and engaged in their new communities. Here are some ideas:

1. Cultural exchange programs: Organize events that bring together refugees and local high earners to learn about each other's cultures, share experiences, and build relationships. This could include cooking classes, language exchanges, or cultural festivals.
2. Outdoor activities: Refugees may not have access to outdoor spaces or recreational facilities in their new communities. Consider organizing group outings to local parks, hiking trails, or beaches, where they can relax and enjoy nature.
