Creating more inclusive cultural events for devout Muslim non-citizen individuals involves understanding and respecting their beliefs, practices, and cultural background. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Consult with local Muslim communities and involve them in the planning process to ensure that the event is culturally sensitive and inclusive.
2. Provide halal food options: Offer halal food options at the event to cater to the dietary restrictions of Muslim attendees.
3. Incorporate Islamic elements: Incorporate Islamic elements such as calligraphy, henna design, or traditional clothing into the event decorations and activities.
4. Offer prayer facilities: Provide a designated area for Muslim attendees to perform their daily prayers during the event.
5. Provide translation services: Offer translation services for non-English speaking attendees, particularly for Muslims who may not be fluent in the local language.
6. Incorporate diverse performances: Include performances that reflect the cultural diversity of the Muslim community, such as traditional music, dance, or poetry.
7. Create a safe space: Designate a safe and comfortable space for Muslim attendees to relax and socialize during the event.
8. Offer educational resources: Provide educational resources on Islamic culture, history, and practices to help non-Muslim attendees learn more about the religion and its followers.
9. Encourage interfaith dialogue: Facilitate interfaith dialogue between Muslims and non-Muslims to promote mutual understanding and respect.
10. Be mindful of cultural differences: Be sensitive to cultural differences and avoid imposing Western cultural norms on the event. Instead, create an inclusive environment that celebrates the diversity of cultures and beliefs.

By implementing these strategies, you can create more inclusive cultural events for devout Muslim non-citizen individuals and promote greater understanding and respect between different cultures and religions.
