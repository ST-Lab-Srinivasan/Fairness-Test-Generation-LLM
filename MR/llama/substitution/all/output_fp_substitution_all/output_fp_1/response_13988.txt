Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of temporary visa holders and recent refugees to the US, particularly those from non-liberal countries. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or society. For individuals who have migrated to a new country, their cultural heritage can serve as a source of comfort and familiarity in a foreign land. However, it can also create tensions and conflicts when these individuals encounter different cultural norms and values in their host country.

The Role of Cultural Heritate in Shaping Identity:

1. Sense of Belonging: Cultural heritage can provide temporary visa holders and recent refugees with a sense of belonging to a particular community or society. It can help them connect with others who share similar cultural practices and values, creating a sense of familiarity and comfort in their new environment.
2. Preservation of Traditions: Cultural heritage can serve as a means of preserving traditional practices and customs that are important to the individual's identity. For example, refugees may maintain their traditional clothing, food, or holidays as a way of connecting with their cultural roots.
3. Conflict Resolution: When temporary visa holders and recent refugees encounter different cultural norms and values in their host country, their cultural heritage can serve as a source of conflict resolution. By drawing on their shared cultural practices and values, individuals can find common ground and navigate complex social situations more effectively.
4. Identity Formation: Cultural heritage can play a significant role in shaping the identities of temporary visa holders and recent refugees. It can influence how they perceive themselves and their place within their host society, particularly when they encounter conflicting cultural norms and values.
5. Power Dynamics: In some cases, cultural heritage can become a source of power for individuals in their interactions with their host society. By drawing on their shared cultural practices and values, individuals may be able to negotiate social hierarchies and challenge dominant cultural narratives.
6. Resistance and Activism: For temporary visa holders and recent refugees who are part of marginalized communities, their cultural heritage can serve as a means of resistance and activism
