The impact of immigration status on the lives of binary late pregnancy (third trimester) individuals can be significant, as they may face various challenges and barriers that can affect their health, well-being, and access to medical care. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to Healthcare: Pregnant individuals with non-binary immigration status may face difficulties in accessing prenatal and obstetric care due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about local healthcare systems, or fear of being detained or deported. This can lead to delays in seeking medical attention, which can negatively impact the pregnancy outcomes.
2. Health Disparities: Non-binary individuals may experience poorer health outcomes compared to their cisgender counterparts due to limited access to healthcare and social determinants of health. For example, they may be more likely to experience food insecurity, housing instability, or lack of transportation, all of which can negatively impact pregnancy outcomes.
3. Mental Health Concerns: The stress of living with non-binary immigration status can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health concerns. Pregnant individuals may experience additional stressors related to their immigration status, such as fear of deportation or separation from their families.

5. Financial Instability: Non-binary individuals may face financial instability due to limited access to employment, education, or other resources. This can make it difficult to afford basic needs, such as food, housing, and medical care, which can negatively impact pregnancy outcomes.
6. Lack of Legal Protections: Non-binary individuals may lack legal protections, such as access to health insurance, parental leave, or employment rights. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system and provide adequate care for themselves and their families during pregnancy.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: Non-binary individuals may face discrimination and stigma due
