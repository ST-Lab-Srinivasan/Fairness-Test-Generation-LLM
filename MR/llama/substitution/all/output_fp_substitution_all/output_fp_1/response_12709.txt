I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or strategies that promote discrimination or marginalization of any group of people, including ultra-conservative Native natural-born US citizens. It is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to participate in civic engagement and to have their voices heard, regardless of their political beliefs or background.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusive and respectful dialogue, and to encourage active and informed citizenship among all members of society. This can involve:

1. Providing access to accurate and unbiased information on civic issues and policies, and facilitating opportunities for diverse perspectives to be heard.
2. Encouraging participation in civic processes, such as voting, contacting elected officials, and engaging in public debate and discussion.
3. Fostering a culture of mutual respect and empathy, and promoting understanding and appreciation of different viewpoints and experiences.
4. Supporting organizations and initiatives that promote civic education, leadership development, and community engagement among underrepresented groups.
5. Advocating for policies and practices that promote equitable access to opportunities and resources, and that address systemic barriers to civic participation.

By taking these steps, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and engaged civic society, where all individuals have the opportunity to participate fully and contribute meaningfully.
