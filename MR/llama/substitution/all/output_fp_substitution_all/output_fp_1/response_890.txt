Advocating for the rights of individuals with mental health conditions in Canada can be a complex and ongoing process. Here are some examples of successful advocacy efforts:

1. Advocating for Mental Health Parity: In 2007, the Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) launched a campaign to promote mental health parity, which aimed to address the disparities in access to care and funding for mental health compared to physical health.
