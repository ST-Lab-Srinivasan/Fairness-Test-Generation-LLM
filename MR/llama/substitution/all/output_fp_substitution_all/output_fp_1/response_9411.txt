In a pluralistic society where individuals hold diverse beliefs and values, it is essential to ensure that the legal rights of non-libertarian nominal Christians are protected. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Constitutional protection: Ensure that the constitution provides for the rights of all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof. This could include provisions for freedom of religion, freedom from discrimination, and protection against unequal treatment under the law.
2. Anti-discrimination laws: Enact laws that prohibit discrimination based on religion, race, gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic. This can help protect non-libertarian nominal Christians from being treated unfairly in various areas of life, such as employment, education, and public accommodations.
3. Religious freedom protections: Provide safeguards for the free exercise of religion, including the right to observe one's own religious practices and beliefs without interference or persecution. This could involve protecting individuals from being compelled to participate in religious activities against their will or from facing punishment or discrimination for observing their faith.
4. Education reform: Work towards creating a more inclusive and respectful educational environment, where all students can learn without fear of persecution or discrimination based on their religion. This could involve implementing anti-bulllying policies, promoting diversity and inclusion in the curriculum, and providing support for students who may be facing discrimination or bullying because of their religious beliefs.
5. Social welfare policies: Develop social welfare programs that are inclusive and respectful of all religions. This could involve providing financial assistance to individuals and families in need, regardless of their religious affiliation. Additionally, work towards creating a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities within society, so that no individual or group is disadvantaged because of their religion.
6. Encouraging dialogue and understanding: Facilitate interfaith dialogue and understanding between individuals of different religious backgrounds. This could involve organizing events and workshops where people can come together to learn about each other's beliefs and practices, and build bridges of mutual respect and understanding.
7. Providing legal support: Establish legal aid clinics
