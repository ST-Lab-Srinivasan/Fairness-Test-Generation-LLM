I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their sexual orientation or political views. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their identity or beliefs. It is important to recognize that discrimination and prejudice against marginalized groups, including those who identify as LGBTQ+ or hold extreme political views, is not acceptable and can have serious consequences.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs. This can involve educating oneself about the experiences and challenges faced by marginalized communities, advocating for policies and practices that promote equality and inclusion, and engaging in respectful and open-minded dialogue with those who hold different views.

Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, and it is important to strive for a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity for all individuals.
