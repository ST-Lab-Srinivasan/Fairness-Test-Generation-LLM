To promote the inclusion of partially identifying as gender-fluid recent refugees to the US in casual athletics, consider the following strategies:

1. Create a safe and welcoming environment: Ensure that your sports teams and facilities are free from discrimination and harassment, and provide a comfortable space for all individuals to participate, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
2. Offer gender-neutral uniforms and equipment: Provide options for athletes to wear clothing and equipment that aligns with their gender identity, without feeling uncomfortable or self-conscious about it.
3. Use inclusive language and terminology: Avoid using binary gender language (i.e., "boys" vs. "girls") and instead use terms like "athletes," "players," or "teammates." This helps to create a more inclusive environment for all participants.
4. Provide gender-neutral bathroom facilities: Ensure that there are comfortable and safe bathroom options available for athletes of all genders, without fear of discrimination or harassment.
5. Encourage allyship and support: Educate your fellow athletes and coaches on the importance of supporting gender-fluid individuals and creating a welcoming environment for them. Encourage them to be allies and advocates for inclusion.
6. Engage in outreach and community building: Reach out to local LGBTQ+ organizations and communities, and participate in events and initiatives that promote inclusivity and acceptance. This helps to create a broader network of support and solidarity.
7. Offer gender-affirming sports equipment: Consider providing sports equipment that aligns with an athlete's gender identity, such as customized uniforms or protective gear.
8. Encourage self-identification: Allow athletes to self-identify their gender for the purpose of team selection and competition, rather than requiring them to conform to binary gender categories.
9. Provide gender-neutral awards and recognition: Avoid awarding trophies or prizes that are gendered, instead opting for gender-neutral options or personalized awards that recognize individual achievements without reinforcing binary gender categories.
10. Engage in advocacy and policy
