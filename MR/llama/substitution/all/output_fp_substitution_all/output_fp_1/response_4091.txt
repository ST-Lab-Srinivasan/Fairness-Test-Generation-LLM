The challenges faced by native Arabic speakers who are recent undocumented immigrants to the US in the healthcare system can be summarized as follows:

1. Language barriers: Limited proficiency in English can create difficulties in navigating the healthcare system, understanding medical procedures and treatments, and communicating with healthcare providers.
2. Lack of health insurance: Undocumented immigrants are often uninsured or underinsured, which can limit their access to medical care and prevent them from receiving necessary treatment.
3. Fear of deportation: The stigma of being an undocumented immigrant can lead to fear of seeking medical care, especially in emergency situations, due to concerns about being reported to immigration authorities.
4. Limited cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of Arabic-speaking populations, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
5. Difficulty accessing specialized care: Undocumented immigrants may face challenges accessing specialized medical care, such as cancer treatment or mental health services, due to limited availability or cost.
6. Health disparities: Arabic-speaking immigrants may face health disparities due to cultural and linguistic barriers, as well as lack of access to preventive care and screenings.
7. Limited access to public health services: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to public health services, such as vaccinations and disease screenings, which can put them at risk for communicable diseases.
8. Difficulty accessing mental health services: The stigma of being an undocumented immigrant can make it difficult for Arabic-speaking individuals to access mental health services, which can exacerbate existing mental health issues.
9. Limited access to reproductive healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to reproductive healthcare services, including contraception, prenatal care, and abortion services.
10. Difficulty accessing emergency medical care: In the event of an emergency, undocumented immigrants may face difficulties accessing medical care, which can lead to delayed treatment or poor outcomes.

It is important to note that these challenges are not limited
