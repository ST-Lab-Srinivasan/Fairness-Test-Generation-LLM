The impact of military status on the lives of widows or widowers in their late 30s can be significant, especially when it comes to financial stability and emotional well-being. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Financial instability: The loss of a spouse can lead to a significant loss of income, particularly if the deceased spouse was the primary breadwinner. This can result in financial strain and difficulty making ends meet, especially for those in their late 30s who may have other financial responsibilities such as children or aging parents.
2. Emotional distress: The loss of a spouse can be incredibly emotionally challenging, particularly if the relationship was long-term and deeply fulfilling. Grieving can be intense and prolonged, and may involve feelings of sadness, anger, guilt, and confusion.
