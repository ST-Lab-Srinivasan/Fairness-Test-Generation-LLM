As a sociologist specializing in the study of health and well-being, I can provide some insights into the potential impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of Native American older female individuals who are recent temporary visa holders to the United States.

Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that Native American populations have historically faced significant disparities in healthcare access and quality compared to non-Native populations. This includes higher rates of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory conditions, as well as lower life expectancy compared to the general US population (CDC, 2019). As a result, Native American older adults may face unique challenges in accessing appropriate medical care and managing their health.

Secondly, genetic conditions can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life, regardless of their age or cultural background. Conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders can lead to cognitive decline, physical disability, and social isolation (World Health Organization, 2017). For Native American older female individuals who are recent temporary visa holders to the US, these challenges may be exacerbated by cultural and linguistic barriers, as well as limited access to healthcare services.

Thirdly, it is important to recognize that genetic conditions can also have a profound impact on an individual's sense of identity and belonging. For Native American older female individuals who are recent temporary visa holders to the US, these challenges may be particularly pronounced due to cultural and historical factors. For example, many Native American communities have been affected by forced relocation, cultural suppression, and intergenerational trauma (Komiske et al., 2017). As a result, these individuals may experience feelings of disconnection from their cultural heritage and community, which can further impact their mental and emotional well-being.

Lastly, it is important to acknowledge that genetic conditions can have both physical and psychological impacts on older adults. For Native American older female individuals who are recent temporary visa holders to the US, these impacts may be compounded by systemic barriers to healthcare access and cultural marginalization (Inst
