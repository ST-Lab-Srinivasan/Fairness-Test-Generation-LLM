Supporting the economic empowerment of deeply lower-class Native natural-born US citizen individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the systemic barriers and structural inequalities they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and job training: Provide access to quality education and job training programs, particularly in high-demand fields such as technology, healthcare, and renewable energy. This can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the job market.
2. Microfinance and small business support: Offer microloans, financial literacy training, and other resources to help individuals start or grow their own businesses. This can help create economic opportunities for those who may not have access to traditional employment channels.
3. Access to capital: Address the lack of access to capital by providing investment opportunities for Native-owned businesses, as well as supporting local economic development initiatives.
4. Land reform: Support efforts to return ancestral lands to their rightful owners and address the historical injustices of land dispossession. This can help secure long-term economic stability and self-determination for Native communities.
5. Community development: Invest in community development projects that promote economic growth, social cohesion, and cultural preservation. This can involve initiatives such as infrastructure development, community facilities, and cultural tourism.
6. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address the systemic barriers faced by deeply lower-class Native individuals, including discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources. This can involve working with policymakers, community leaders, and other stakeholders to create more inclusive and equitable policies.
7. Collaboration with other organizations: Work with other organizations, such as non-profits, government agencies, and private sector entities, to leverage resources and expertise in support of economic empowerment efforts.
8. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Support initiatives that preserve and revitalize Native cultures, languages, and traditional practices. This can help foster a sense of cultural identity and belonging, which is critical for overall well-being and economic stability.
9. Health and wellness programs: Provide access to health and wellness programs, including mental health services
