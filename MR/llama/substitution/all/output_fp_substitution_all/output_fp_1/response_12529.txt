Ensuring the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are not recently widowed, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Design spaces where all participants feel comfortable and included. This can be done by providing interpretation or translation services, using visual aids, and encouraging active listening.
2. Use participatory methods: Incorporate participatory methods, such as group discussions, role-playing, and problem-solving exercises, to involve all participants in the decision-making process.
3. Build relationships: Take the time to build relationships with beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are not recently widowed, by engaging them in informal conversations and activities outside of decision-making sessions.
4. Provide language support: Offer language support, such as one-on-one tutoring or language classes, to help beginner Arabic speakers improve their language skills and participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
5. Use technology: Leverage technology, such as translation apps or online platforms, to enable greater participation from beginner Arabic speakers who may not be fluent in the local language.
6. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion and respect for diversity within the decision-making process. This can help to create an environment where beginner Arabic speakers feel comfortable participating and their voices are heard.
7. Establish clear communication channels: Set up clear communication channels that enable beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are not recently widowed, to provide input and feedback throughout the decision-making process.
8. Provide guidance and support: Offer guidance and support to beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are not recently widowed, to help them navigate the decision-making process and have their voices heard.
9. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids, such as pictures or diagrams, to help beginner Arabic speakers understand complex concepts and participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
10. Encourage active listening: Encourage all participants, including beginner Arabic speakers, to actively listen to each other and build upon each other's ideas to ensure that all voices are heard and valued.
