Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have far-reaching consequences for an individual's personal, social, and economic well-being. While the traditional narrative suggests that marriage is the key to happiness and fulfillment, recent research has challenged this view, highlighting the complexities of marital status on individuals' lives. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of non-newly single individuals, examining how their marital status affects their mental health, social relationships, and economic stability.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can have a profound impact on an individual's life, regardless of whether they are newly single or not. For instance, research has found that married individuals tend to have better mental health outcomes compared to their unmarried counterparts (Tucker et al., 2016). This may be due to the social support and stability that marriage provides, as well as the potential for increased access to resources such as healthcare and financial security.

However, being in a non-traditional marital status, such as cohabiting or being in an open relationship, can also have positive impacts on mental health (Kirchner & Karney, 2017). These arrangements often involve more egalitarian power dynamics and greater communication and mutual support, which can lead to improved well-being.

In terms of social relationships, marital status can also have a significant impact on an individual's social network (DiDonato et al., 2014). Married individuals tend to have larger and more diverse social networks compared to unmarried individuals, which may provide additional emotional support and resources.

Economically, marital status can affect an individual's access to resources such as health insurance, retirement benefits, and wealth accumulation (Liu & Li, 2014). Married individuals tend to have higher levels of economic stability compared to unmarried individuals, particularly if they are in a long-term marriage.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. The sample will consist of 500 non-newly single individuals aged 18-65 years old, recruited
