Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of native English speakers who are over 90 years old, particularly for those who are over 85. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Social isolation: Older individuals with strong political beliefs may find themselves isolated from their peers and communities due to disagreements on political issues. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection, which can negatively impact mental and physical health.
2. Healthcare access: Depending on the political climate, older individuals may face challenges in accessing healthcare services. For example, if a particular political party is opposed to universal healthcare, older individuals who rely on this service may find themselves without adequate coverage.
3. Economic security: Political affiliation can also impact an individual's economic security, particularly for those who are reliant on government benefits. Changes in tax policies, social security, and other economic measures can significantly affect the financial well-being of older individuals.
4. Voting rights: The political affiliation of older individuals may impact their ability to exercise their right to vote. Changes in voting laws or restrictions on voting rights can disproportionately affect older individuals who may face barriers to voting, such as voter ID laws or limits on early voting.
5. Intergenerational relationships: Older individuals with strong political beliefs may struggle to connect with younger generations, particularly if they feel that their views are not being heard or respected. This can lead to feelings of disconnection and isolation within families and communities.
6. Mental health: The stress of living in a politically polarized environment can have a significant impact on the mental health of older individuals. Chronic stress can exacerbate existing mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety, and may also contribute to the development of these conditions in those who are not previously affected.
7. Community engagement: Older individuals with strong political beliefs may find themselves at odds with their communities, particularly if they feel that their views are not being represented. This can lead to a decrease in community engagement and social participation, which can have negative impacts on mental and physical health.
8. Identity formation: Political affiliation can play a significant role in shaping an individual's identity, particularly for those who are over 9
