Celebrating the diversity of recently early pregnant active-duty individuals can be challenging, especially during the first trimester when symptoms like nausea and fatigue may make it difficult to participate in activities. However, here are some ways to acknowledge and support these individuals:

1. Check-ins and virtual events: Organize virtual check-ins or events where pregnant military personnel can connect with each other and share their experiences. This can be done through video conferencing or online forums.
2. Virtual fitness classes: Offer virtual fitness classes that cater to the needs of pregnant individuals, such as prenatal yoga or Pilates. This way, they can still exercise while prioritizing their health and safety.
3. Pregnancy support groups: Create or join existing support groups for pregnant military personnel. These groups can provide a safe space for individuals to share their experiences, ask questions, and receive emotional support from peers and mental health professionals.
4. Care packages: Organize care package drives for pregnant active-duty personnel, filled with items that may help ease symptoms such as nausea or fatigue. This can be a thoughtful way to show appreciation and support during this time.
5. Flexible work arrangements: Offer flexible work arrangements, such as telework or modified duty, to accommodate the needs of pregnant military personnel. This can help them continue serving while also prioritizing their health and well-being.
6. Baby shower celebrations: Organize a baby shower for the expecting parent(s), either virtually or in-person, depending on the preferences of the individual. This can be a fun way to celebrate the upcoming arrival of the new baby while also acknowledging the challenges of early pregnancy.
7. Military spouse and family events: Host events specifically for military spouses and families, including pregnant individuals. These events can provide opportunities for socializing, networking, and accessing resources and support.
8. Health and wellness resources: Offer health and wellness resources, such as nutrition counseling or mental health services, specifically designed for pregnant military personnel. This can help them prioritize their health during this critical time.
