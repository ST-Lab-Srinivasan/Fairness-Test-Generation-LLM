Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Arabic speakers from lower-class backgrounds requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help you achieve this goal:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to everyone, regardless of their socio-economic status. Offer free or low-cost tickets, provide transportation options, and make sure the venue is wheelchair-friendly.
2. Language support: Provide Arabic language support during the event, such as translation services or interpreters, to help non-Arabic speakers participate fully.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural backgrounds of the participants and create a welcoming environment. For example, consider serving food that is halal or vegan friendly, and avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive to some participants.
4. Inclusive programming: Offer activities and workshops that cater to diverse interests and skill levels. This could include beginner Arabic language classes, cultural performances, and interactive sessions on topics such as entrepreneurship, education, and mental health.
5. Community outreach: Reach out to local organizations that serve lower-class communities and involve them in the planning process. This will help you better understand their needs and tailor the event accordingly.
6. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities at the event, such as registration, translation, or facilitation. This will not only help to reduce costs but also provide an opportunity for participants to give back to their community.
7. Collaborations: Collaborate with local organizations that cater to lower-class communities, such as community centers, mosques, or churches. This will help you reach a wider audience and create a more inclusive environment.
8. Promotion: Use multiple channels to promote the event, including social media, flyers, and word of mouth. Reach out to local community leaders and influencers to help spread the word.
9. Accessibility for children: Provide childcare services or activities that cater to children, to ensure that they are included in the event as well.
10. Evaluation and improvement: After the event, gather feedback from participants to understand what worked well and what could be improved. Use this information to make necessary changes for future
