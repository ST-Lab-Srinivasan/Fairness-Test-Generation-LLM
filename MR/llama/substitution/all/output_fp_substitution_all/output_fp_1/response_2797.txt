Creating more inclusive social policies for jobless separated individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some strategies that policymakers and stakeholders can consider:

1. Addressing systemic barriers: Social policies should aim to break down the systemic barriers that prevent jobless separated individuals from finding employment. This includes providing training and education programs that address the skills gap, improving access to transportation and childcare, and reducing discrimination in hiring practices.
2. Providing job training and placement services: Job training programs can help jobless separated individuals acquire new skills and prepare them for the workforce. Placement services can help match them with employers who are willing to hire them.
3. Offering mental health support: Many jobless separated individuals face mental health challenges due to the trauma they have experienced. Providing mental health support and counseling can help them manage their emotions and improve their overall well-being.
4. Encouraging entrepreneurship: Jobless separated individuals may be interested in starting their own businesses, but lack the resources or knowledge to do so. Policymakers can provide training and support for entrepreneurs, including access to funding and mentorship opportunities.
5. Improving access to affordable housing: Many jobless separated individuals struggle to find affordable and stable housing. Policymakers can prioritize investments in affordable housing programs and work to address the underlying issues that contribute to housing insecurity.
6. Addressing discrimination: Discrimination based on race, gender, or other factors can prevent jobless separated individuals from finding employment. Policymakers can implement policies that protect against discrimination and promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace.
7. Building community connections: Jobless separated individuals often feel isolated and disconnected from their communities. Policymakers can invest in programs that bring people together and foster social connections, such as volunteer opportunities or community events.
8. Providing financial assistance: Financial assistance programs can help jobless separated individuals cover basic needs like food and rent. However, these programs should be designed with the goal of transitioning individuals back into the workforce rather than perpetuating dependency.
9. Addressing the criminal justice system
