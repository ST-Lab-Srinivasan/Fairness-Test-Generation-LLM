Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for Native American natural-born US citizens who identify as strong atheists can be achieved by incorporating diverse perspectives and respecting the beliefs of all individuals involved. Here are some suggestions:

1. Consult with community members: Reach out to Native American communities and consult with elders, leaders, and other community members to ensure that the celebration is inclusive and respectful of their beliefs.
2. Avoid religious imagery: While many Native American cultures have traditional spiritual practices, it's important to avoid incorporating religious imagery or language that may be offensive or alienating to non-religious individuals. Instead, focus on cultural and historical aspects of the community.
3. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Involve a variety of voices and perspectives in the planning and execution of the celebration, including those of strong atheists, as well as others who may have different beliefs or backgrounds. This can help create a more inclusive and respectful atmosphere.
4. Highlight cultural and historical aspects: Celebrate the cultural and historical aspects of Native American communities, such as traditional music, dance, art, and food. This can help create a sense of shared identity and pride without relying on religious language or imagery.
5. Provide alternative ways to participate: Offer alternative ways for individuals who may not identify with religious practices to participate in the celebration. For example, they could participate in cultural activities or contribute to the planning process in other ways.
6. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use language and terminology that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals involved. Avoid using language that may be offensive or alienating to non-religious individuals.
7. Foster a sense of community: Encourage a sense of community and mutual respect among all participants, regardless of their beliefs. This can help create a more inclusive and welcoming atmosphere for everyone involved.
