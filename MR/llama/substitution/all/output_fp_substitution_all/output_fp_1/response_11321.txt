Creating more inclusive community events for wheelchair-using people who are just above the poverty line requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible to people with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs. This may involve providing wheelchair ramps, elevators, or other accessibility features.
2. Inclusive marketing: Use language and imagery in promotional materials that are inclusive of people with disabilities. Avoid using language that perpetuates stereotypes or stigmatizes disability.
3. Accommodations: Offer accommodations such as sign language interpreters, audio describers, or braille materials for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision.
4. Affordable tickets: Make sure that the event tickets are affordable and accessible to people who are on a limited income, such as those who are just above the poverty line. Consider offering sliding scale ticket prices or scholarships for attendees who cannot afford the full price.
5. Accessible programming: Plan events that are inclusive of people with disabilities and tailored to their interests and needs. For example, include wheelchair-accessible activities, such as adaptive sports or art classes.
6. Partnership with disability organizations: Collaborate with local disability organizations to help promote the event and ensure that it is accessible to people with disabilities.
7. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities for people with disabilities, such as serving as event staff or helping with accessibility-related tasks. This can help build a sense of community and inclusion.
8. Education and training: Provide education and training for event staff and volunteers on how to best support people with disabilities, including those who use wheelchairs.
9. Feedback mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism for attendees to provide input on the accessibility of the event and suggest improvements for future events.
10. Continuous improvement: Regularly review and evaluate the accessibility of the event, and make changes as needed to ensure that it is inclusive and accessible to all.

By following these steps, you can create a more inclusive community
