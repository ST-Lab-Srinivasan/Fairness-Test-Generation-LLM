Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for over 90-year-old French speakers requires a thoughtful and respectful approach that takes into account their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite older French speakers to participate in the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that their preferences and traditions are taken into account and that they feel valued and included.
2. Provide accessible venues and transportation: Make sure that the venues for cultural celebrations are wheelchair accessible and have easy parking and transportation options. This can help ensure that older French speakers can participate comfortably and easily.
3. Offer age-appropriate activities: Plan cultural celebrations that cater to the interests and abilities of older French speakers. For example, you could offer cultural events that are more low-key and less physically demanding, such as concerts or lectures.
4. Provide language support: Offer language interpretation services during cultural celebrations to help older French speakers who may not speak fluent French. This can help ensure that they are able to fully participate and enjoy the events.
5. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage younger and older French speakers to connect and learn from each other. This can help build bridges between generations and create a more inclusive and connected community.
6. Celebrate their cultural heritage: Honor and celebrate the cultural heritage of older French speakers by incorporating elements of their culture into cultural celebrations. For example, you could include traditional music or dance from their region, or serve foods that are meaningful to them.
7. Create a sense of community: Plan cultural celebrations that foster a sense of community and belonging among older French speakers. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for everyone involved.
8. Offer opportunities for socialization: Provide opportunities for older French speakers to connect with each other and with the wider community through cultural celebrations. This can help combat isolation and loneliness, which are common issues among older adults.
9. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be respectful of the cultural practices and beliefs of older French speakers
