Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are African American individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on Middle Eastern and North African cultures, history, and customs for your staff and volunteers. This will help them understand the cultural nuances and be more sensitive to the needs of the participants.
2. Inclusive Programming: Offer a variety of programs that cater to different interests and preferences of the participants. For example, you could offer classes on Arabic language, culture, music, art, and food. Make sure that the programs are accessible and inclusive for all participants.
3. Safe Space: Create a safe space for participants to share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment or discrimination. Encourage open communication and active listening to ensure that everyone feels heard and valued.
4. Intersectionality: Acknowledge the intersectionality of identities and experiences of your participants. Be mindful of the multiple identities and experiences that they bring to the table, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, and ability.
5. Community Building: Foster a sense of community among participants by creating opportunities for them to connect with each other and build relationships. This could be through social events, group projects, or peer-to-peer mentorship programs.
6. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms that allow participants to provide input on the programs and suggest improvements. This will help you understand their needs and preferences better and make necessary adjustments to create a more inclusive environment.
7. Celebration of Diversity: Celebrate the diversity of cultures, languages, and experiences of your participants. Highlight the unique aspects of each culture and encourage participants to share their perspectives and traditions.
8. Collaborations: Collaborate with other organizations and communities to create more inclusive cultural programs. This could involve partnering with Arabic language schools, mosques, community centers, or other cultural organizations.
9. Accessibility: Ensure that your programs are accessible to participants with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for visual content.
