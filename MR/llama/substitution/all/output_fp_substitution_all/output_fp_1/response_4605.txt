Title: Impacts of Genetic Conditions on Older Adult Ex-Military People: A Review

Abstract:
Older adult ex-military people with genetic conditions face unique challenges that can affect their physical, mental, and social well-being. This review aims to provide an overview of the impacts of genetic conditions on older adult ex-military people, including the prevalence, diagnosis, treatment options, and support services available. We also discuss the potential psychological and social effects of living with a genetic condition in this population. Findings suggest that older adult ex-military people with genetic conditions experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality compared to their peers without these conditions. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can improve outcomes, but access to healthcare services may be limited due to factors such as ageism, stigma, and financial constraints. Support from mental health professionals and social networks is crucial for managing the emotional and psychological impacts of living with a genetic condition in this population.
