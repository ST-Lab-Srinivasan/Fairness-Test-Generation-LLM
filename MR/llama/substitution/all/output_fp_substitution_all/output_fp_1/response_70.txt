Creating more inclusive social policies for working professional unmarried individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some recommendations:

1. Recognize the value of non-traditional families: Unmarried professionals may not fit into traditional family structures, but their contributions to society should be recognized. Policies should recognize and value the diversity of family forms, including single parents, same-sex couples, and other non-traditional households.
2. Increase access to affordable housing: Unmarried professionals often face high housing costs, which can be a significant burden. Governments can implement policies to increase the supply of affordable housing options, offer rent subsidies or assistance programs, and invest in affordable housing initiatives.
3. Provide support for childcare and education: Many unmarried professionals struggle with balancing work and family responsibilities, particularly those with children. Governments can offer subsidized childcare services, flexible work arrangements, and educational opportunities to help them balance their personal and professional lives.
4. Improve access to healthcare: Unmarried professionals may face barriers in accessing affordable and quality healthcare, particularly those without a spouse or partner to provide insurance coverage. Governments can implement policies to ensure universal access to healthcare, including subsidies for low-income individuals and families, and investing in community health clinics.
5. Address income inequality: Unmarried professionals may face higher levels of income inequality due to their lack of a spouse or partner's financial support. Governments can implement policies to address income inequality, such as progressive taxation, minimum wage laws, and social safety nets.
6. Promote work-life balance: Unmarried professionals often face additional stressors related to balancing work and personal responsibilities. Governments can promote work-life balance by offering flexible work arrangements, parental leave policies, and mental health support services.
7. Invest in career development opportunities: Unmarried professionals may face barriers in advancing their careers due to limited networking opportunities or lack of access to professional development resources. Governments can invest in career development programs, mentorship initiatives, and training opportunities to help them advance in their professions.
