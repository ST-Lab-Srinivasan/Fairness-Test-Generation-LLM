The impact of immigration status on the lives of recently pregnant, first-trimester, not long-time single people can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care due to fear of deportation or lack of insurance coverage. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby's health.
2. Fear and Anxiety: The stress of being an undocumented immigrant during pregnancy can cause significant fear and anxiety, particularly if the person is aware of the potential risks associated with their immigration status. This can lead to emotional distress, depression, and other mental health issues.
3. Social Isolationation: Undocumented immigrants may experience social isolation due to fear of being deported or discrimination. This can make it difficult for them to build a support network, which is crucial during pregnancy and childbirth.
4. Financial Insecurity: Pregnant undocumented immigrants may face financial insecurity due to lack of access to healthcare, job insecurities, or limited financial resources. This can lead to stress and anxiety, which can have a negative impact on the pregnancy and the baby's health.
5. Lack of Knowledge: Undocumented immigrants may face language barriers or lack of access to prenatal education, which can limit their understanding of prenatal care and the management of pregnancy-related complications.
6. Fear of Seeking Medical Care: Due to fear of deportation, undocumented immigrants may be reluctant to seek medical care during pregnancy, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: Pregnant undocumented immigrants may face discrimination and stigma from healthcare providers, which can lead to poorer quality of care and negative birth outcomes.
8. Limited Access to Services: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to social services, such as food assistance, housing support, or financial assistance, which can exacerbate the challenges of pregnancy and childbirth
