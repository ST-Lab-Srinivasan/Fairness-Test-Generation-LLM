Marriage and family relationships can have a significant impact on the lives of non-disabled Spanish speakers. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Support: Marriage can provide a sense of security and stability, as well as access to emotional and practical support from a partner. This can be especially important for individuals with disabilities who may face additional challenges in their daily lives.
2. Financial Stability: Marriage can bring financial benefits, such as shared income and resources, which can help reduce financial stress and increase overall well-being.
3. Family Responsibilities: Marriage often involves taking on parental responsibilities, which can impact an individual's time, energy, and priorities. This can be especially challenging for individuals with disabilities who may face additional challenges in caring for a family.
4. Social Isolation: Marriage can also lead to social isolation, particularly if the couple moves into a new home together. This can be particularly challenging for individuals with disabilities who may have difficulty leaving their homes or participating in social activities due to mobility issues.
5. Health Benefits: Marriage has been shown to have positive effects on physical and mental health, including lower rates of depression, anxiety, and cardiovascular disease. However, individuals with disabilities may face additional barriers to accessing these benefits due to lack of accessibility or discrimination.
6. Employment Impacts: Marriage can impact an individual's ability to work, particularly if the couple has children or if the partner is unable to provide emotional or practical support. This can be particularly challenging for individuals with disabilities who may face additional barriers in the workplace.
7. Social Inclusion: Marriage can also impact an individual's sense of social inclusion, particularly if they are part of a marginalized group (e.g., LGBTQ+). This can be particularly challenging for individuals with disabilities who may face additional barriers to social inclusion due to ableism or discrimination.
8. Caregiver Stress: Marriage can also lead to increased caregiving responsibilities, particularly if the partner is unable to provide emotional or practical support. This can be particularly challenging for individuals with disabilities who may face additional barriers in accessing care and support.
