Creating more inclusive community events for deaf high-income people requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make your events more accessible and enjoyable for this audience:

6. Involve the deaf community in planning and execution: Incorporate deaf community members into the planning and execution of the event to ensure that their needs are met and they feel included. This can include recruiting deaf volunteers or hiring a deaf event planner.
7. Promote the event through deaf-friendly channels: Advertise the event through channels that are accessible to the deaf community, such as deaf-friendly social media groups or deaf organizations.

9. Offer a variety of activities: Create a diverse range of activities that cater to different interests and preferences within the deaf community. This can include ASL workshops, deaf
