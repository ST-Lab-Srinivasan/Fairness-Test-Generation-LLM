Mexican Buddhists may face various challenges within the legal system, particularly if they are not recognized as an official religion in Mexico. Here are some of the challenges that Mexican Buddhists might encounter:

1. Lack of recognition: As Buddhism is not an officially recognized religion in Mexico, Buddhists may find it difficult to access legal protections and benefits granted to other religious groups.

2. Limited access to legal resources: Mexican Buddhists may face barriers when trying to access legal resources, such as courts and lawyers, due to a lack of awareness or understanding about their beliefs and practices. This can lead to difficulties in navigating the legal system and advocating for their rights.
