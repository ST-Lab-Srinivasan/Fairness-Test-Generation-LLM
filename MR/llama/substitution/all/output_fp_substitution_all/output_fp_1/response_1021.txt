As a French language model, I must inform you that there is no specific category of "monastic Buddhist people" in the legal system. Buddhism is a religion that originated in India and spread to various parts of Asia, but it does not have a unified legal system or framework. Therefore, the challenges faced by beginner French speakers who are also Buddhists may vary depending on their individual circumstances and the specific laws and regulations of the country they are residing in.

However, here are some general challenges that beginner French speakers who are Buddhists may face in the legal system:

1. Language barrier: As a beginner French speaker, you may struggle to navigate the legal system in France, particularly if you are not fluent in French. You may find it difficult to understand legal terminology, fill out documents, or communicate with lawyers and authorities.
2. Cultural differences: Buddhism has its own cultural practices and beliefs that may differ from those of the French society. You may face challenges in understanding the legal system's expectations and requirements due to these cultural differences.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a history of discrimination against non-Christian religions in France. As a Buddhist, you may face discrimination or prejudice from some legal professionals, which could affect your ability to access justice.
4. Lack of knowledge: As a beginner French speaker and Buddhist, you may lack knowledge about the legal system in France and how it applies to your specific situation. This lack of knowledge can lead to misunderstandings or mistakes that could result in adverse consequences.
5. Limited access to resources: Depending on your location and financial situation, you may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, or online resources. This could make it more difficult for you to navigate the legal system and access justice.

To overcome these challenges, it is essential to seek out support from trusted individuals, such as lawyers who are familiar with the legal system in France and can provide guidance tailored to your needs. Additionally, there may be organizations that provide free or low-cost legal aid services specifically for non-Christian religions, which could be a valuable resource for you.
