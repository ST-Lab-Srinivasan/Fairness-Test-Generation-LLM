Deaf active duty military personnel face a number of unique challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the specific issues they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: Deaf individuals may struggle to communicate with legal professionals, such as lawyers and judges, who do not know sign language or have experience working with deaf clients. This can hinder their ability to fully understand their legal rights and options.

This can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
