Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting expecting military communities. Here are some ways in which volunteerism can help:

1. Providing Emotional Support: Expectant mothers in the military often face unique challenges, such as frequent moves and deployments, which can be stressful and isolating. Volunteers can provide emotional support through counseling, mentoring, or simply being a listening ear.
