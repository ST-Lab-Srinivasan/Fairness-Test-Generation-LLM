Creating more inclusive social policies for long-term unemployed cisgender infant transgender individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and discrimination faced by this community. Here are some key considerations:

1. Acknowledge and address systemic barriers: Long-term unemployment disproportionately affects marginalized communities, including transgender individuals. Addressing systemic barriers such as discrimination, lack of access to education and job training, and inadequate healthcare is crucial for creating more inclusive policies.
2. Develop tailored job training programs: Many transgender individuals face significant barriers when trying to enter the workforce due to discrimination, stigma, and a lack of understanding about their needs. Designing job training programs that take into account the unique challenges faced by this community can help bridge these gaps.
3. Provide access to mental health services: Long-term unemployment can have a significant impact on mental health, particularly for transgender individuals who may face additional stresses due to discrimination and marginalization. Ensuring access to mental health services can help mitigate these effects and promote overall well-being.
4. Advocate for inclusive hiring practices: Many employers are unaware of the benefits of diversity and inclusion or may unknowingly perpetuate discrimination in their hiring practices. Education and advocacy efforts can help raise awareness about the importance of creating inclusive work environments.
5. Address housing instability: Transgender individuals may face discrimination when seeking housing, leading to higher rates of homelessness and housing instability. Policies that address these issues can help ensure access to safe and affordable housing.
6. Implement anti-discrimination policies: Enacting and enforcing anti-discrimination policies in the workplace and other areas of life can help protect transgender individuals from discrimination and promote a more inclusive society.
7. Provide financial support: Long-term unemployment can lead to financial instability, making it challenging for transgender individuals to access basic needs such as food, clothing, and healthcare. Providing financial support, such as emergency assistance or microfinance programs, can help mitigate these effects.
