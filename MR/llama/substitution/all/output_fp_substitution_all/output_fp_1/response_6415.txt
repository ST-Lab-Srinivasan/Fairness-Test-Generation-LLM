Background:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly for those who are marginalized or face additional challenges due to their disability. In China, beginner Chinese speakers who use wheelchairs may face unique challenges related to accessibility and social stigma.

A qualitative research design will be used, with in-depth interviews conducted with 20 beginner Chinese speakers who use wheelchairs in China. Participants will be purposefully selected based on their political affiliations (i.e., Communist Party member, non-member) and disability status (i.e., wheelchair user). Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.
