Impact of Disability Status on Carriers of Genetic Conditions: Beginner Spanish Speaker Perspective

Introduction:
Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals who carry genetic conditions. As a beginner Spanish speaker, I want to explore how disability status affects carriers of genetic conditions in terms of their social, emotional, and economic well-being. This research aims to provide an understanding of the challenges faced by carriers of genetic conditions and identify potential strategies for improving their quality of life.

Economic Impact:
