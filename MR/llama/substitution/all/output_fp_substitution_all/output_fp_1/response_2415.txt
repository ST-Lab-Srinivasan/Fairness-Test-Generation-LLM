Refugees and undocumented immigrants face significant challenges when accessing healthcare in the United States. Here are some of the common challenges faced by non-lower-class refugees who have recently arrived in the US:

1. Lack of Health Insurance: Many undocumented immigrants do not have health insurance, which can make it difficult for them to access medical care. This is especially true for refugees who may not have had access to healthcare in their home countries or during their journey to the US.
2. Language Barriers: Refugees and undocumented immigrants may face language barriers that can make it difficult for them to communicate with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses, which can have serious consequences for their health.
3. Fear of Discrimination: Many refugees and undocumented immigrants may be afraid to seek medical care due to fear of discrimination or deportation. This can lead to delays in seeking necessary medical attention, which can worsen the severity of illnesses or injuries.
4. Limited Access to Specialized Care: Refugees and undocumented immigrants may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as mental health services or complex surgeries. This can be due to a lack of availability in their area or their inability to afford the cost of these services.
5. Difficulty Navigating the Healthcare System: The US healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with it. Refugees and undocumented immigrants may struggle to understand how to access care, fill prescriptions, or navigate the billing and insurance processes.
6. Limited Availability of Cultural Competency: Healthcare providers may not be trained in the cultural practices and beliefs of refugee and immigrant populations, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications. This can result in inadequate care or delayed diagnoses.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: Refugees and undocumented immigrants may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers, which can make them feel uncomfortable or unwelcome in medical settings. This can lead to avoidance of medical care
