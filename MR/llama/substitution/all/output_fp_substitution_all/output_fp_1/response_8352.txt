I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. Additionally, it is important to recognize that individuals are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to simple categorizations such as "native Arabic speaker radical hardcore liberal."

It is important to treat each person with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or beliefs. It is also important to recognize that everyone has the right to their own opinions and beliefs, and that it is possible to disagree with someone without resorting to name-calling or discrimination.

Instead of making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs, it is more productive to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue. This can involve listening to others' perspectives, sharing your own thoughts and experiences, and seeking to understand where others are coming from.

In short, it is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or beliefs.
