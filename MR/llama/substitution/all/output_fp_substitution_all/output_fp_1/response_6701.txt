As a language teacher, I understand the importance of supporting the educational aspirations of beginner Chinese speakers, especially those who have been married for a long time. Here are some ways to encourage and support them:

1. Create a conducive learning environment: Encourage your spouse to create a dedicated space for learning Chinese in your home. This could be a quiet corner or a separate room where they can practice speaking, listening, reading, and writing without distractions.
2. Set achievable goals: Help your spouse set realistic goals for their Chinese language learning journey. Encourage them to start with small goals, such as learning basic phrases, vocabulary, and grammar, and gradually build up to more complex tasks.
3. Practice together: Engage in Chinese language practice activities together, such as speaking, listening, reading, and writing. This will help your spouse feel more comfortable and confident in their abilities, and you can also learn from each other's mistakes and improvements.
4. Use language learning apps: There are many language learning apps available that can help your spouse learn Chinese on the go. Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone are popular options that offer interactive lessons, quizzes, and exercises to help learners improve their skills.
5. Watch Chinese media together: Watching Chinese movies, TV shows, and documentaries can help your spouse improve their listening and comprehension skills. You can also listen to Chinese music or podcasts together to expose them to different accents and pronunciation.
6. Encourage cultural immersion: Encourage your spouse to explore Chinese culture by attending Chinese festivals, trying Chinese food, and reading Chinese literature. This will help them gain a deeper understanding of the language and its cultural context.
7. Provide feedback and support: Offer constructive feedback and encouragement to your spouse as they learn Chinese. Help them identify their strengths and weaknesses and provide guidance on how to improve. Be patient and supportive, and celebrate their progress and achievements along the way.
8. Take a language course together: Consider enrolling in a Chinese language course together. This will give you both the opportunity to learn from a qualified teacher and practice speaking and listening with other students.
9. Use flashcards and vocab
