Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support the civic engagement of all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Encourage voting and civic participation: Make sure that all eligible citizens have access to voting booths, polling stations, and other forms of civic participation. Provide information on voting requirements, deadlines, and procedures to ensure that everyone can exercise their right to vote.
2. Promote diversity and inclusion: Foster an environment where everyone feels valued and included in the political process. Encourage diverse perspectives and voices to be heard, and work against discrimination and marginalization of any group.
