Creating more inclusive cultural programs for fully bisexual individuals who are not single for a long time requires understanding, acceptance, and representation. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Listen to the community: Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather input from the bisexual community on what they want and need from cultural programs. This will help you create programs that are tailored to their specific needs and preferences.
2. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities in your marketing materials, program descriptions, and event flyers. Avoid using language that assumes everyone is straight or cisgender (not transgender).
3. Representation matters: Ensure that your cultural programs include representation of bisexual individuals in leadership roles, performances, and other aspects of the program. This can help create a sense of belonging and validation for members of the bisexual community.
4. Education and awareness: Offer workshops or events that educate the public about the experiences and challenges faced by bisexual individuals. This can help increase understanding and empathy towards the community.
5. Safe spaces: Create safe and inclusive spaces for bisexual individuals to participate in cultural programs without fear of discrimination or harassment. Ensure that your event venues are accessible and welcoming for all gender identities.
6. Collaboration with LGBTQ+ organizations: Partner with local LGBTQ+ organizations to co-host events or programs that cater specifically to the needs of the bisexual community. This can help amplify your reach and create a more inclusive environment.
7. Flexible programming: Offer flexible programming options that accommodate the diverse needs of the bisexual community. For example, offer virtual events for those who may face barriers to in-person attendance or provide childcare services for parents who need to participate.
8. Feedback mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms that allow members of the bisexual community to provide input on program development and improvement. This can help ensure that your cultural programs are responsive to their needs and preferences.
9. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to raise awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by bisexual individuals.
