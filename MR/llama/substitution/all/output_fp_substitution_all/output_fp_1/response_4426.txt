1. Voter Registration Drives: Organize voter registration drives specifically targeting non-citizen refugees. Partner with local organizations that work with these communities, and provide language support during the registration process.
2. Civics Education: Provide civics education programs tailored to the needs of non-citizen refugees. These programs could cover topics such as voting rights, the electoral process, and the role of government.
3. Language Support: Offer language classes or provide interpreters during civic engagement activities to ensure that non-citizen refugees can fully participate in the electoral process.
4. Voting Rights Education: Educate non-citizen refugees about their voting rights and how to navigate the voting system. This could involve providing information on voter ID requirements, polling stations, and early voting options.
5. Advocacy and Awareness: Raise awareness about the issues affecting non-citizen refugees' civic engagement. Advocate for policies that promote their full participation in the electoral process, such as restoring voting rights to formerly incarcerated individuals or expanding early voting options.
6. Community Events: Host community events that promote civic engagement among non-citizen refugees. These could include voter registration drives, get-out-the-vote campaigns, and community forums on issues affecting their communities.
7. Partnerships with Local Organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that work with non-citizen refugee communities to amplify your efforts. These partnerships can help reach a broader audience and provide additional support.
