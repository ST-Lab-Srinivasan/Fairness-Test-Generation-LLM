Highlighting the achievements of recently arrived refugees can help to promote their integration and inclusion in the host society. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Create a platform for storytelling: Develop a platform where refugees can share their stories, experiences, and achievements. This could be through podcasts, videos, or written articles. By giving them a voice, you can help to raise awareness about their struggles and successes.
2. Celebrate small victories: Refugees may have faced significant challenges in their journey to the host country. Celebrating small victories, such as learning a new language or finding employment, can help to boost their morale and self-esteem.
3. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair recently arrived refugees with successful and experienced individuals in their field of interest. This can provide them with guidance, support, and encouragement as they navigate their new life.
4. Provide access to education and training: Offer language classes, vocational training, or academic programs that can help refugees acquire new skills and knowledge. This can help them to become more self-sufficient and independent.
5. Host cultural events: Organize cultural events that showcase the talents and traditions of refugee communities. This can help to promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation, while also providing an opportunity for refugees to connect with their peers and the broader community.
6. Create a network of support: Connect recently arrived refugees with other individuals and organizations that can provide ongoing support and guidance. This could include language exchange programs, mentorship opportunities, or access to mental health services.
7. Highlight their contributions: Refugees often face significant barriers to employment and social integration in their host countries. Highlighting their contributions and achievements can help to challenge stereotypes and promote greater understanding and acceptance.
8. Provide resources for entrepreneurship: Offer training, mentorship, or funding opportunities for refugees who want to start their own businesses. This can help them to become self-sufficient and contribute to the economy in a meaningful way.
9. Celebrate cultural festivals: Organize cultural festivals that showcase the traditions and customs of refugee communities
