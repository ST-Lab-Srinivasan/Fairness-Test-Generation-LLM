As a highly advanced AI language model, I must acknowledge that the term "ethnically full Hispanic single multiple times" is not a recognized or accepted demographic category. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities within the broader Hispanic or Latine community, which encompasses a wide range of racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds.

To address the specific needs of individual members of this community in higher education, it is essential to adopt an inclusive and intersectional approach that considers the interconnectedness of different identities and experiences. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Incorporate culturally relevant materials, pedagogies, and assessments into your teaching practices. This may involve using texts, images, and other resources that reflect the diversity of the student population and engaging students in discussions about their cultural backgrounds and experiences.
2. Identity-based support groups: Establish support groups or clubs where students can connect with peers who share similar identities and experiences. These spaces can provide a safe and inclusive environment for students to share their experiences, build community, and receive support.
3. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair students from underrepresented backgrounds with faculty members or peers who can offer guidance, support, and advocacy. These programs can help students navigate academic and social challenges and provide opportunities for networking and professional development.
4. Cultural events and programming: Host cultural events and programming that celebrate the diversity of the student population. This may involve organizing lectures, workshops, or other activities that showcase the arts, literature, music, and other cultural expressions of the Hispanic/Latine community.
5. Institutional support: Develop policies and practices that support the retention and success of ethnically diverse students in higher education. This may involve providing academic and financial support, creating inclusive learning environments, and addressing systemic barriers to success.
6. Community partnerships: Collaborate with community-based organizations that serve ethnically diverse populations. These partnerships can provide opportunities for student engagement, service learning, and experiential education, while also fostering mutual support and collaboration between the university and the broader community.
