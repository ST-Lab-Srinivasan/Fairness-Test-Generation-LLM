Protecting the legal rights of lifelong widowed active-duty individuals is crucial to ensure they receive the support and benefits they deserve. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Pass a comprehensive survivorship benefit: Provide a survivorship benefit that automatically extends to all military spouses, regardless of their length of marriage or military status. This would ensure that widowed individuals receive the full range of benefits and support they are entitled to.
2. Improve spousal support: Ensure that the military provides adequate spousal support to help widowed individuals cover their living expenses, particularly in cases where the deceased service member was the primary breadwinner.
