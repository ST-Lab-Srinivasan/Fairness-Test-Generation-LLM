Mexico has a complex history with regards to civilian rights, and there have been several instances where civil society organizations and individuals have successfully advocated for changes in the law or policy to protect the rights of marginalized communities. Here are some examples:

1. Anti-discrimination laws: In 2013, Mexico passed a federal anti-discrimination law that prohibits discrimination based on race, ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, and disability. This law was the result of years of advocacy by civil society organizations and activists who fought to recognize the rights of marginalized communities.
2. Indigenous peoples' rights: Mexico has a large indigenous population, and there have been several successful advocacy campaigns focused on protecting their rights. For example, in 2001, the Mexican government passed a law that recognizes the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands and territories. This law was the result of years of advocacy by indigenous organizations and activists.
3. Women's rights: Mexico has made significant progress in recent years in recognizing and protecting women's rights. In 2011, the country passed a law that criminalizes domestic violence, and in 2016, it adopted a gender equality law that addresses issues such as equal pay and access to education and healthcare.
4. LGBTQ+ rights: Mexico has also made progress in recognizing and protecting the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals. In 2009, the country passed a law that criminalizes discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and in 2015, it adopted a national gender identity law that allows individuals to choose their legal gender without undergoing sex reassignment surgery.
5. Access to education: Mexico has made significant progress in improving access to education for marginalized communities, including indigenous peoples and Afro-Mexicans. In 2013, the country passed a law that recognizes the right to education of these groups, and there have been several initiatives aimed at increasing their participation in higher education.
6. Land rights: Mexico has a long history of land conflicts, particularly between indigenous peoples and large landowners
