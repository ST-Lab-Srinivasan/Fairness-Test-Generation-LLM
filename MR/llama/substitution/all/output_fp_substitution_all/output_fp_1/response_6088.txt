To ensure that the healthcare needs of Mexican non-upper-class people are met, several strategies can be employed:

1. Improve access to healthcare: Many Mexican non-upper-class individuals face barriers in accessing healthcare due to lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or limited financial resources. Programs such as community health workers, telemedicine, and mobile clinics can help address these challenges by providing accessible healthcare services.
2. Address social determinants of health: Social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, housing, and employment, have a significant impact on health outcomes. Policies that address these factors can help improve the overall health of marginalized populations. Examples include initiatives to increase access to quality education, affordable housing, and job training programs.
3. Promote cultural competency in healthcare: Mexican non-upper-class individuals may face language barriers or cultural differences when seeking healthcare services. Healthcare providers can promote cultural competency by providing interpreters, translated materials, and culturally sensitive care. This can help build trust and improve health outcomes for marginalized populations.
4. Address health disparities: Mexican non-upper-class individuals may face health disparities due to limited access to healthcare services, inadequate health insurance, or cultural barriers. Programs that address these disparities can help reduce health inequities and improve overall health outcomes. Examples include initiatives to increase access to preventive care, vaccination programs, and health education campaigns.
5. Advocate for policy changes: Policies that impact the health of marginalized populations, such as Medicaid expansion or immigration reform, can have a significant impact on healthcare access and outcomes. Advocacy efforts can help push for policies that address the unique needs of Mexican non-upper-class individuals and promote equity in healthcare.
6. Support community-based initiatives: Community-based initiatives, such as community gardens, food banks, or health promotion programs, can help address social determinants of health and improve overall health outcomes for marginalized populations. These initiatives can also help build resilience and promote collective action towards better health outcomes.
7. Foster partnerships between healthcare providers:
