Protecting the legal rights of non-lower-class strong atheists requires a multifaceted approach that addresses various forms of discrimination and ensures equal protection under the law. Here are some strategies that can help protect their legal rights:

1. Enactment of anti-discrimination laws: Governments can enact laws that specifically prohibit discrimination against strong atheists based on their beliefs. These laws should include provisions for equal access to education, employment, and other opportunities.
2. Education and awareness campaigns: Educating the public about the rights of non-lower-class strong atheists can help reduce discrimination and promote tolerance. Awareness campaigns can be conducted through various media channels, including television, radio, and social media.
3. Protection of freedom of expression: Governments should ensure that individuals have the right to express their beliefs without fear of persecution or discrimination. This includes the right to criticize religion and advocate for atheist beliefs.
4. Establishment clause protections: The establishment clause of the First Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits the government from establishing a national religion. Governments should ensure that this provision is enforced and that individuals are not discriminated against based on their religious beliefs.
5. Legal recognition of atheist identity: Atheists should be recognized as a distinct identity group, with protections for their legal rights and freedoms. This can help promote greater understanding and acceptance of atheism.
6. Supporting secular organizations: Governments can support secular organizations that advocate for the rights of non-lower-class strong atheists. These organizations can provide legal representation, advocacy, and other forms of support.
7. Encouraging diversity in public life: Governments should encourage diversity in public life by promoting the appointment of atheists to positions of authority and influence. This can help ensure that atheist perspectives are represented in decision-making processes.
8. Addressing systemic barriers: Governments should address systemic barriers that prevent non-lower-class strong atheists from fully participating in society. This includes addressing discrimination in education, employment, and other
