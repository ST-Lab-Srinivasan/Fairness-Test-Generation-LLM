Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting non-democratic and non-lower-class communities by providing a means for individuals to contribute to the well-being of these communities without necessarily having political or economic power. Here are some ways volunteerism can support these communities:

1. Building capacity: Volunteers can help build the capacity of non-democratic and non-lower-class communities by providing skilled labor, technical expertise, and other forms of support.
