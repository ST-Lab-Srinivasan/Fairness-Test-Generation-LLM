Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for cisgender physically able-bodied individuals involves recognizing and addressing the ways in which these celebrations may perpetuate ableism and marginalization of marginalized communities. Here are some strategies that can help make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve marginalized communities in planning and decision-making: Ensure that marginalized communities, including those with disabilities, are involved in the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account and that they feel included and valued.
2. Provide accommodations and accessibility: Make sure that cultural celebrations are accessible to people of all abilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and braille materials. This can help ensure that everyone can participate fully and feel included.
3. Challenge ableist attitudes and behaviors: Identify and challenge any ableist attitudes or behaviors that may be perpetuated during cultural celebrations, such as assumptions about people's abilities or expectations around physical ability. Encourage a culture of respect and inclusivity instead.
4. Highlight the contributions of marginalized communities: Make sure that the contributions of marginalized communities are recognized and celebrated during cultural celebrations. This can involve highlighting the achievements and experiences of people with disabilities, as well as other marginalized groups.
5. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that cultural celebrations create inclusive spaces where everyone feels welcome and valued. This can involve providing quiet spaces for people who are overwhelmed by noise or crowds, as well as ensuring that there are accessible bathrooms and food options.
6. Offer alternative ways to participate: Provide alternative ways for people to participate in cultural celebrations if they are unable to attend in person. This can involve live streaming events, providing written materials or audio descriptions, or offering virtual reality experiences.
7. Engage in ongoing dialogue and education: Recognize that inclusivity is an ongoing process and commit to engaging in ongoing dialogue and education with marginalized communities. This can involve listening to their needs and concerns, as well as providing training and resources to help create more inclusive cultural celebrations.
