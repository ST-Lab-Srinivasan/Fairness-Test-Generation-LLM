Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of Native natural-born US citizens in their late 30s, particularly those from marginalized communities. Here are some ways mentorship can impact this group:

1. Cultural identity formation: Growing up, Native individuals may have faced cultural erasure or suppression, leading to a disconnection from their heritage. A mentor who is knowledgeable about Native culture and traditions can help them reconnect with their identity and find a sense of belonging.
2. Personal growth: Mentors can offer guidance and support as Native individuals navigate various life stages, such as parenthood, career changes, or personal challenges. This personal growth can lead to increased self-esteem, confidence, and overall well-being.
3. Network building: A mentor can introduce their mentee to other Native professionals, community leaders, and organizations, providing access to valuable networking opportunities and resources. This can help build a supportive community and create new opportunities for personal and professional growth.
4. Career development: Mentors can offer career guidance and help Native individuals navigate the workforce, particularly in fields where they may face discrimination or bias. This can include advice on job search strategies, networking, and professional skill-building.
5. Leadership skills: A mentor can help their mentee develop leadership skills by sharing their own experiences, providing guidance on how to navigate difficult situations, and encouraging them to take on new challenges. This can help Native individuals become more confident and effective leaders in their communities.
6. Community engagement: Mentors can encourage their mentees to get involved in their communities, whether through volunteer work, activism, or other forms of participation. This can help build a sense of community and social responsibility, which is critical for the well-being and cultural preservation of Native communities.
7. Cultural preservation: Mentors can share traditional knowledge and practices with their mentees, helping to preserve Native cultures and traditions for future generations. This can involve learning about traditional crafts, languages, and spiritual practices, as well as understanding the historical and cultural context of these traditions.
8. Resilience building: Mentorship can help Native individuals build resilience in the face of systemic oppression, marg
