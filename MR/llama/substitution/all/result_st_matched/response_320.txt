Creating more inclusive social policies for average earners who are not in a relationship requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this demographic. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize the distinct needs of average earners: Average earners face significant barriers to social and economic mobility, including limited access to education and job opportunities, discrimination, and lack of support systems. Policies should prioritize addressing these specific challenges.
2. Foster affordable housing options: Many average earners struggle to afford decent housing, leading to overcrowding, substandard living conditions, and increased poverty risk. Governments can invest in subsidized housing programs, rent control measures, and initiatives that encourage affordable homeownership.
3. Improve access to quality education: Average earners often lack access to quality educational opportunities, which hinders their ability to advance professionally and economically. Policies should prioritize increasing funding for public schools, providing scholarships and financial aid, and promoting vocational training programs.
4. Enhance job opportunities and career advancement: Average earners often face limited job prospects and low wages, which can trap them in a cycle of poverty. Governments can invest in workforce development programs, provide incentives for businesses to hire and train local workers, and promote entrepreneurship and small business growth.
5. Provide financial support: Average earners often lack access to financial resources, making it difficult to cover basic needs such as healthcare, childcare, and transportation. Policies can provide financial assistance through tax credits, subsidies, or direct payments to individuals.
6. Address discrimination and inequality: Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and other factors can further marginalize average earners. Policies should actively address these issues through anti-discrimination laws, diversity initiatives, and targeted support for historically disadvantaged groups.
7. Encourage community engagement: Average earners often feel disconnected from society and lack opportunities for social interaction and civic participation. Policies can promote community engagement through volunteer programs, community service initiatives
