Protecting the legal rights of expectant and non-disabled individuals is crucial to ensure their well-being and safety during pregnancy and childbirth. Here are some ways to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Enacting and enforcing anti-discrimination laws that protect expectant and non-disabled individuals from discrimination in the workplace, healthcare, and other areas of life can help ensure their legal rights are protected.
2. Access to Healthcare: Ensuring access to quality and accessible healthcare for expectant and non-disabled individuals is crucial for their well-being during pregnancy and childbirth. This includes providing access to prenatal care, birthing options, and postpartum care.

This means providing them with accurate and unbiased information about their options and allowing them to make choices based on their own preferences and values.
4. Supportive Legislation: Passing legislation that supports the rights of expectant and non-disabled individuals can help ensure their legal rights are protected. For example, laws that provide paid parental leave or flexible work arrangements can help support individuals during pregnancy and after childbirth.

This includes advocating for their rights in healthcare settings, as well as in legal and administrative proceedings.
