Individuals with undiagnosed or unexplained medical symptoms or conditions often face unique challenges in the healthcare system. These challenges may include:

1. Difficulty in receiving a diagnosis or treatment: Without a known genetic condition, it can be challenging for healthcare providers to identify the underlying cause of an individual's symptoms or medical issues. This can lead to delays in diagnosis or inadequate treatment.
2. Misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis: Healthcare providers may misinterpret or miss the diagnosis of a condition due to the lack of clear genetic markers or testing results. This can result in inappropriate or ineffective treatments, leading to further frustration and discomfort for the individual.
3. Limited access to specialized care: Individuals with unexplained medical conditions may have limited access to specialized care or expertise due to a lack of knowledge about their condition.

Emotional and psychological distress: Living with an unexplained medical condition can cause significant emotional and psychological distress, including anxiety, depression, and feelings of helplessness. Individuals may feel frustrated or defeated by their inability to receive a clear diagnosis or effective treatment.
