Promoting the cultural integration of individuals with a genetic condition, particularly those who are now aged 65 and older, requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and cultural barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help promote cultural integration:

This can help reduce stigma and promote understanding and acceptance of individuals with genetic conditions.
2. Support groups: Facilitate the creation of support groups for older adults with genetic conditions, where they can share their experiences and connect with others who are going through similar challenges. These groups can provide a safe space for individuals to discuss their feelings, receive emotional support, and find practical advice.
