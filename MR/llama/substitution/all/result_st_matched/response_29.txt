1. Create a safe and inclusive space: Ensure that the leadership development program is free from discrimination, harassment, and marginalization based on gender identity or expression. Provide a safe and welcoming environment for all participants, including those who may be gender-nonconforming.
2. Use inclusive language and materials: Avoid using language or materials that reinforce traditional gender roles or expectations. Instead, use inclusive language and examples that recognize the diversity of gender identities and expressions.
