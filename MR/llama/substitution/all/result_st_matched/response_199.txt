Children living in deep poverty who have a genetic condition may face significant challenges and barriers to their health, well-being, and development. These children may be more susceptible to malnutrition, infections, and other health problems due to the poverty and lack of access to basic necessities like food, clean water, and proper medical care. They may also experience social isolation and stigma due to their genetic condition, which can further exacerbate the negative impacts of poverty on their mental and emotional well-being.

Some specific impacts of genetic conditions on children living in deep poverty may include:

1. Delayed development: Children with genetic conditions may experience delays in physical, cognitive, and social development due to the underlying genetic mutation. This can lead to difficulties in school, social interactions, and independence.
2. Increased risk of infections: Children living in poverty may be more susceptible to infections due to poor living conditions, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, and malnutrition. Genetic conditions can further compromise the immune system, increasing the risk of infections and complications.
3. Malnutrition: Children with genetic conditions may have a higher risk of malnutrition due to difficulties in accessing nutritious food, or difficulty absorbing nutrients due to gastrointestinal problems. Malnutrition can exacerbate the symptoms of the genetic condition and increase the risk of other health problems.
4. Limited access to healthcare: Children living in deep poverty may have limited access to healthcare services, including specialized care for genetic conditions. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, which can worsen the impacts of the condition on the child's health and well-being.
5. Stigma and social isolation: Children with genetic conditions may experience stigma and social isolation due to their condition, which can further affect their mental and emotional well-being. This can be particularly challenging for children living in deep poverty, where access to support services and resources may be limited.
6. Increased risk of developmental delays: Genetic conditions can increase the risk of developmental delays, including
