The impact of military status on the lives of ex-spouses in their mid-50s can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Financial Instability: Military spouses often face financial instability due to the unpredictable nature of military deployments, training exercises, and changes in their partner's duty station. This instability can make it challenging for ex-spouses to plan for their financial future, particularly as they enter their mid-50s and may be facing increased expenses related to aging.
2. Emotional Distress: The stress of being a military spouse can take an emotional toll on individuals, particularly during deployments or when faced with the challenges of reintegration after deployment. Ex-spouses in their mid-50s may experience emotional distress related to the breakdown of their marriage, including feelings of grief, anger, and sadness.
3. Social Isolation: Military spouses often face social isolation due to the frequent moves and deployments associated with military service. Ex-spouses in their mid-50s may find themselves struggling to establish new social networks and friendships, particularly if they have outgrown their existing social circles.

Ex-spouses in their mid-50s may be more susceptible to these health issues, particularly if they have been impacted by multiple deployments or extended periods of separation.
5. Lack of Support: Military spouses often feel a lack of support from their partner's military chain of command, particularly when it comes to addressing issues related to domestic violence, sexual assault, or other forms of mistreatment. Ex-spouses in their mid-50s may struggle to access support services and resources, particularly if they are no longer eligible for military benefits.
