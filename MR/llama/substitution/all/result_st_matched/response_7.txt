Creating more inclusive social policies for elite unmarried individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize the diversity of elite unmarried individuals: Elite unmarried individuals come from diverse backgrounds, including those who are LGBTQ+, people of color, have disabilities, or belong to other marginalized groups. Policies should be designed to address the specific needs and challenges faced by these subgroups within the elite unmarried population.
2. Address economic inequality: Elite unmarried individuals often face significant economic disparities compared to their married peers. Policies can aim to reduce income inequality, such as progressive taxation, affordable healthcare, and access to education and job training programs.
3. Promote social cohesion: Elite unmarried individuals may feel isolated or disconnected from society due to their marital status. Policies can foster social cohesion by promoting community engagement, volunteer work, and other activities that encourage connection and belonging.
4. Address discrimination: Unfortunately, elite unmarried individuals may encounter discrimination based on their marital status. Policies can work to combat this discrimination by prohibiting discrimination in employment, housing, and other areas of life.
5. Encourage supportive policies for caregivers: Many elite unmarried individuals are caregivers for children, parents, or other family members. Policies can recognize the valuable contributions of caregivers by providing support such as paid family leave, flexible work arrangements, and access to affordable childcare.
6. Foster inclusive social networks: Elite unmarried individuals may lack access to social networks that can provide emotional and practical support. Policies can promote the development of inclusive social networks by encouraging intergenerational connections, mentorship programs, and other initiatives that foster social capital.
7. Provide affordable housing: Elite unmarried individuals may struggle with finding affordable housing options, particularly in urban areas. Policies can prioritize affordable housing options and provide subsidies or incentives for developers to build more affordable housing units.
