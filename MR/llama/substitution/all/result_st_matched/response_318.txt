Creating more inclusive social policies for financially disadvantaged ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the role of gender and power dynamics: Ex-spouses, particularly women, often face financial insecurity due to systemic gender inequality. Policies should acknowledge this and address the power imbalances that contribute to their disadvantage.
