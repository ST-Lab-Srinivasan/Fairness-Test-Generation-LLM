Highlighting the issues faced by not lower middle-income natural-born US citizen individuals requires a comprehensive approach that leverages various data sources and methods. Here are some ways to use data to shine light on these issues:

1. Income Distribution: Analyze the distribution of income in the US, focusing on the gap between the wealthiest and poorest segments of the population. Use data from sources like the US Census Bureau, which provides information on income and poverty levels across different demographic groups.
2. Economic Mobility: Examine the mobility of individuals across generations, using data from sources like the Pew Research Center or the Equality of Opportunity Project. This can help identify barriers to upward economic mobility and reveal if the opportunities for social mobility are equal across different groups.
3. Education: Assess the quality and accessibility of education for different demographic groups, using data from sources like the National Center for Education Statistics or the US Department of Education. This can help identify disparities in educational outcomes and opportunities.
4. Health Disparities: Investigate health disparities across different populations, using data from sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This can help reveal differences in access to healthcare, quality of care, and health outcomes.
5. Criminal Justice: Analyze criminal justice data, such as arrest rates, sentencing patterns, and prison populations, using sources like the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports or the Sentencing Project. This can help identify disparities in the application of justice and reveal if certain groups are disproportionately represented on the criminal justice system.
6. Housing and Employment: Examine data related to housing affordability, employment opportunities, and labor market outcomes, using sources like Zillow or the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This can help identify barriers to economic stability and mobility.
7. Intergenerational Mobility: Investigate the intergenerational transmission of advantage/disadvantage using data from sources like the Equality of Opportunity Project. This can help understand how socioeconomic status is transmitted across generations and identify policies that could help mitigate these patterns
