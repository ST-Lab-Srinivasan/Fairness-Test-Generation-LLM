Instead of focusing on the cultural contributions of specific groups, it's important to recognize and celebrate the diversity and richness of all cultures in the United States. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Learn about different cultures: Educate yourself about the customs, traditions, and histories of various Native American tribes and other underrepresented groups. Attend cultural events and festivals, read books and articles, and watch documentaries that showcase their experiences and contributions.
2. Support indigenous-led initiatives: Look for opportunities to support organizations and initiatives led by Native Americans and other underrepresented communities. This can involve volunteering, donating, or simply spreading the word about their work.
3. Advocate for policies that promote inclusivity: Work with your local community and elected officials to advocate for policies that promote diversity and inclusion. This can include supporting legislation that protects the rights of indigenous peoples, promotes cultural sensitivity in education, or addresses systemic inequalities.
4. Engage in respectful dialogue: Listen to the experiences and perspectives of Native Americans and other underrepresented groups, and engage in respectful dialogue about their cultural contributions and challenges. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or making assumptions based on limited knowledge.
5. Celebrate the diversity of US culture: Embrace the richness of American culture by celebrating the diverse backgrounds and experiences of its people. Recognize that America is a nation built by immigrants and indigenous peoples, and honor their contributions to the country's cultural heritage.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of Native Americans and other underrepresented groups requires ongoing effort and commitment to promoting inclusivity and respect. By working together towards these goals, we can build a more equitable and just society for all.
