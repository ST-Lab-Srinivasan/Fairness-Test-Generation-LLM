Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of Native American, or Indigenous peoples, who are just above the poverty line. Cultural diversity refers to the variety of cultural practices, beliefs, and values that exist within a particular community or society. For Native Americans, cultural diversity is crucial for several reasons:

1. Preservation of Traditions: Cultural diversity helps preserve traditional practices, customs, and beliefs that are unique to Indigenous peoples. These traditions are an essential part of their identity and heritage, and they provide a sense of connection to their ancestors and community.
2. Identity and Sense of Self: Cultural diversity helps Native Americans maintain their sense of identity and self-esteem. It allows them to express themselves through traditional arts, music, and dance, which are an integral part of their culture.
3. Preservation of Language: Many Indigenous languages are at risk of disappearing due to the loss of speakers or the dominance of colonial languages. Cultural diversity helps preserve these languages by promoting language revitalization programs and cultural education.
4. Resilience and Adaptability: Cultural diversity teaches Native Americans the importance of resilience and adaptability in the face of adversity. It allows them to draw on their cultural practices and traditions to cope with challenges such as poverty, discrimination, and historical trauma.
5. Community Building: Cultural diversity fosters a sense of community among Native Americans. It provides a shared identity and purpose, which helps build stronger relationships within the community.
6. Economic Benefits: Cultural tourism can provide economic benefits for Native American communities. By promoting cultural events and attractions, communities can generate income and create jobs.
7. Education and Empowerment: Cultural diversity provides opportunities for education and empowerment. It helps Native Americans learn about their history, traditions, and cultural practices, which can lead to greater self-awareness and self-esteem.
8. Healing and Wellness: Cultural diversity can promote healing and wellness among Native Americans. By connecting with their cultural heritage, they can find spiritual and emotional balance in their lives.
9. Intergenerational Relationships: Cultural diversity helps strengthen intergenerational relationships
