Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower-class natural-born US citizen people are met is a critical issue that requires attention and action from various stakeholders, including policymakers, healthcare providers, and community organizations. Here are some strategies that can help address this challenge:

1. Expand access to affordable health insurance: One of the primary barriers to accessing healthcare for lower-class individuals is lack of health insurance.
