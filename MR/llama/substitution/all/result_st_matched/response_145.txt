5. Job readiness resources: Provide access to job readiness resources, such as resume writing workshops, interview practice sessions, and job listings specific to their skills and experience.
6. Networking opportunities: Create opportunities for former soldiers to connect with potential employers, mentors, and peers. This can be done through speed networking events, roundtable discussions, or group activities.
