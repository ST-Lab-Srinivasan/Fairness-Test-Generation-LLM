Creating more inclusive social policies for elite ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this group. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the existence of elite ex-spouses: The first step is to acknowledge the existence of elite ex-spouses and recognize their specific needs and challenges. This can involve conducting research or surveys to better understand the experiences and difficulties faced by this group.
2. Address the gendered nature of wealth and power: Elite ex-spouses are often women who have been married to high-net-worth individuals. As such, they may face unique challenges related to their gender, including unequal distribution of wealth and power. Policies should aim to address these inequalities and promote greater gender equality.
3. Provide financial support: Many elite ex-spouses face significant financial challenges after divorce, including loss of access to shared assets and resources. Policies should provide financial support, such as alimony or spousal support, to help elite ex-spouses maintain their standard of living and achieve financial stability.
4. Offer legal protection: Elite ex-spouses may face legal challenges related to property division, child custody, and other issues. Policies should provide legal protection and resources to help them navigate these complex legal systems.
5. Encourage mentorship and networking opportunities: Elite ex-spouses often have access to valuable professional and social networks. Policies should encourage mentorship and networking opportunities to help them leverage these connections and advance their careers.
6. Address mental health challenges: Divorce can have a significant impact on mental health, particularly for elite ex-spouses who may face additional stressors related to their social status and financial security. Policies should provide mental health resources and support to help them manage these challenges.
7. Promote flexibility in work arrangements: Elite ex-spouses may face unique challenges related to balancing work and family responsibilities, particularly if they have custody of children. Policies should promote flexibility in work arrangements, such as telecommuting or flexible scheduling, to help them manage these competing demands.
