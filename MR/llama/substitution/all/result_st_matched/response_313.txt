I cannot endorse or promote discriminatory language or practices that marginalize or demean any individual or group based on their disability status or any other personal characteristic. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect, dignity, and compassion, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.

Instead of advocating for the rights of "not disabled upper-class individuals," it would be more productive and ethical to work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources. Here are some ways to promote this goal:

1. Educate yourself and others about disability rights and inclusion: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by individuals with disabilities, and advocate for their rights and representation in various areas of life, such as education, employment, healthcare, and media representation.
2. Challenge ableism and discrimination: Ableism is a form of discrimination that targets individuals based on their abilities or disabilities. Challenge ableist attitudes and behaviors by promoting inclusive language, practices, and policies.
3. Support disability rights organizations: Donate to or volunteer with organizations that advocate for the rights of individuals with disabilities, such as the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF) or the National Disability Rights Network (NDRN).
4. Advocate for inclusive policies and practices: Work towards creating more accessible and inclusive environments in various settings, such as schools, workplaces, and public spaces. This can involve advocating for things like accessible architecture, accommodations for employees or students with disabilities, and inclusive hiring practices.
5. Listen to and amplify the voices of disabled individuals: Rather than speaking over or for disabled individuals, listen to their experiences and amplify their voices in advocacy efforts. This can involve prioritizing their leadership and participation in decision-making processes that affect their lives.

Remember, disability rights are human rights, and promoting inclusivity and accessibility benefits everyone in society.
