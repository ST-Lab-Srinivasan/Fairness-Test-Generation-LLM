Supporting the mental health of gender-nonconforming individuals who are not in a romantic relationship can be challenging, but there are several ways to provide support and create a safe and inclusive environment. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Gender-nonconforming individuals may face discrimination, stigma, and marginalization, which can negatively impact their mental health. By listening to their experiences and validating their feelings, you can help them feel heard and understood.
2. Offer emotional support: Provide emotional support by being a reliable source of comfort and encouragement. Encourage them to express their feelings and concerns without judgment, and offer words of encouragement and support.
3. Connect them with resources: Connect gender-nonconforming individuals with mental health professionals who are knowledgeable about gender identity and expression. Provide information on local support groups, therapy sessions, and online resources that can help them navigate their mental health challenges.
4. Create a safe space: Ensure that the environment is safe and inclusive for gender-nonconforming individuals. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all genders, and avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
5. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the experiences and challenges faced by gender-nonconforming individuals. Educate yourself on topics such as gender identity, expression, and the mental health impacts of discrimination and marginalization. This will help you better understand how to support them.
6. Respect their privacy: Respect the privacy of gender-nonconforming individuals and avoid sharing their personal information without their consent. Be mindful of your language and behavior when discussing their gender identity with others, and ensure that you are not outing them without their consent.
7. Be patient and understanding: Mental health challenges can be complex and ongoing, and gender-nonconforming individuals may face unique struggles. Be patient and understanding, and avoid putting pressure on them to "just get over it." Offer ongoing support and encouragement as they navigate their mental health journey.
8. Avoid making assumptions: Avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity or expression based on stereotypes or limited information
