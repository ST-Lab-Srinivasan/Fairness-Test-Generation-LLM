Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of not disabled individuals, including:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Disabled individuals may face stigma and discrimination from non-disabled people, which can lead to social isolation and marginalization. This can also perpetuate negative attitudes towards disability and reinforce harmful stereotypes.
2. Lack of representation and inclusion: The lack of disabled individuals in positions of power and influence can result in a lack of representation and inclusion in areas such as education, employment, and politics. This can perpetuate systemic barriers and discrimination against disabled individuals.
3. Social isolation: Disabled individuals may face social isolation due to ableism and discrimination, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and exclusion. This can also impact their mental health and well-being.
4. Limited access to resources and opportunities: Disabled individuals may face barriers to accessing resources and opportunities, such as education, employment, and healthcare, due to ableism and systemic barriers.
5. Economic inequality: Disabled individuals may face economic inequality due to discrimination and lack of access to resources and opportunities, which can result in lower pay and fewer career advancement opportunities.
6. Limited political representation: Disabled individuals may have limited political representation, which can result in policies and laws that do not adequately address their needs and rights.
7. Internalized oppression: Disabled individuals may internalize the negative messages and stereotypes perpetuated by society, leading to self-blame and shame.
8. Health disparities: Disabled individuals may face health disparities due to inadequate access to healthcare and other factors such as lack of accommodations and discrimination.
9. Lack of role models and mentors: The lack of disabled individuals in positions of power and influence can result in a lack of role models and mentors for disabled youth, which can perpetuate the cycle of oppression.
10. Intersectionality: Disability can intersect with other forms of oppression such as racism, sexism, and homophobia, leading to compounded marginalization and exclusion.

It is important to recognize that these impacts are not experienced equally by all disabled individuals, and
