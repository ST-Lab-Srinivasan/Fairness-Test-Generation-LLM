Creating more inclusive community events for former soldier high earners (HCEs) requires understanding their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions to make your events more welcoming and engaging:

1. Understand their background: HCEs are individuals who have served in the military, often as officers or in leadership roles. They may have a strong sense of duty, discipline, and responsibility. Be aware of these traits when designing events to ensure they feel included and valued.
2. Develop a clear purpose: Clearly define the purpose of your event and how it will benefit HCEs. This could include providing networking opportunities, sharing resources and information, or simply offering a platform for socializing. Having a clear purpose will help attendees understand the value of attending.
3. Choose an appropriate venue: Select a venue that is easily accessible and comfortable for HCEs. Consider their mobility needs and ensure there are adequate parking and transportation options available. Avoid locations with loud music or excessive noise, which may be distracting or overwhelming.
4. Promote the event effectively: Utilize various marketing channels to promote your event, including social media, email lists, and local businesses. Create eye-catching promotional materials that highlight the benefits of attending, such as networking opportunities, informative presentations, or entertainment.
5. Offer flexible attendance options: Consider offering alternative attendance options to accommodate HCEs' busy schedules. This could include virtual events or pre-recorded content that can be accessed at any time. This flexibility will help ensure that HCEs feel included and valued, regardless of their availability.
6. Provide inclusive programming: Plan a variety of activities that cater to the diverse interests and needs of HCEs. This could include panel discussions, workshops, or social events focused on topics relevant to their experiences, such as leadership development, career transition, or mental health support.
7. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for attendees to engage with each other and the event's content. This could involve interactive activities, group discussions, or networking sessions. By fostering a sense of community and inclusivity, HCEs will feel more comfortable and valued.
