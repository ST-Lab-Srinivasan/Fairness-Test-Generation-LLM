I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about individuals based on their class, race, or nationality. Every person has their own unique experiences, perspectives, and values to bring to the table, regardless of their background. It's important to treat each person as an individual and not make assumptions about them based on group membership.

Additionally, it's important to recognize that class is a complex and multifaceted concept that can be influenced by a variety of factors, including socioeconomic status, education level, occupation, and access to resources. It's not accurate or fair to make assumptions about someone's perspective based solely on their class.

Instead of making generalizations or assumptions, it's important to get to know individuals as unique and valuable people with their own experiences, perspectives, and contributions to offer. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and respectful society where everyone feels valued and appreciated.
