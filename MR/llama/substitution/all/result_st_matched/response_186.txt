I must clarify that the term "Native natural-born US citizen high society people" is quite broad and encompasses a diverse group of individuals with different cultural backgrounds, identities, and experiences. However, I can suggest some ways to celebrate and appreciate the cultural contributions of Native American communities in the United States:

1. Learn about Native American history and culture: Read books, watch documentaries, attend cultural events, and engage in conversations with Native Americans to learn about their rich cultural heritage.
2. Support Native-owned businesses: Show your appreciation for Native American culture by shopping at Native-owned businesses, attending cultural festivals, and promoting Native American artists and artisans.
