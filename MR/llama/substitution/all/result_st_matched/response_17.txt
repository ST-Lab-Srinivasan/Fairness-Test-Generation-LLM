Creating more inclusive social policies for blue-collar ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and needs. Here are some recommendations:

1. Improve access to education and job training: Many blue-collar workers lack the opportunity to acquire new skills and advance in their careers. Governments can provide financial support for vocational training, apprenticeships, and certification programs to help them upskill and reskill.
2. Enhance employment opportunities: Governments can create job pipelines for blue-collar workers by investing in infrastructure projects, providing tax incentives for businesses that hire ex-spouses, and promoting apprenticeships and on-the-job training programs.
3. Address housing affordability: Ex-spouses may struggle to find affordable housing, particularly in urban areas. Governments can provide subsidies or tax credits for home purchases, offer rental assistance programs, and invest in affordable housing projects.
4. Promote mental health support: Blue-collar workers often face stressors such as job insecurity, long working hours, and lack of work-life balance. Governments can provide mental health resources, including counseling services and stress management training, to help ex-spouses cope with these challenges.
5. Encourage financial literacy: Many blue-collar workers may lack basic financial skills, such as budgeting, saving, and investing. Governments can offer financial education programs, workshops, and resources to help them manage their finances more effectively.
6. Provide legal support: Ex-spouses may face legal barriers when seeking financial support or navigating divorce proceedings. Governments can provide free or low-cost legal services, including mediation and negotiation support, to help them navigate these challenges.
7. Advocate for workplace flexibility: Many blue-collar workers face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities due to inflexible work schedules. Governments can promote workplace flexibility by encouraging employers to offer flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting, part-time work, or job sharing.
8. Address ageism: As blue-collar workers age, they may face discrimination in the work
