It is important to recognize that disability is a complex and multifaceted issue that affects individuals and families in different ways. In Mexico, as in many other countries, individuals with genetic conditions may face various challenges that can impact their lives in significant ways. Here are some of the potential impacts of disability status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions among Mexican people:

1. Social and cultural stigma: In some cultures, disability is still perceived as a curse or a sign of weakness. As a result, individuals with genetic conditions may face social exclusion, discrimination, and stigma, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Many carriers of genetic conditions in Mexico may face barriers when trying to access education or find employment due to discrimination, lack of accommodations, or limited access to resources. This can lead to poverty, social isolation, and reduced opportunities for personal growth.
3. Financial burden: Carrying a genetic condition can result in significant medical expenses, including high costs for treatments, therapies, and specialized care. This can put a heavy financial burden on families, particularly those with limited economic resources.
4. Limited access to healthcare: In some regions of Mexico, individuals with disabilities may have limited access to healthcare services, including specialized medical care and rehabilitation therapies. This can exacerbate the impact of a genetic condition and limit opportunities for early intervention and support.
5. Emotional and psychological distress: Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging, particularly when faced with social stigma, discrimination, or limited access to resources. Carriers may experience anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues as a result.
6. Impact on family dynamics: Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on family dynamics, particularly in traditional or patriarchal societies where the burden of care may fall primarily on women. This can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, or isolation among family members.
7. Limited social support: In some communities, individuals with disabilities may have limited access to social support networks, including friends, family, and peer groups. This
