I cannot provide information that promotes or perpetuates negative stereotypes or discrimination towards any social group, including lower-class Mexican people. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect within the legal system.

However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by marginalized communities in Mexico when interacting with the legal system. These challenges may include:

1. Lack of access to legal resources: Marginalized communities may face barriers in accessing legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and other legal services due to financial constraints or lack of infrastructure in their areas.
2. Limited understanding of legal rights: Many individuals from marginalized communities may be unaware of their legal rights and how to navigate the legal system, which can lead to them being taken advantage of or exploited.
3. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist within the legal system in Mexico, and marginalized communities may face unequal treatment or unfair outcomes due to their social status.
4. Lack of representation: Marginalized communities may have limited access to legal representation, which can result in them being overlooked or ignored within the legal system.
5. Social and economic inequality: Social and economic inequality can lead to unequal access to opportunities and resources, which can perpetuate marginalization within the legal system.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are complex and multifaceted, and addressing them will require a comprehensive approach that includes policy changes, education, and community engagement. By working together to address these issues, we can create a more just and equitable legal system for all individuals in Mexico.
