Creating more inclusive social policies for bourgeois partnered individuals requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the unique challenges and opportunities faced by this group. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Acknowledge the intersectionality of identity: Bourgeois partners may face discrimination based on their race, gender, sexuality, class, or other aspects of their identity. Policies should take into account the intersections of these identities and address the unique challenges faced by each individual.
2. Focus on accessibility and affordability: Many bourgeois partners may struggle to access essential services such as healthcare, education, and childcare due to financial constraints. Policies should prioritize accessibility and affordability to ensure that these individuals can fully participate in society.
3. Promote flexible work arrangements: Bourgeois partners may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities, particularly if they are the primary breadwinner for their household. Policies should promote flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or compressed workweeks, to help alleviate these challenges.
4. Invest in mental health support: Bourgeois partners may experience high levels of stress and anxiety due to the demands of their roles and responsibilities. Policies should invest in mental health support services, such as counseling or therapy, to help individuals manage these challenges.
5. Provide financial support: Bourgeois partners may struggle with financial insecurity, particularly if they are not earning a sufficient income to support themselves and their families. Policies should provide financial support, such as subsidized childcare or financial assistance programs, to help alleviate these challenges.
