Creating more inclusive community events for people with genetic conditions requires careful planning and consideration of their needs. Here are some suggestions to make your event more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue is wheelchair-accessible and has enough seating areas for people who may need to rest or escape the noise. Provide audio descriptions or sign language interpreters for people with hearing impairments.

9. Feedback and evaluation: Solicit feedback from attendees and participants to understand what worked well and
