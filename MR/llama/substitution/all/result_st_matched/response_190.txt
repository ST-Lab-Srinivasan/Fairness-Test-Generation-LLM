Permanent residents who have experienced bereavement face unique challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the common difficulties they may encounter:

1. Lack of cultural sensitivity: Bereaved permanent residents may come from diverse backgrounds, and their grief experiences may be influenced by their cultural and religious beliefs.
