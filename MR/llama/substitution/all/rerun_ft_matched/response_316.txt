Creating more inclusive social policies for low-income single individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to affordable housing: Many low-income single individuals struggle to find affordable housing, which can lead to instability and insecurity. Governments can provide subsidies or tax credits to landlords who rent to low-income individuals, or invest in programs that build affordable housing units.
