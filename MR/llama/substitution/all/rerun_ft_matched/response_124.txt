Spanish-Chinese people may face a range of challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in Spanish or Catalan, navigating the legal system can be difficult, particularly when dealing with complex legal procedures or documents written in either language.
2. Cultural differences: The legal systems in Spain and China have different cultural backgrounds and approaches to justice, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications between parties from different cultures.
3. Lack of recognition of Chinese law: In some cases, the legal system in Spain may not recognize or acknowledge the legal principles or practices of Chinese law, which can create challenges for Spanish-Chinese individuals seeking legal redress.
4. Difficulty accessing legal aid: Depending on their economic situation, Spanish-Chinese individuals may struggle to access legal aid or representation, which can limit their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
5. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, there have been instances of discrimination and bias against Spanish-Chinese individuals within the legal system, particularly in cases where cultural differences are not understood or respected.
6. Lack of knowledge about Chinese culture and traditions: The legal system in Spain may not be familiar with the cultural practices and traditions of China, which can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of important evidence or arguments.
7. Difficulty proving cultural differences: Spanish-Chinese individuals may find it challenging to prove that their cultural background and traditions are relevant to their legal case, particularly if the legal system is not familiar with these issues.
8. Limited access to Chinese legal resources: Depending on where they live in Spain, Spanish-Chinese individuals may have limited access to Chinese legal resources or support services, which can make it harder for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
9. Difficulty navigating dual jurisdictions: For Spanish-Chinese individuals who are citizens of both countries, navigating dual legal systems and regulations can be particularly challenging, as they may have different requirements or expectations.
10. Lack of awareness about Chinese law: In some cases, even if the legal system in Spain is familiar with Chinese law, there may be a lack of understanding or awareness about specific aspects of Chinese law and its application to particular cases
