Creating more inclusive community events for first trimester female people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Be aware of the needs of pregnant individuals: During the first trimester, many women may experience morning sickness, fatigue, and other discomforts. Make sure your event is well-ventilated and provides easy access to food, drinks, and restrooms.
2. Provide comfortable seating and breaks: Pregnant individuals may need more frequent breaks to rest and relax. Make sure there are comfortable seating areas available throughout the event, and consider offering break times specifically for attendees who may need them.
3. Offer modifications for pregnant participants: Be flexible with your activities and offer modifications that can accommodate different abilities and comfort levels. For example, provide alternative physical activities for those who may not want to engage in high-impact exercises.
4. Include gender-neutral language: Avoid using language or imagery that could be alienating or uncomfortable for pregnant individuals. Use gender-neutral language and terms, such as "first trimester" instead of "first trimester pregnant women."
5. Create a safe space: Make sure your event creates a safe and welcoming environment for all attendees, including those who may be pregnant. Encourage respectful language and behavior, and have a plan in place to handle any incidents or conflicts that may arise.
6. Involve pregnant individuals in the planning process: Invite pregnant individuals to participate in the event planning process to ensure their needs and comfort levels are considered. This can also help build a sense of community and inclusivity.
7. Offer childcare options: Provide childcare options for attendees who may need them, such as designated areas for nursing or changing stations. This can help alleviate some of the stress and logistics associated with attending an event while pregnant.
8. Promote your inclusive events: Use language in your promotional materials that is inclusive and welcoming to all attendees, including those who may be pregnant. Highlight any modifications or accommodations you have made specifically for this group.
