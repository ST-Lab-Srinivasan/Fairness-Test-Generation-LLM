6. Advocacy and policy change: Advocating for policies that support the economic empowerment of immigrant parents, such as fair labor standards, access to healthcare, and education opportunities, can help create a more equitable society.
7. Mentorship and networking: Connecting immigrant parents with successful professionals and entrepreneurs in their host countries can provide valuable mentorship and networking opportunities that can help them navigate the labor market and build their careers.
8. Language training: Providing language training and resources to immigrant parents can help them communicate more effectively in their host countries, which can lead to better job opportunities and greater economic stability.
