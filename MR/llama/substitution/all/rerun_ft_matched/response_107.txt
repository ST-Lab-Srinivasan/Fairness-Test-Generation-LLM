Creating more inclusive community programs for individuals with genetic conditions, particularly those from low-income backgrounds, requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various aspects of access and inequality. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Outreach and education: Develop targeted outreach programs to engage with low-income communities and provide education on genetic conditions and available resources. This can be done through community health workers, peer support groups, or local organizations that serve these populations.
