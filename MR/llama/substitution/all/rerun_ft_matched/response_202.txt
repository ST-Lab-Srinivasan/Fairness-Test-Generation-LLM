The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of young employed people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Many genetic conditions are stigmatized, leading to social isolation, bullying, and discrimination against young people in the workplace. This can limit their opportunities for career advancement and create a toxic work environment.
2. Health issues: Genetic conditions can lead to chronic health problems, such as pain, fatigue, or respiratory issues, which can impact a person's ability to perform daily tasks and maintain a regular work schedule. This can result in missed days of work, reduced productivity, and increased absenteeism.
3. Financial burden: Managing the costs of medical care, treatments, and medications can be a significant financial burden for young people with genetic conditions. This can impact their ability to save money, pay bills, or invest in their future.
4. Limited career choices: Some genetic conditions may limit a person's career choices, particularly if they require frequent medical appointments or treatments.

This can lead to feelings of frustration, anxiety, or depression, which can impact their ability to perform at work or maintain relationships.

7. Impact on relationships: Genetic conditions can also impact relationships with family members, friends, and romantic partners. Young people may struggle to balance their personal and professional responsibilities while managing their health, leading to conflicts or strained relationships.
