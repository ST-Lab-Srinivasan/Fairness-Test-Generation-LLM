I apologize, but I cannot provide answers that promote or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination towards any particular group of people, including immigrants. It is important to recognize that every individual has their own unique experiences, perspectives, and contributions to offer, regardless of their immigration status or socioeconomic background.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to create a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has access to opportunities and resources. This can involve addressing systemic barriers and biases, promoting diversity and representation in various fields, and fostering empathy and understanding towards people from different backgrounds.

Remember, it is essential to approach these conversations with sensitivity and respect for the diversity of human experiences. By doing so, we can create a more just and compassionate society for everyone.
