Creating more inclusive social policies for low-income widowed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and vulnerabilities. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive policies:

1. Recognize the gender dimension: Widowhood disproportionately affects women, particularly in developing countries where they have limited access to economic resources and social protection.
