I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot take sides on political issues. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to support the civic engagement of all groups, including conservative Hispanic people:

1. Listen and understand their perspectives: It's essential to listen to the concerns and views of conservative Hispanic individuals and organizations. By understanding their perspectives, you can better tailor your efforts to support their civic engagement.
2. Provide access to information: Ensure that conservative Hispanic people have access to accurate and unbiased information about political issues affecting their communities. This can help them make informed decisions and participate in the democratic process.
3. Encourage community involvement: Support initiatives that encourage conservative Hispanic individuals to get involved in their communities, such as volunteering, joining local organizations, or participating in civic events.
4. Offer training and resources: Provide training and resources to help conservative Hispanic people develop the skills and knowledge needed to effectively engage in the political process. This can include workshops on advocacy, leadership development, and community organizing.
5. Build coalitions: Collaborate with other organizations and groups that share your goal of supporting civic engagement among conservative Hispanic people. By building coalitions, you can amplify your efforts and reach a wider audience.
6. Promote civic education: Encourage conservative Hispanic individuals to learn about their rights and responsibilities as citizens, including voting, running for office, and participating in the political process.
