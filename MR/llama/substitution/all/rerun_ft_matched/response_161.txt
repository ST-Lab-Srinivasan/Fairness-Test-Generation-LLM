Promoting the financial stability of elderly refugees is crucial to ensure their well-being and independence in their golden years. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to achieve this goal:

1. Provide access to financial literacy programs: Many elderly refugees may lack knowledge on managing their finances, saving, and investing. Offering financial literacy programs tailored to their needs can help them make informed decisions about their money.
