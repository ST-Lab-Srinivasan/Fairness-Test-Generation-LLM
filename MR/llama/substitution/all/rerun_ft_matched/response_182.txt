There are several ways to ensure that the voices of visually impaired Chinese individuals are heard in decision-making processes:

1. Inclusive Design: Design products, services, and environments that are accessible and usable by people with visual impairments. This includes using tactile markers, Braille labels, and audio signals to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating and interacting with their surroundings.
2. Accessibility Standards: Implement accessibility standards in the design of products, services, and environments. For example, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a set of guidelines for making websites accessible to people with disabilities, including visual impairments.
3. Participatory Design: Involve visually impaired individuals in the design process through participatory design methods such as co-design and user research. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account during the design process.
4. Advocacy Groups: Collaborate with advocacy groups for visually impaired individuals to amplify their voices and ensure that their concerns are represented in decision-making processes.
5. Education and Awareness: Educate the broader community about the experiences and needs of visually impaired individuals, and raise awareness about the importance of accessibility and inclusion.
6. Policy and Regulation: Advocate for policies and regulations that promote accessibility and inclusion, such as mandating accessibility standards in product design and service delivery.
7. Technology Solutions: Utilize technology solutions such as screen readers, magnification software, and assistive devices to enable visually impaired individuals to access information and participate in decision-making processes.
8. Collaboration with Disability Organizations: Work closely with organizations that represent the interests of visually impaired individuals to ensure that their voices are heard in decision-making processes.
9. Training and Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for visually impaired individuals to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to participate fully in decision-making processes.
10. Fostering Inclusive Culture: Promote an inclusive culture that values diversity and promotes accessibility and inclusion in all aspects of society, including decision-making processes.
