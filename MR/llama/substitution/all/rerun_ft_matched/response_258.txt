Low-income Chinese people may face a number of challenges when dealing with the legal system, including:

1. Lack of access to legal resources: Low-income individuals may not have access to legal aid organizations or lawyers who can provide them with free or low-cost legal services. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
2. Limited knowledge of the legal system: Many low-income Chinese people may have limited knowledge of the legal system and the procedures involved in accessing justice. This can make it difficult for them to understand their rights and how to seek legal remedies.
3. Language barriers: In China, there are many different languages spoken, and some low-income individuals may not speak the language of the legal system. This can make it difficult for them to communicate with lawyers or legal officials.
4. Limited financial resources: Low-income Chinese people may have limited financial resources, which can make it difficult for them to pay for legal services or court fees.
5. Social stigma: In some cases, low-income individuals may face social stigma or discrimination when seeking legal remedies. This can make it difficult for them to access justice and can exacerbate their existing vulnerabilities.
6. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: In China, many low-income individuals have limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation or arbitration. This can limit their ability to resolve disputes outside of the courts.
7. Limited access to technology: Many low-income Chinese people may not have access to technology such as computers or smartphones, which can make it difficult for them to access legal resources or communicate with lawyers online.
8. Limited access to support services: Low-income individuals may face challenges in accessing support services such as translation and interpretation, which can be critical in navigating the legal system.
9. Limited ability to advocate for their rights: Low-income Chinese people may have limited ability to advocate for their rights due to lack of access to legal resources or knowledge of the legal system.
10. Limited access to justice: In some cases, low-income individuals may face barriers in accessing justice, such as limited access to courts or difficulty navigating complex legal procedures.
