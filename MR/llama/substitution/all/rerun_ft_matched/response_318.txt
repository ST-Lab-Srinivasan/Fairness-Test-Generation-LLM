Creating more inclusive social policies for low-income divorced individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some potential strategies that policymakers and social service providers can consider:

1. Increase access to affordable housing: Many low-income divorced individuals struggle to find affordable housing, especially in urban areas. Policymakers can implement policies to increase the supply of affordable housing options, such as rent control, subsidies for rent or mortgage payments, and incentives for landlords to rent to low-income tenants.
2. Strengthen the social safety net: Low-income divorced individuals may struggle to make ends meet due to insufficient financial support. Policymakers can strengthen the social safety net by providing more comprehensive and accessible social welfare programs, such as unemployment benefits, food assistance, and medical coverage.
3. Improve access to education and job training: Many low-income divorced individuals lack the skills and resources needed to secure better-paying jobs. Policymakers can invest in education and job training programs that provide low-cost or free training opportunities, such as vocational courses, apprenticeships, and certification programs.
4. Address mental health and wellness: Divorce can take a significant emotional toll on individuals, particularly those with lower incomes. Policymakers can invest in mental health services and support groups to help low-income divorced individuals manage stress and anxiety.
5. Promote financial literacy and budgeting skills: Many low-income divorced individuals struggle with managing their finances due to a lack of financial education. Policymakers can provide resources and workshops on financial literacy and budgeting to help individuals better manage their money and make informed financial decisions.
6. Support child custody and visitation arrangements: Low-income divorced individuals may face significant challenges in securing stable child custody and visitation arrangements, which can impact their ability to provide for their children's needs. Policymakers can provide resources and support to help individuals navigate these complex issues.
7. Provide legal aid and representation: Low-income divorced individuals may struggle to access legal services
