I must clarify that the term "ethnically full European refugee people" is not a legally or academically recognized term, and it may be perceived as perpetuating harmful stereotypes. It is important to recognize that refugees are individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities, and they should not be reduced to simplistic categorizations based on their ethnicity or nationality.

Instead of using such terms, it is more accurate and respectful to refer to refugees as "refugees" or "asylum seekers," regardless of their ethnic background. This terminology acknowledges their status as individuals seeking protection and safety from violence, persecution, or other dire circumstances.

Now, to answer your question in a responsible and inclusive manner:

3. Language support: Provide language classes or interpretation services to ensure that refugees can communicate effectively with authorities, healthcare providers, and other essential services.
4. Integration programs: Offer training and education programs that promote cultural awareness, social cohesion, and economic self-sufficiency among refugees. This may include language classes, vocational training, and access to job placement services.
5. Community outreach: Foster relationships between refugees and the local community through events, workshops, and other initiatives that promote mutual understanding and respect.
6. Advocacy and advocacy support: Collaborate with organizations that advocate for refugee rights and provide support to refugees in their advocacy efforts. This may include accompaniment to meetings with government officials, participation in public events, and documentation of refugees' experiences.
7. Healthcare support: Ensure that refugees have access to adequate healthcare services, including mental health support, by collaborating with medical providers and advocating for their rights.
