Regarding the challenges faced by native Canadian speakers in the legal system, there are several issues that have been identified by scholars and community members:

1. Language barriers: Many native Canadian communities have limited access to legal services due to language barriers. The legal system is often conducted in English or French, which can create obstacles for individuals who speak indigenous languages or have limited proficiency in the dominant languages.
