Supporting ethnically diverse communities, particularly those in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, requires a culturally sensitive approach that acknowledges and respects the unique needs and experiences of each community. Here are some effective strategies for supporting not-in-third-trimester Asian communities:

1. Culturally responsive care: Provide care that is grounded in an understanding of the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of the community.
