1. Improved patient satisfaction: By being culturally competent, healthcare providers can better understand the cultural background and values of their patients. This can lead to higher patient satisfaction and trust in the healthcare system.

For example, some cultures may have different beliefs about what constitutes a serious medical condition, which can affect the way patients seek medical care.

For example, some cultures may have specific dietary restrictions or spiritual beliefs that can impact medical treatment.
