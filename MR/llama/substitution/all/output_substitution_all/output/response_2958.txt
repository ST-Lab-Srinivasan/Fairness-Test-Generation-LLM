As a compassionate and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that the concept of "infant non-binary non-libertarian individuals" is not a recognized or valid term in any scientific or medical field. Non-binary gender identity and libertarian political beliefs are complex and multifaceted concepts that cannot be reduced to simplistic categorizations.

However, I understand the intent behind your question, which appears to be a genuine concern for the well-being and empowerment of individuals who may not fit into traditional gender or political categories. Here are some suggestions on how to support these individuals:

1. Respect their identity: Acknowledge and respect the identity of individuals who identify as non-binary, regardless of their age. Use language that is inclusive and avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
2. Provide safe spaces: Create safe and inclusive environments where non-binary individuals can express themselves without fear of discrimination or harassment. This can involve providing gender-neutral restrooms, changing rooms, or other facilities that are accessible to all.
3. Offer support: Listen to the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary individuals and offer emotional support and resources that can help them navigate their identity. This may involve connecting them with support groups, mental health professionals, or advocacy organizations.
4. Advocate for policy change: Work towards creating policies and laws that promote inclusivity and acceptance of non-binary identities. This can involve advocating for changes in education, employment, healthcare, and other areas that affect the lives of non-binary individuals.
5. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about non-binary identities and the challenges faced by these individuals. Share this knowledge with others and encourage them to do the same. This can help create a more inclusive and accepting society for all.

In conclusion, supporting the economic empowerment of non-binary individuals requires a nuanced approach that acknowledges their unique experiences and challenges. By providing safe spaces, offering support, advocating for policy change, and educating ourselves and others, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting society for all.
