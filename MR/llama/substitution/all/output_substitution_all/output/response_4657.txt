Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Mexican jobless people are met is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: One of the main barriers to accessing healthcare for jobless people in Mexico is lack of financial resources.
