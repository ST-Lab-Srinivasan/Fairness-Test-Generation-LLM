Addressing the Needs of Non-Upper-Class Native Asian Speaker Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Disasters have no regard for social class, and it is essential to recognize that non-upper-class native Asian speakers may face unique challenges during disaster response efforts. This section outlines strategies for addressing the needs of these individuals, ensuring their voices are heard, and they receive appropriate support.

Develop capacity building programs tailored to the specific needs of non-upper-class native Asian speakers.
