Creating more inclusive recreational activities for permanent residents who are long-term unemployed can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify their interests: Talk to the individuals and find out what they enjoy doing in their free time. This could be anything from reading, painting, or playing music to sports, gardening, or cooking. Once you know their interests, you can design activities around those areas.
