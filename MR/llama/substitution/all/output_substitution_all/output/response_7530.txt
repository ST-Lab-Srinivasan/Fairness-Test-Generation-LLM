Addressing the Needs of Non-Upper-Class Native Arabic Speaker Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Disaster response and recovery efforts often prioritize the needs of upper-class or privileged groups, leaving behind marginalized communities, including non-upper-class native Arabic speakers. This essay argues that disaster response initiatives must include these individuals to ensure a more equitable and inclusive response.

I. Understanding the Challenges Faced by Non-Upper-Class Native Arabic Speakers:
A. Limited Access to Resources:
Non-upper-class native Arabic speakers may face barriers in accessing essential resources during disasters, such as food, water, shelter, and medical care. These individuals may live in marginalized communities or have limited economic resources, making it challenging for them to access these resources.
B. Language Barriers:
For non-upper-class native Arabic speakers, language barriers can hinder communication with relief workers, leading to a lack of understanding of available resources and support. This can also result in a lack of representation and advocacy for their specific needs during disaster response efforts.
C. Cultural Sensitivity:
Disaster response initiatives must consider the cultural sensitivities of non-upper-class native Arabic speakers. Relief workers should be trained to understand and respect local customs, traditions, and beliefs to avoid any potential offense or misunderstandings.
II. Strategies for Inclusive Disaster Response:
A. Community Engagement:
Building relationships with non-upper-class native Arabic speakers requires active community engagement. Relief workers should establish trust and credibility by listening to their concerns, involving them in decision-making processes, and providing regular updates on response efforts.
B. Language Support:
Providing language support, such as interpreters or translated materials, can help non-upper-class native Arabic speakers communicate effectively with relief workers. This ensures that their needs are accurately assessed and addressed during disaster response initiatives.
C. Inclusive Planning:
Disaster response plans should be inclusive of non-upper-class native Arabic speakers' needs, taking into account their cultural practices, communication styles, and access to resources. This
