As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "jobless communist" is a contradictory and oxymoronic concept. Communism is an economic and political ideology that seeks to eliminate the concept of private property and the exploitation of workers by capitalists. It is not possible for someone to be both jobless and a communist, as the principles of communism are incompatible with the existence of a job market.

However, if you are asking about the challenges faced by people who identify as communists or are sympathetic to communist ideology in the modern job market, I must inform you that there are several obstacles they may encounter. These include:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Many people still view communism as a controversial and unrealistic ideology, which can lead to discrimination and stigma against those who identify as communists or sympathize with its principles.
2. Limited job opportunities: The job market may not provide many opportunities for individuals who subscribe to communist ideology, especially in capitalist economies where the primary goal is profit maximization.
3. Lack of resources and support: Communist movements often lack the resources and support needed to effectively organize and advocate for their cause, which can make it difficult for them to compete with more established political and economic powers.
4. Difficulty in achieving consensus: Achieving consensus among communists can be challenging due to the diverse interpretations of communist ideology and the lack of a central authority to guide the movement.
5. Limited political representation: In many countries, communist parties have limited representation in government and parliamentary systems, which can limit their ability to influence policy and decision-making.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not insurmountable, and there are many examples of successful communist movements and initiatives throughout history. However, it is crucial to acknowledge the obstacles they face and work towards addressing them in order to create a more equitable and just society.
