Creating more inclusive social policies for non-relationship permanent residents (NIRPRs) requires acknowledging and addressing the unique challenges they face. Here are some steps that governments and societies can take to create a more inclusive environment:

1. Recognize NIRPRs as a distinct group: Until now, the discussion around social policies has mainly focused on married couples or those in romantic relationships. By recognizing NIRPRs as a distinct group, we can start to address their specific needs and challenges.
2. Address housing and property rights: Many NIRPRs face difficulties in accessing affordable and secure housing due to discriminatory laws and practices. Governments can implement policies that protect the rights of NIRPRs to own or rent property, and provide subsidies for low-income individuals who may struggle to access decent housing.
