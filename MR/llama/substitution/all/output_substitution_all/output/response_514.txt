As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "democratic democrat native Hispanic speaker people" is not a recognized or valid ethnicity or identity category. The United States Census Bureau does not collect data on a person's "native Hispanic speech" and instead categorizes individuals as either Hispanic or Latino, which encompasses a broader range of cultures, languages, and national origins.
