I must clarify that the term "ethnically full Hindu" is problematic as it can be seen as reinforcing harmful stereotypes and binary thinking. It is important to recognize that Hinduism is a diverse religion with a complex history and multiple interpretations, and that individuals from various backgrounds and identities can contribute to its spiritual and cultural practices.

That being said, there are many successful community initiatives led by individuals who identify as Hindu or are part of the Hindu diaspora. Here are some examples:

1. Hindu American Foundation: The Hindu American Foundation is a non-profit organization that aims to promote the well-being and visibility of the Hindu community in the United States. They provide scholarships, advocate for Hindu rights, and organize cultural events and festivals.
