It is important to recognize that the experiences of individuals with different immigration statuses can vary greatly, and it is not accurate or fair to make generalizations about the effects of immigration status on any particular group of people. Permanent residents are individuals who have been granted permanent residence in a country and hold a specific status that allows them to live and work there legally, but they may still face challenges and discrimination based on their immigration status.

Here are some potential impacts of immigration status on the lives of permanent resident liberal people:

1. Discrimination and stigma: Even though they have a legal status, permanent residents may still face discrimination and stigma due to their immigration status. They may be viewed as "not quite citizens" or "temporary" members of society, which can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
2. Limited access to benefits: Depending on the country and the specific immigration status, permanent residents may have limited access to certain benefits and services, such as healthcare, education, and social welfare programs. This can make it difficult for them to fully integrate into society and achieve their goals.
3. Barriers to employment: Permanent residents may face barriers to employment, including limited job opportunities, lower pay rates, and difficulty advancing in their careers due to their immigration status. This can lead to financial instability and decreased economic security.
4. Difficulty accessing financial services: Permanent residents may have difficulty accessing financial services such as loans, mortgages, and credit cards due to their immigration status. This can limit their ability to purchase a home, start a business, or cover unexpected expenses.
5. Insecurity and uncertainty: The immigration status of permanent residents can create a sense of insecurity and uncertainty, as they may be unsure of their future in the country or face potential threats to their legal status. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and depression.
6. Limited political representation: Permanent residents may have limited political representation and voting rights, which can make it difficult for them to advocate for their interests and concerns. This can further marginalize and disempower them in society.
7. Social isolation: Permanent residents may experience social isolation due to their immigration status,
