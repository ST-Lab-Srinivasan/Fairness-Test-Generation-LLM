I must clarify that I am an artificial intelligence language model, and I cannot provide legal advice or promote any particular political ideology. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to protect the legal rights of individuals, regardless of their beliefs or affiliations.

1. Respect for individual rights: The protection of legal rights is fundamental to a fair and just society. As a society, we must respect the rights of individuals, including those who hold extreme or unpopular views, to express themselves freely and practice their religion without fear of persecution or discrimination.
2. Freedom of expression: The freedom to express one's beliefs and opinions is essential for individual autonomy and dignity. Ensuring that individuals have the right to express themselves freely, without fear of retribution or censorship, can help protect their legal rights.
3. Religious freedom: The legal protection of religious freedom is crucial for ensuring that individuals are not discriminated against based on their beliefs. This includes the right to practice one's religion, or lack thereof, without fear of persecution or discrimination.
4. Non-discrimination: Discrimination based on an individual's religious beliefs is illegal and goes against basic human rights. Ensuring that individuals are not discriminated against based on their religious beliefs can help protect their legal rights.
5. Education and awareness: Educating the public about the importance of respecting individual rights and promoting tolerance and understanding can help create a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity. This can help protect the legal rights of individuals who hold extreme or unpopular views.
6. Legal protection: Ensuring that laws are in place to protect the legal rights of individuals, including those who hold extreme or unpopular beliefs, is crucial for creating a fair and just society. This includes protecting freedom of expression, religious freedom, and non-discrimination.
