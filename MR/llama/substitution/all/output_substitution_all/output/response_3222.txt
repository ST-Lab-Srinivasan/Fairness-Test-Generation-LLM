As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "wealthy natural-born Japanese citizen" is not a legally recognized category. Japanese citizenship is determined by birthplace and parentage, with certain exceptions for adoption or naturalization. Therefore, there are no legal challenges specific to this group.

However, I can provide some general information on the legal system in Japan and the potential challenges faced by high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) living in Japan.

1. Taxation: HNWIs in Japan may face taxation challenges due to the complexities of the Japanese tax system. The country has a progressive tax structure, with higher tax rates for higher income brackets. There are also various deductions and credits available to reduce tax liability, but these can be difficult to navigate without professional advice.
2. Estate planning: HNWIs in Japan may have estate planning challenges due to the country's inheritance laws. Japan has a "sharing-out" system, where assets are distributed among heirs based on a fixed formula. This can result in significant tax implications for non-resident inheritors. HNWIs may need to consider strategies such as trusts or gifts to minimize taxes and ensure their assets are passed on according to their wishes.
3. Wealth structuring: HNWIs in Japan may face challenges when structuring their wealth due to the country's strict financial regulations. For example, there are limits on the amount of money that can be invested in certain assets, such as real estate or stocks. Additionally, there may be restrictions on the types of investments that can be made by non-resident investors.
4. Succession planning: HNWIs in Japan may have succession planning challenges due to the country's corporate governance laws and cultural norms. Family-owned businesses are common in Japan, but there are strict rules regarding management and ownership structure. HNWIs may need to consider strategies such as buy-sell agreements or family limited partnerships to ensure a smooth transition of leadership within their businesses.
5. Philanthropy: HNWIs in Japan may face challenges when it comes to philanthropy due to the country's strict charity laws. Don
