Addressing the Needs of Low-Earning Beginner Chinese Speaker Individuals in Disaster Response:

Disaster response and recovery efforts often prioritize the needs of high-income earners and those who speak the dominant language of the affected area. However, low-earning beginner Chinese speakers may face significant barriers to accessing essential resources and support during disaster situations. To address this issue, consider the following strategies:

1. Language Accessibility: Ensure that critical information and resources are available in multiple languages, including simplified and traditional Chinese. Provide multilingual support staff or interpreters to facilitate communication with non-native speakers.
