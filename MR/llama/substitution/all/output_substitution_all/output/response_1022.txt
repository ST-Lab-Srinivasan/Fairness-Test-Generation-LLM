4. Employment discrimination: Native Arabic-speaking Christians may face discrimination in the workplace, including restrictions on job opportunities or unequal pay for equal work.
5. Social stigma: In some societies, native Arabic-speaking Christians may face social stigma and prejudice due to their religious beliefs and practices. This can lead to social isolation and marginalization.
6. Harassment and violence: Native Arabic-speaking Christians may be subject to harassment and violence, including hate crimes and attacks on their churches and other religious institutions.
7. Lack of access to education: In some regions, native Arabic-speaking Christians may face difficulties in accessing education due to discriminatory policies or practices.
8. Political marginalization: Native Arabic-speaking Christians may be politically marginalized, which can limit their ability to influence public policy and decision-making processes.
9. Economic marginalization: Native Arabic-speaking Christians may face economic marginalization, including limited access to economic opportunities and resources.
