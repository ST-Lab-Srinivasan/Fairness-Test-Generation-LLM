Supporting the economic empowerment of ethnic minority groups in Nigeria, particularly those living in poverty, is crucial for reducing inequality and promoting sustainable development. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to support the economic empowerment of these groups:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many ethnic minority groups in Nigeria lack access to financial services such as bank accounts, loans, and insurance. Governments and financial institutions should work together to provide financial inclusion programs that target these groups, enabling them to access financial services and build their credit history.
2. Skills Development: Providing skills development opportunities can help ethnic minority groups acquire the necessary skills to compete in the job market. This can include vocational training, entrepreneurship training, and technical skills training.
3. Entrepreneurship Support: Encouraging entrepreneurship among ethnic minority groups can help create jobs and generate income. Governments and organizations should provide support to these groups through mentorship programs, access to capital, and networking opportunities.
4. Access to Markets: Many ethnic minority groups in Nigeria face challenges accessing markets and customers for their products. Governments and private sector actors can work together to create market opportunities and facilitate access to consumers.
5. Affirmative Action Policies: Implementing affirmative action policies can help address the historical marginalization of ethnic minority groups in Nigeria. These policies can include reservations in government contracts, scholarships, and job placements.
6. Community Development Programs: Community development programs can help build social capital among ethnic minority groups, enabling them to access resources and opportunities more easily.
7. Addressing Discrimination: Discrimination against ethnic minority groups in Nigeria can hinder their economic empowerment. Addressing this discrimination through policies and programs that promote equal opportunities and non-discrimination can help level the playing field.
8. Promoting Cultural Preservation: Many ethnic minority groups in Nigeria have unique cultural practices and traditions. Promoting cultural preservation can help these groups maintain their identity and cultural heritage, which can also contribute to economic empowerment.
9. Collaboration with Civil Society
