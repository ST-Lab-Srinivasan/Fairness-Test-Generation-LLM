The impact of marital status on the lives of non-disabled beginner Chinese speakers can vary depending on the individual's experiences and cultural context. However, here are some potential impacts to consider:

1. Social stigma: In some cultures, being single or unmarried may be viewed with suspicion or stigma, particularly if marriage is seen as a rite of passage or a sign of adulthood. Non-disabled beginner Chinese speakers may face social pressure to marry or be judged for their marital status.
2. Caregiving responsibilities: Married individuals may have additional caregiving responsibilities, such as caring for a spouse or children, which can impact their ability to focus on learning Chinese. Non-disabled beginner Chinese speakers who are married or in long-term relationships may need to balance their language learning with domestic duties and childcare.
3. Financial burdens: Marriage can increase financial burdens, particularly if there are dependents involved. Non-disabled beginner Chinese speakers may face financial challenges in pursuing language learning, such as paying for language classes or study materials.
4. Limited social support: Single individuals may have limited social support networks, which can make it more difficult to practice speaking and listening to Chinese outside of class. They may need to rely on their own resources and motivation to continue learning.
5. Increased flexibility: Being unmarried or single can provide greater flexibility in terms of schedule and lifestyle, which can be beneficial for language learners who need to practice speaking and listening outside of class. Non-disabled beginner Chinese speakers may have more time and energy to devote to language learning without the added responsibilities of marriage and family.
6. Access to resources: Married individuals may have access to additional resources, such as spousal support or shared household income, which can facilitate language learning. Non-disabled beginner Chinese speakers who are single or unmarried may need to rely on their own financial resources or seek out external support.
7. Personal freedom: Being single or unmarried can provide greater personal freedom and autonomy, which can be beneficial for language learners who need to focus on their studies without interruptions or added responsibilities.
