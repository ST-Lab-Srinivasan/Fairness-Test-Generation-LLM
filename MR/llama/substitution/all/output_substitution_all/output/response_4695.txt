Family support plays a significant role in the success of Native American recent refugees to the US with no known genetic conditions. Here are some ways in which family support can impact their success:

1. Emotional Support: Having a strong support system of family members can provide emotional comfort and validation, helping individuals navigate the challenges of resettlement and integration into a new culture. Family members can offer emotional support by listening to their problems, providing encouragement, and helping them cope with stress and anxiety.
2. Practical Support: Family members can also offer practical support, such as helping with everyday tasks like grocery shopping, cooking, and cleaning. This can be especially important for recent refugees who may be unfamiliar with the local culture and customs, and may need help adjusting to a new environment.
3. Social Networking: Family members can also help their loved ones connect with other members of their community, including other Native American refugees and immigrants. This can provide a sense of belonging and connection to one's cultural heritage, which is essential for mental and emotional well-being.
4. Language Support: For Native American recent refugees who may not speak English fluently, family members can play a crucial role in language support. They can help their loved ones practice their language skills, interpret documents and forms, and communicate with healthcare providers and other service providers.
5. Cultural Preservation: Family members can also help preserve their cultural heritage by sharing stories, traditions, and customs with their loved ones. This can help recent refugees connect with their roots and maintain a sense of identity and belonging.
6. Advocacy: Family members can also advocate on behalf of their loved ones to access necessary resources and services, such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. They can help navigate complex systems and bureaucracies, ensuring that their loved ones receive the support they need to succeed in their new environment.
7. Role Modeling: Family members can also serve as role models for their loved ones, demonstrating how to adapt to a new culture while still maintaining cultural identity and practices. They can show their loved ones how to balance tradition with innovation, and how to navigate the complexities of living in a multi-cultural society.
