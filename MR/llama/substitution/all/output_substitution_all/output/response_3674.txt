This can include including literature, art, and other cultural productions that reflect the experiences of non-binary and genderqueer individuals.
2. Provide support services: Offer support services such as counseling, academic advising, and mentorship programs to help students navigate the educational system and succeed academically. These services can be particularly important for students who may face additional barriers due to their gender identity or socioeconomic status.

4. Encourage self-expression: Encourage students to express themselves authentically through various forms of expression, such as art, music, or writing. This can help students develop their identities and build confidence in their self-expression.
5. Address systemic barriers: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and national levels to address systemic barriers that may impact the educational outcomes of non-binary and genderqueer students.
