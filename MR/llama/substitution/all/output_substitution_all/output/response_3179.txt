Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of non-disabled natural-born South American citizens. Here are some possible effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Depending on the political leanings of the government in power, access to healthcare may be affected. For example, if a left-leaning government is in office, they may prioritize universal healthcare and make it more accessible to citizens.
