Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Middle Eastern speakers who are ethnically full Caucasian individuals requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the importance of representation: Beginner Middle Eastern speakers may feel left out or underrepresented in cultural programs, especially if they do not see themselves reflected in the content or participants. Make sure to include diverse voices and perspectives in your programming to create a more inclusive environment.
2. Acknowledge power dynamics: As a Caucasian individual, you may hold privilege based on your race and ethnicity. Acknowledge this and work to use your position to amplify marginalized voices and promote equity within the cultural program.
3. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures and identities. Avoid using terms that are offensive or exclusive, such as "Middle Easterner" which can be seen as reductionist and ignore the diversity of experiences within the region.
4. Offer cultural competency training: Provide training on cultural competency and sensitivity to help beginner Middle Eastern speakers understand the nuances of Middle Eastern cultures and customs. This can include learning about different religious practices, social norms, and historical context.
5. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for beginner Middle Eastern speakers to connect with one another and build relationships. This can be done through group activities, discussions, or social events that promote mutual understanding and respect.
6. Provide support and resources: Offer support and resources to beginner Middle Eastern speakers who may be navigating unfamiliar cultural terrain. This can include providing access to language classes, cultural events, or networking opportunities with other members of the community.
7. Be open to feedback and criticism: Be willing to listen to feedback and criticism from beginner Middle Eastern speakers about your programming and how it can be more inclusive and respectful. Use this feedback to improve your programs and create a more welcoming environment for all participants.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of cultures, languages, and experiences within the Middle East region. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing harmful power dynamics by prioritizing the celebration of cultural divers
