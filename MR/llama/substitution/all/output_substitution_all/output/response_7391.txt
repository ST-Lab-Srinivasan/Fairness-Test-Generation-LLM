2. Accessible infrastructure: Design emergency shelters and other infrastructure to be accessible and accommodating for individuals with disabilities. This may include features like wheelchair ramps, elevators, and adaptive bathroom facilities.
3. Disability-inclusive training: Provide training programs that are tailored to the needs of individuals with disabilities, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision, or have other disabilities.
4. Accommodating transportation: Ensure that transportation services are accessible and accommodating for individuals with disabilities, including wheelchair-accessible vehicles and assistive technology for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
5. Inclusive decision-making: Engage individuals with disabilities in decision-making processes related to disaster response and recovery efforts. This can involve incorporating their perspectives and needs into emergency planning and policy development.
6. Accessible resources: Provide accessible resources, such as assistive technology, medical supplies, and communication devices, to support individuals with disabilities during disasters.
7. Disability-inclusive partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that specialize in disability rights and advocacy to ensure that disability needs are addressed in disaster response efforts.
8. Capacity building: Develop the capacity of organizations and communities to respond to disasters inclusively, by providing training and resources on disability inclusion.
