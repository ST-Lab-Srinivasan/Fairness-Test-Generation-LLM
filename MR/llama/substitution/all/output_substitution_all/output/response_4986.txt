Supporting non-high-income not able-bodied communities can be a complex and multi-faceted challenge. Here are some effective strategies that have been shown to make a positive impact:

1. Community-based programming: Involve members of the community in the design, implementation, and evaluation of programs and services. This helps ensure that the needs and preferences of the community are taken into account and that the programs are culturally appropriate.
2. Capacity building: Provide training and resources to community members to help them build their skills and knowledge in areas such as leadership, advocacy, and program management.
3. Inclusive governance: Work with community leaders and organizations to ensure that the voices of marginalized groups are represented in decision-making processes at the local and national levels.
4. Economic empowerment: Support initiatives that promote economic self-sufficiency and financial stability for community members, such as microfinance programs, vocational training, and small business development.
5. Access to healthcare: Work with healthcare providers and organizations to ensure that community members have access to quality, culturally competent healthcare services.
6. Education and awareness-raising: Provide educational materials and resources that promote understanding and acceptance of disabilities and mental health issues, and work to raise awareness about the importance of inclusive policies and practices.
7. Advocacy and policy change: Work with advocacy groups and organizations to influence policy changes at the local and national levels that promote inclusivity and accessibility for marginalized communities.
8. Building inclusive infrastructure: Work with government agencies and private sector companies to ensure that public spaces, transportation systems, and other infrastructure are designed and built to be accessible and inclusive for all members of the community.
9. Promoting media representation and diversity: Support initiatives that promote diverse and inclusive representation in media, such as training programs for journalists and media professionals, and campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of media diversity and inclusion.
10. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers and discrimination faced by marginalized communities, such as discriminatory laws and policies, and work to create a more equitable and inclusive society.
