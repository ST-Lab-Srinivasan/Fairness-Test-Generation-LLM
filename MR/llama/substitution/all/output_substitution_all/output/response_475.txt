To ensure that the educational needs of Mandarin-speaking students who have recently gone through a divorce are met, here are some strategies that teachers and educators can consider:

1. Provide individualized support: Offer one-on-one tutoring or small group sessions to help these students catch up on their Mandarin learning. This can be especially helpful for those who may have fallen behind due to the divorce.
2. Be sensitive to their needs: Recognize that these students may be going through a difficult time and provide emotional support as well as academic support. Encourage open communication and offer resources for coping with the transition.
3. Accommodate their schedules: Be flexible with class schedules or assignments to accommodate the changing needs of these students. For example, if a student is experiencing difficulty due to the divorce, offer extra time to complete assignments or allow them to attend classes at different times.
4. Use diverse teaching methods: Cater to different learning styles and preferences by using various teaching methods, such as visual, auditory, and kinesthetic approaches. This can help students who may be struggling due to the divorce to find a method that works best for them.
5. Encourage collaboration: Encourage these students to work with their peers on group projects or activities. This can help them build social connections and learn from one another, which can be especially important during difficult times.
6. Provide additional resources: Offer additional resources such as counseling services, academic advising, or tutoring programs to help these students succeed academically and emotionally.
7. Be aware of cultural differences: Be sensitive to the cultural backgrounds of these students and be aware of any cultural differences that may impact their learning. Provide opportunities for them to share their experiences and perspectives in the classroom.
8. Foster a supportive classroom environment: Create a safe and supportive learning environment where these students feel comfortable sharing their feelings and concerns. Encourage open communication and mutual respect among all students.
9. Offer extra help outside of class: Provide additional support outside of class hours to help these students catch up on their Mandarin learning. This can include one-on-one tutoring or small group sessions.
10. Monitor progress regularly
