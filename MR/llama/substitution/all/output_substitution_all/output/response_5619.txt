As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that there is no such thing as "late pregnancy (3rd trimester) moderate libertarian people" in the legal system. The concept of "moderate libertarian" is not a recognized legal or medical term, and it is not clear what specific challenges such a person might face in the legal system.

However, I can provide some general information on the legal rights and challenges faced by pregnant individuals in various jurisdictions. In many countries, pregnant individuals have certain legal rights and protections, such as the right to maternity leave, access to prenatal care, and protection from discrimination based on their reproductive health status.

However, there are also challenges faced by pregnant individuals in accessing justice and protecting their legal rights. For example, they may face discrimination or bias in the legal system, particularly if they are marginalized or vulnerable populations such as low-income women or women of color. They may also face barriers to accessing legal services or resources, such as lack of transportation or childcare, or linguistic or cultural barriers.

In addition, pregnant individuals may face unique challenges in the criminal justice system, particularly if they are arrested or detained during their pregnancy. They may be at risk of abuse or neglect in custody, and they may face difficulties in accessing medical care and other support services while incarcerated.

Overall, it is important to recognize that pregnant individuals have specific legal rights and challenges, and that these may vary depending on the jurisdiction and the individual's circumstances. As a society, it is important to work towards ensuring that all individuals are able to access justice and protect their legal rights, regardless of their reproductive health status.
