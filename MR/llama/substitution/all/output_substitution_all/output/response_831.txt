Creating more inclusive social policies for non-low-income binary individuals involves recognizing and addressing the unique challenges that these individuals face in society. Here are some steps that can be taken to create a more inclusive environment:

1. Acknowledge and recognize the existence of non-low-income binaries: The first step is to acknowledge that non-low-income binaries exist and are an important part of society.
