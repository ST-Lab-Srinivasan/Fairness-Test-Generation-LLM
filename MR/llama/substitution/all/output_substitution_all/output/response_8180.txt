The legal system in the United States can be complex and challenging for recent refugees, especially those who are just above the poverty line. Some of the specific challenges they may face include:

1. Lack of knowledge about US laws and regulations: Refugees may have limited understanding of the US legal system and its procedures, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the system and access their rights.
2. Language barriers: Many refugees may not speak English fluently, which can hinder their ability to communicate with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Refugees may have limited financial resources, which can make it difficult for them to afford legal representation or access legal aid organizations.
4. Cultural barriers: Refugees may come from different cultural backgrounds and may have different expectations and beliefs about the legal system. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications with legal professionals.
5. Trauma and stress: Many refugees have experienced trauma and stress related to their flight from violence, persecution, or natural disasters. This can affect their mental health and ability to navigate the legal system.
6. Difficulty navigating the asylum process: Refugees who are seeking asylum in the US may face challenges in navigating the complex and often lengthy asylum process, including interviews with immigration officials and court hearings.
7. Discrimination and bias: Refugees may experience discrimination or bias from legal professionals, which can affect their ability to access justice.
8. Limited access to social services: Refugees may have limited access to social services, such as healthcare and education, which can make it difficult for them to establish a stable life in the US.
9. Difficulty finding employment: Refugees may face challenges in finding employment due to language barriers, lack of work experience, or discrimination based on their immigration status.
