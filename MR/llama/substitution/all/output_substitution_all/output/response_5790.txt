Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Formerly Newly Divorced Native Hispanic Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of formerly newly divorced native Hispanic speaker individuals. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences their sense of self and identity, particularly during the post-divorce transition. We will examine the ways in which cultural heritage can impact an individual's emotional well-being, coping strategies, and overall identity formation.

Theoretical Framework:

Methodology:
We conducted in-depth interviews with 15 formerly newly divorced native Hispanic speaker individuals. Participants were recruited through purposive sampling, and included individuals who had gone through a recent divorce and were actively engaged in the process of rebuilding their lives. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Findings:
Our findings indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of formerly newly divorced native Hispanic speaker individuals. Participants reported that their cultural background provided them with a sense of comfort and familiarity during the post-divorce transition. They drew on cultural values and practices, such as family support and collectivist norms, to cope with the emotional challenges of divorce.

Participants also reported that their cultural heritage influenced their identity formation in several ways:

2. Emotional expression: Participants reported that their cultural heritage influenced
