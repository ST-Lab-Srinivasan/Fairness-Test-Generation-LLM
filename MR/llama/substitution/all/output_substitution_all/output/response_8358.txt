Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and integration of Native American recent refugees into the US, particularly for those who are over the age of 65 (and therefore considered "elderly" or "senior"). Here are some ways mentorship can support their development:

1. Cultural preservation and transmission: Many Native American elderly individuals have experienced cultural disruption and loss due to forced relocation, cultural suppression, or other historical traumas.
