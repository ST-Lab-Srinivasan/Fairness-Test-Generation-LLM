It is important to ensure that the voices of beginner Caribbean speakers, including those who are ethnically full Italian, are heard in decision-making processes. Here are some strategies that can be employed to achieve this:

1. Create a platform for their voices to be heard: This can be done by providing opportunities for them to participate in discussions and decision-making processes, either through formal or informal channels. For example, beginner Caribbean speakers could be invited to attend community meetings or events where decisions are being made, or they could be asked to provide input through surveys or focus groups.
2. Build trust and rapport: It is important to build trust and rapport with beginner Caribbean speakers in order to create a safe and supportive environment for them to share their voices. This can be done by spending time with them, listening to their concerns and needs, and showing respect and empathy towards them.
3. Provide cultural competency training: Many beginner Caribbean speakers may not be familiar with the dominant culture and decision-making processes in their new community. Providing cultural competency training can help them understand these processes and feel more comfortable participating in them.
4. Use interpreters or translators: For those who are not fluent in the dominant language, using interpreters or translators can help ensure that their voices are heard and their opinions are represented.
5. Foster a sense of belonging: It is important to create a sense of belonging among beginner Caribbean speakers, so they feel valued and included in their new community. This can be done by providing opportunities for them to connect with others who share similar experiences and backgrounds, and by acknowledging and celebrating their unique perspectives and contributions.
6. Address power imbalances: Beginner Caribbean speakers may face power imbalances in decision-making processes due to systemic barriers such as racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination. Addressing these power imbalances through policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion can help ensure that their voices are heard and their opinions are respected.
7. Create a supportive environment: Creating a supportive environment where beginner Caribbean speakers feel comfortable sharing their voices and perspectives is crucial for ensuring that they are heard in decision-making
