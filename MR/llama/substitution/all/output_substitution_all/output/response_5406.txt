Creating more inclusive community events for Native Chinese speakers, especially those who are advanced in age (over 85), requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make these events more accessible and enjoyable for this demographic:

1. Use clear and simple language: Avoid using complex vocabulary or jargon that may be difficult for older adults to understand. Use clear and concise language when communicating event details, programs, and other important information.
2. Provide accessible seating: Ensure that there is adequate seating available with proper back support and armrests. Consider designating specific areas for people with mobility issues or providing extra seating options, such as cushioned chairs or benches.
3. Offer assistive listening devices: Provide amplified sound systems or assistive listening devices, such as headphones or earpieces, to help older adults hear the event more clearly.
4. Use visual aids: Use visual aids, such as projectors or large screens, to display important information and content. This can help older adults who may have difficulty hearing or reading.
5. Schedule events during daytime hours: Older adults may find it easier to participate in community events during daytime hours when they are more alert and energized. Avoid scheduling events too close to bedtime or at times that may be challenging for them to attend.
6. Provide transportation options: Offer transportation services or arrange carpooling options to help older adults get to the event location. This can be especially helpful for those who may have difficulty driving or using public transportation.
7. Incorporate activities that promote socialization and engagement: Older adults often benefit from social interaction and mental stimulation. Consider incorporating activities that encourage conversation, creativity, or learning, such as group games, craft sessions, or educational workshops.
8. Offer health and wellness resources: Provide information on local healthcare services, nutrition advice, or fitness programs that cater to the needs of older adults. This can help them maintain their physical and mental well-being, which is essential for overall quality of life.
9. Create a comfortable and welcoming environment: Ensure that the event space is warm, comfortable
