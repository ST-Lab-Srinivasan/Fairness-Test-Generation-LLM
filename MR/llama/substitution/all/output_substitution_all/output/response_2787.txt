Creating more inclusive social policies for average earners who are not in a relationship requires understanding their unique challenges and addressing the systemic barriers that limit their access to support. Here are some strategies for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the existence of non-traditional families: Recognize that families come in diverse forms, including single-parent households, blended families, and LGBTQ+ families. Ensure that policies are designed to support all family structures, regardless of their configuration.
2. Address income inequality: Develop policies that aim to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, such as progressive taxation, living wage laws, and social safety nets. This can help ensure that average earners have access to a decent standard of living.
3. Provide affordable housing options: Ensure that there are adequate and affordable housing options available for single individuals, particularly in areas with high demand and limited supply. This can involve investing in affordable housing programs, incentivizing developers to include affordable units in new construction projects, and implementing rent control measures.
4. Encourage education and job training: Offer training and educational programs that cater to the needs of average earners, particularly those who may not have access to higher education or vocational training. This can help individuals acquire new skills and increase their earning potential.
5. Support mental health and well-being: Provide resources and support for mental health and wellness, including counseling services, stress management programs, and access to healthy living spaces. This can help average earners manage the emotional challenges of living alone and maintain good mental health.
6. Foster community connections: Encourage social connections and a sense of community among single individuals by providing opportunities for volunteering, group activities, and social events. This can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation.
7. Advocate for flexible work arrangements: Encourage employers to offer flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or part-time schedules, to accommodate the needs of single individuals who may have childcare or other responsibilities.
8. Improve access to healthcare: Ensure that single individuals have access to affordable and quality healthcare, including preventive services, mental health support
