Cultural exchange plays a significant role in fostering understanding between native English speaker refugee, recent temporary visa holder to the US, and other groups. Here are some ways cultural exchange can promote understanding:

1. Shared experiences: Refugees and temporary visa holders bring their unique experiences and perspectives to their new host country. By sharing these experiences through cultural exchange programs, they can connect with others and build bridges of understanding.

Through cultural exchange programs, participants can experience the customs, traditions, and values of their host country, which can help them better understand the perspectives of native English speaker groups.

8. Educational programs: Offering educational programs that teach about the cultures, histories, and traditions of refugee and temporary visa holder communities can help promote understanding and empathy. These programs can
