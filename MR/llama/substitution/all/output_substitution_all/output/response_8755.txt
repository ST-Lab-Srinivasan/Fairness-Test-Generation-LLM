Meeting the educational needs of beginner Spanish speaker non-citizen individuals can be challenging, but there are several strategies and approaches that can help ensure their success. Here are some recommendations:

1. Provide Access to Quality Language Instruction: Non-citizens often face barriers in accessing quality language instruction due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area. Organizations can offer scholarships, grants, or free classes specifically designed for non-citizens to help overcome these obstacles.
2. Adapt Learning Materials and Methods: Language learning materials and methods should be tailored to the needs and levels of beginner Spanish speaker non-citizens. This may involve using simpler language and vocabulary, providing visual aids, and offering practical examples that are relevant to their lives.
3. Foster an Inclusive Learning Environment: Creating an inclusive learning environment is crucial for non-citizens who may feel marginalized or isolated due to their immigration status. Teachers can use strategies such as peer-to-peer learning, group activities, and cultural events to promote interaction and mutual understanding among students.

5. Encourage Community Engagement: Integrating non-citizens into the broader community can help them feel more connected and invested in their language learning journey. Organizations can organize events or activities that bring together native speakers and non-citizens, such as cultural festivals, volunteer opportunities, or language exchange programs.

Online resources, language learning apps, and virtual classrooms can help bridge this gap and provide more flexible and accessible learning opportunities.
7. Foster Cross-Cultural Understanding: Language learning is not just about mastering grammar and vocabulary but also about understanding the cultural context of the language. Organizations can incorporate cultural events, workshops, or discussions into their programming to help non
