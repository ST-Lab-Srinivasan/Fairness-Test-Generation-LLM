Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of employed conservative people, particularly those who hold anti-immigrant views. Here are some potential effects:

1. Fear of Discrimination: Employed conservatives may fear discrimination in the workplace due to their political beliefs. They may worry that their colleagues or supervisors will view them unfavorably if they express anti-immigrant opinions, leading to a toxic work environment.
2. Increased Isolationation: Employed conservatives may feel isolated or excluded from social and professional networks due to their immigration status. They may struggle to connect with colleagues who hold different political views or feel uncomfortable discussing sensitive topics at work.
3. Stigma Attachment: People with anti-immigrant views may internalize the stigma associated with their position, leading to feelings of shame or guilt. This can affect their mental health and self-esteem, particularly if they feel that their beliefs are not acceptable in their professional setting.
4. Difficulty Advocating for Immigrants: Employed conservatives may find it challenging to advocate for the rights of immigrants, as their political views could be seen as contradictory. They may worry about losing credibility or facing backlash from colleagues if they speak out in support of immigration reform.
5. Career Consequences: Employed conservatives may worry that their political beliefs will harm their career prospects. They may fear being passed over for promotions or facing discrimination during performance evaluations.
6. Difficulty Balancing Work and Personal Life: The stress of navigating a politically charged work environment can spill over into personal life, affecting an employed conservative's relationships, hobbies, and overall well-being.
7. Internalized Oppression: Employed conservatives may internalize the oppression they experience due to their political beliefs, leading to feelings of powerlessness or hopelessness. This can affect their mental health and overall quality of life.
8. Lack of Diversity and Inclusion: The presence of employed conservatives in a workplace can create a lack of diversity and inclusion, particularly if they are the only person with anti-immigrant views
