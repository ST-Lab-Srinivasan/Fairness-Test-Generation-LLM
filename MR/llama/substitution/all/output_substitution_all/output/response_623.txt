As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must acknowledge that the term "cisgender infant non-binary" is not a recognized or valid medical or psychological term. It is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.

Instead, I suggest using terms such as "infant non-binary" or "non-binary infant" to refer to individuals who do not identify as male or female, and are still in the process of exploring and discovering their gender identity. It is important to recognize that gender identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity, and it is crucial to respect and support individuals in their journey towards self-discovery and self-expression.

In terms of supporting social inclusion of non-binary individuals, here are some ways to create a more inclusive environment:

1. Use gender-neutral language and avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
2. Provide options for gender-neutral pronouns, such as "they/them" or "ze/hir," and respect people's preferences regarding how they want to be referred to.
3. Create inclusive spaces by using gender-neutral language in signage, labels, and other communications.
4. Support non-binary individuals in advocating for their rights and protections, such as legal recognition of their gender identity and access to gender-affirming healthcare.
5. Educate oneself and others about the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary individuals, and work towards breaking down barriers and discrimination that may exist in society.

Remember, every person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their gender identity or expression. By creating a more inclusive environment, we can help ensure that non-binary individuals feel valued, supported, and included in our communities.
