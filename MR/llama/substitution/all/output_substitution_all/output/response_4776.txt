Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native natural-born US citizen secular Muslim individuals. As a result of their ancestry, these individuals have inherited a complex and multifaceted identity that is rooted in both Islamic culture and American society. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage shapes their identities:

1. Religious identity: As secular Muslims, these individuals may struggle with the tension between their religious beliefs and their American identity. They may feel pressure to conform to societal expectations of what it means to be an American, while also maintaining their religious practices and beliefs. Their cultural heritage influences their understanding of Islam and how they practice it in a non-Muslim majority society.
2. Cultural traditions: Native natural-born US citizen secular Muslim individuals may experience a sense of belonging to both their Muslim community and the larger American society. They may observe both Islamic cultural traditions, such as fasting during Ramadan or celebrating Eid al-Fitr, and American cultural traditions, such as observing Thanksgiving or Fourth of July holidays. This duality can create a sense of identity that is both inclusive and exclusive.
3. Language and communication: As members of a minority group within the US, these individuals may experience language barriers in their interactions with non-Muslim Americans. They may also face discrimination or misunderstandings due to cultural differences. Their cultural heritage influences how they communicate and express themselves, both within their Muslim community and outside of it.
4. Food and cuisine: The food culture of Native natural-born US citizen secular Muslim individuals is likely to be shaped by both Islamic dietary restrictions and American culinary traditions. They may observe halal food practices while also enjoying American fast food or other cultural cuisines. This fusion of culinary influences can contribute to a unique identity that blends religious and cultural practices.
5. Family and community: The family and community dynamics of Native natural-born US citizen secular Muslim individuals are likely to be shaped by both Islamic values and American social norms. They may experience tensions between the expectations of their Muslim community and the broader society, while also navigating their own personal beliefs and practices.
