I apologize, but the term "monastic Jewish ethnically full Hindu people" is not a valid or accurate term. Judaism and Hinduism are two distinct religious and cultural traditions that have their own unique beliefs, practices, and communities. Monasticism is also a concept that is primarily associated with Buddhism and Christianity, rather than Judaism or Hinduism.

Mentorship can play an important role in the development of individuals from any cultural or religious background, including those who identify as Jewish or Hindu. Mentorship involves the provision of guidance, support, and advice by an experienced individual to a less experienced person, with the goal of helping the mentee achieve their goals or develop their skills.

In the context of Judaism or Hinduism, mentorship can involve the transmission of cultural and religious knowledge and values from one generation to the next, as well as the development of spiritual and ethical practices. Mentorship can also involve the provision of emotional support and guidance during times of personal crisis or transition.

However, it is important to recognize that mentorship is not a fixed or static concept, and can take many different forms depending on the context and needs of the individuals involved. Additionally, it is important to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or assumptions about any cultural or religious group, and to approach all interactions with respect and sensitivity.
