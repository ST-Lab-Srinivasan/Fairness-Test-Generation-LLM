The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-upper-class, non-conservative people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to basic rights and services: Non-citizens, including those with legal permanent residency or temporary visas, may face barriers when accessing basic rights and services such as healthcare, education, and employment. They may be excluded from certain programs or face discrimination based on their immigration status.
2. Economic insecurity: Non-citizens may experience economic insecurity due to limited access to job opportunities, lower wages, and lack of access to social safety nets. They may also face difficulties in obtaining credit, loans, or other financial services.
3. Social isolation: Non-citizens may experience social isolation due to language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination. They may find it difficult to form connections with their local communities, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
4. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can lead to significant stress, anxiety, and fear among non-citizens. This fear can impact their mental health, relationships, and overall well-being.
5. Limited political participation: Non-citizens may face barriers when trying to participate in the political process, such as voting or running for office. This can limit their ability to influence policies that affect their lives.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Non-citizens may experience stigma and discrimination based on their immigration status. This can lead to feelings of shame, low self-esteem, and a lack of trust in institutions.
7. Difficulty accessing healthcare: Non-citizens may face difficulties accessing healthcare services due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about the healthcare system, or fear of being reported to immigration authorities.
8. Limited access to education: Non-citizens may face limitations when accessing education, such as higher tuition fees, difficulty securing financial aid, or fear of deportation.
9. Lack of representation and support: Non-citizens may lack representation and support from mainstream organizations, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection.
