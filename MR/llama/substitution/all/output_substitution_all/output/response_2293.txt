Native Arabic speakers who are recent undocumented immigrants to the US may face a range of challenges in the legal system. Here are some potential issues they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Arabic is a non-English language, and many legal documents and proceedings are conducted in English. This can create a significant barrier for native Arabic speakers who may have difficulty understanding legal terminology or participating in court hearings.
