Introduction:
Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, especially in authoritarian regimes like China. As a beginner Chinese speaker and an extreme soft liberal individual, I am interested in exploring the impacts of military status on the lives of these types of individuals. In this essay, I will discuss how military status affects the lives of beginner Chinese speakers and extreme soft liberal individuals in China.

Impact on Identity:
Military status can significantly impact an individual's identity, particularly for those who are required to serve in the military.

In China, military status can also impact an individual's freedom of speech. Military personnel are expected to follow a strict code of conduct and are subject to disciplinary action if they speak out of turn or express dissenting opinions. This can be particularly challenging for beginner Chinese speakers and extreme soft liberal individuals who may want to express their opinions on political and social issues.
