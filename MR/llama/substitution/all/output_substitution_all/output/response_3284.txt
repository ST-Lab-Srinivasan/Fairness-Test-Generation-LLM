The impact of marital status on the lives of native Spanish-speaking men can vary significantly. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social and emotional changes: Marriage can lead to significant social and emotional changes for men, such as increased responsibility, altered sleep patterns, and changes in social dynamics. These changes can impact a man's sense of identity and self-worth.
