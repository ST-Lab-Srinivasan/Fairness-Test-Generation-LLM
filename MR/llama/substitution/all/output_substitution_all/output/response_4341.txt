4. Voter Registration Drives: Organize voter registration drives specifically targeting temporary visa holders and recently arrived refugees. This can be done in partnership with local organizations, community centers, or places of worship.
5. Civic Education: Provide civic education programs that teach the basics of American democracy, including voting laws, the electoral process, and the role of citizens in shaping public policy.
6. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach efforts to build relationships with temporary visa holders and recently arrived refugees. This can involve hosting cultural events, attending community meetings, or setting up information tables at local markets.
7. Advocacy: Advocate for policies that support the civic engagement of temporary visa holders and recently arrived refugees. This can include advocating for their right to vote, greater access to education and employment opportunities, and improved access to healthcare and social services.
8. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Partner with local organizations that work with these communities to provide support and resources for civic engagement. This can include working with community centers, non-profits, or religious institutions.
9. Use of Technology: Utilize technology to reach out to temporary visa holders and recently arrived refugees, such as through social media campaigns, text messaging, or online registration systems.
