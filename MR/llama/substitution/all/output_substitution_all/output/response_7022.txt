3. Limited access to legal resources: Newly arrived immigrants may have limited access to legal resources such as affordable legal representation, interpreter services, and cultural sensitivity training for legal professionals.
4. Difficulty gathering evidence: Individuals who are seeking permanent residency may face challenges in gathering the necessary evidence to support their application, including documents related to their immigration history, employment, education, and other aspects of their life in the United States.

7. Limited understanding of immigration options: Newly arrived immigrants may not be aware of all the immigration options available to them, including alternatives to permanent residency such as temporary visas or asylum status.
8. Difficulty navigating the US court system: Individuals who are seeking permanent residency may face challenges in navigating the US court system, including understanding the different types of courts and their jurisdictions, as well as the legal requirements for filing a lawsuit or appealing a decision.
