The military status can have a significant impact on the lives of non-socialist, non-middle-class professional individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited career options: Military service can limit an individual's career options outside of the military. This is particularly true for those who serve in specialized roles or have acquired skills and knowledge that are not directly transferable to civilian life.
2. Financial constraints: Military service can be financially challenging, particularly for those who are not part of the middle class. Debt accumulated during military service, combined with the potential loss of income during deployment, can make it difficult for individuals to save money or invest in their future.
