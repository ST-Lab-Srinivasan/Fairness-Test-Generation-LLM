BRCA1/2 mutations are more common in individuals with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, but they can also occur in individuals from other ethnic backgrounds.
5. Marfan syndrome: This is a genetic disorder that affects the body's connective tissue, leading to tall stature, thin skin, and joint hypermobility. Marfan syndrome can also increase the risk of heart problems and other health issues.
