I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality, including cultural diversity. All individuals, regardless of their ethnic background, should be treated with dignity and respect, and have equal opportunities to enrich their lives.

Cultural diversity can play a significant role in enriching the lives of people from any background by exposing them to different perspectives, beliefs, and practices. It can help break down barriers and promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity. However, it is important to recognize that cultural diversity alone cannot solve the complex issues of unemployment and economic inequality faced by many Middle Eastern communities.

To address these issues, it is essential to provide access to education, job training, and economic opportunities that can help individuals acquire new skills and knowledge, and improve their socio-economic status. This may involve investing in infrastructure, promoting entrepreneurship, and creating jobs in various industries.

Moreover, it is crucial to address the systemic barriers and discrimination that have historically hindered the economic progress of marginalized communities. This includes advocating for policies that promote equity and inclusion, such as affirmative action, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and anti-discrimination laws.

In conclusion, cultural diversity can play a role in enriching the lives of ethnically diverse Middle Eastern communities by promoting understanding and empathy. However, addressing issues of unemployment and economic inequality requires a comprehensive approach that includes access to education, job training, and policy changes that promote equity and inclusion.
