Addressing the Specific Needs of Ethnically Diverse Long-Time Divorced Individuals in College Graduate Programs: A Case Study Approach

Introduction:
Ethnic diversity among college students has been on the rise in recent years, with an increasing number of students identifying as non-white or multiracial. However, there is a lack of research on the specific needs and experiences of ethnically diverse long-time divorced individuals in higher education, particularly in graduate programs. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring the specific needs and challenges faced by such individuals in college graduate programs.

 Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that ethnic diversity among college students can have a positive impact on academic performance and social integration (Hounts, 2017). However, there is limited research on the specific needs and experiences of long-time divorced individuals in higher education, particularly those from diverse ethnic backgrounds. A qualitative case study approach was used to explore the experiences of ethnically diverse long-time divorced individuals in college graduate programs.

 Methodology:
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 ethnically diverse long-time divorced individuals enrolled in college graduate programs. The participants were selected using purposive sampling to ensure diversity in terms of ethnicity, gender, age, and marital status. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed thematically using an inductive approach.

 Findings:
The findings highlight several specific needs and challenges faced by ethnically diverse long-time divorced individuals in college graduate programs, including:

1. Lack of support services: Participants reported a lack of support services tailored to their unique needs as long-time divorced individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds. They expressed a need for counseling services specifically designed to address the emotional challenges of divorce and ethnic identity.
2. Social isolation: Many participants experienced social isolation due to their lack of connection with peers who shared their cultural background and experiences. This led to feelings of disconnection from their academic environment.
3. Stigma and discrimination: Participants reported experiencing stigma and discrimination based on their ethnic identity
