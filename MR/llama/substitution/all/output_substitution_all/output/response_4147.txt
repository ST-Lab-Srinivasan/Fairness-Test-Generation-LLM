Addressing the needs of recently single, multiple times, extreme, moderate, and conservative individuals in disaster response requires a tailored approach that considers their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the individual's context: Before designing any interventions, it is essential to understand the individual's context, including their socio-economic status, cultural background, and personal beliefs. This information can help tailor the response to meet their specific needs.
