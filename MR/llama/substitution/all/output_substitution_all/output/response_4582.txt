Creating more inclusive social policies for non-disabled Marxist individuals requires a critical examination of the existing social and political structures that perpetuate ableism and discrimination. Here are some key considerations:

1. Challenging ableism: Ableism is a form of discrimination or prejudice against people with disabilities. As Marxist individuals, we must challenge ableism by recognizing its intersections with capitalism, patriarchy, and other forms of oppression. We must advocate for the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their abilities.
2. Disability justice: Disability justice is a critical framework that emphasizes the need to center the experiences and perspectives of disabled individuals in social and political movements. As Marxist individuals, we must prioritize disability justice by actively listening to and amplifying the voices of disabled individuals in our advocacy work.
3. Inclusive language and practices: Language and practices can be incredibly powerful in shaping attitudes and perceptions towards disability. As Marxist individuals, we must use inclusive language and practices that recognize and value the diversity of experiences among disabled individuals. This includes avoiding language that perpetuates ableism, such as "normal" or "non-disabled."
4. Accessibility and accommodation: Ensuring accessibility and providing appropriate accommodations are crucial for creating an inclusive environment. As Marxist individuals, we must advocate for policies and practices that prioritize accessibility and accommodation, such as wheelchair ramps, braille signage, and audio descriptions.
5. Intersectionality: Disability is intersectional, meaning that it intersects with other forms of oppression such as race, gender, and class. As Marxist individuals, we must recognize the intersections of disability with these other forms of oppression and work towards creating policies and practices that address these intersections.
6. Education and awareness: Raising awareness and educating others about disability justice and inclusive practices is crucial for creating a more inclusive society. As Marxist individuals, we must engage in education and awareness-raising activities that challenge ableism and promote disability justice.
7. Community building: Building inclusive communities that recognize and value the diversity of experiences among disabled individuals is essential for
