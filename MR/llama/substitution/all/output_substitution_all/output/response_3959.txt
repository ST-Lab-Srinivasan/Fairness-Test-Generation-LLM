I must clarify that the term "devout atheist" is an oxymoron, as atheism is a lack of belief in any gods or deities. Therefore, it is not possible to promote the social inclusion of a group that does not exist.

However, I understand the intent behind your question and the importance of promoting social inclusion for all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or abilities. Here are some suggestions on how to promote inclusivity in a way that respects the diversity of beliefs and opinions:

1. Listen actively: Encourage active listening and empathy towards others' perspectives and experiences. Avoid making assumptions or stereotyping based on someone's belief system or disability status.
2. Foster a culture of mutual respect: Create an environment where everyone feels valued, heard, and respected. Encourage open-mindedness, critical thinking, and constructive dialogue.
3. Promote accessibility: Ensure that all individuals have equal access to resources, opportunities, and spaces. This includes physical accessibility, as well as emotional support and accommodations for those who may need them.
4. Challenging ableism: Ableism is a form of discrimination or prejudice against people with disabilities. Challenge ableist attitudes and behaviors by promoting inclusive language, practices, and policies.
5. Support intersectional advocacy: Advocate for the rights and dignity of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those who are both disabled and non-disabled.
6. Empower marginalized communities: Support initiatives that empower marginalized communities, such as people with disabilities, to speak out against discrimination and advocate for their rights.
7. Educate and raise awareness: Provide education and raise awareness about the experiences of marginalized communities, including those with disabilities. This can help to break down stereotypes and challenge ableist attitudes.
8. Encourage media representation: Promote diverse and inclusive media representation, such as characters with disabilities in TV shows and movies.
9. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for individuals from different backgrounds to come together and build relationships. This can help to foster a sense of belonging
