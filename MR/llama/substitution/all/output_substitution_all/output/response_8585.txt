As a beginner Chinese speaker and a recent Green Card holder in the US, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system:

1. Language Barrier: The legal system in the US can be complex and difficult to navigate for non-native speakers, especially if you are not fluent in English. You may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documents, which could lead to misunderstandings or mistakes.
2. Cultural Differences: The legal system in the US is based on common law, which can be quite different from the legal systems in other countries, such as China. Understanding the cultural nuances and expectations of the legal system in the US can be challenging for foreigners.
3. Lack of Knowledge: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may not have a comprehensive understanding of the legal system in the US, including its laws, regulations, and procedures. This lack of knowledge can lead to confusion and mistakes when dealing with legal issues.
4. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Depending on where you live in the US, you may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, and libraries. This can make it difficult for you to research and understand your legal rights and obligations.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is a history of discrimination against immigrants and non-English speakers in the US legal system. You may face barriers such as language discrimination or biases from court officials, lawyers, or other legal professionals.
6. Difficulty Navigating the Court System: The court system in the US can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for non-native speakers. You may struggle to understand the different levels of courts, the roles of judges and lawyers, and the procedures involved in legal cases.
7. Limited Access to Legal Representation: Depending on your income level or immigration status, you may have limited access to legal representation. This can make it difficult for you to navigate the legal system and protect your rights.
8. Cultural Shock: Moving to a new country can be culturally shocking, especially if you are not used to the legal system in the US. You may feel overwhelmed by the different laws, customs, and expectations of the legal system.
