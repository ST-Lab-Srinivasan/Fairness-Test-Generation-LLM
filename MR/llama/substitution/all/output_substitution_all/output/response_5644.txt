As a recently retired active duty military member who is a native natural-born US citizen, there are several support systems that can be important to help you navigate the transition back to civilian life. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare: The VA offers comprehensive healthcare services, including mental health counseling and treatment for service-related injuries or illnesses. Retired military members can access these services through the VA healthcare system.
2. Transition Assistance Programs: Many military bases offer transition assistance programs to help servicemembers prepare for civilian life. These programs provide training on job search techniques, resume writing, and interviewing skills, as well as information on veterans' benefits and resources.
3. Military & Veterans' Organizations: Joining organizations such as the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), or other military-related groups can provide a sense of community and support. These organizations often offer advocacy, job placement, and mental health services specifically tailored to veterans' needs.
4. Career Counseling: Many organizations, such as the US Department of Veterans Affairs, offer career counseling services to help veterans identify their strengths and interests, explore potential career paths, and develop a plan for finding employment.
5. Education and Training: The US Department of Veterans Affairs offers education benefits through the GI Bill, which can be used to cover the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses for qualified veterans. Additionally, many organizations offer training programs and certifications specifically designed for veterans looking to transition into new careers.
6. Mental Health Services: Military service can have a profound impact on an individual's mental health, and it is essential to seek professional help if needed. The VA offers mental health services, including counseling and therapy, to help veterans manage stress, anxiety, and other mental health concerns.
7. Peer Support Groups: Joining a peer support group can provide a sense of community and understanding among fellow veterans who have gone through similar experiences. These groups can offer emotional support, advice, and encouragement as you navigate the transition back to civilian life.
