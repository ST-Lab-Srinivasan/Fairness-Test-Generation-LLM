Financially disadvantaged Mexican people may face several challenges when navigating the legal system, including:

1. Lack of access to legal representation: Many financially disadvantaged Mexicans may not be able to afford legal representation, which can limit their ability to access justice and defend their rights.
2. Limited knowledge of the legal system: Financially disadvantaged individuals may lack the resources and information necessary to navigate the complexities of the legal system, making it difficult for them to understand their rights and responsibilities.
3. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against financially disadvantaged individuals can be prevalent in the legal system, which can result in unequal treatment and outcomes.
4. Limited access to legal resources: Financially disadvantaged individuals may have limited access to legal resources such as libraries, online databases, and other tools that can help them research and prepare their cases.
5. Language barriers: For those who are not fluent in Spanish, the legal system can be particularly challenging as many documents and proceedings are only available in this language.
6. Limited mobility: Financially disadvantaged individuals may have limited mobility due to a lack of transportation or resources, which can make it difficult for them to attend court hearings or meet with legal representatives.
7. Lack of trust in the system: Financially disadvantaged individuals may feel that the legal system is not designed to support them, leading to a lack of trust and motivation to engage with the system.
8. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Financially disadvantaged individuals may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation or arbitration, which can be more cost-effective and efficient than going to court.
9. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system may not be culturally competent in addressing the needs of financially disadvantaged individuals from diverse backgrounds, leading to a lack of understanding and empathy for their unique experiences.
10. Limited access to legal aid organizations: Financially disadvantaged individuals may have limited access to legal aid organizations that can provide them with free or low-cost legal services, which can be crucial in helping them navigate the legal system.
