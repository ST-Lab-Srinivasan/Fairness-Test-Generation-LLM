Listen to their perspectives and involve them in the decision-making process when designing cultural programs.
2. Challenge ableism: Ableism is a form of discrimination or prejudice against people with disabilities. Challenge ableism by promoting inclusive language, images, and behaviors that respect and value diversity.
3. Foster inclusive environments: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
