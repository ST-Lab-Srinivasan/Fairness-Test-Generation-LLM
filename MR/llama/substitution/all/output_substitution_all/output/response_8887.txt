I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality, including the idea of prioritizing the financial needs of a specific racial or ethnic group over others. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve equal access to resources and opportunities.

It is important to recognize that the financial needs of any individual or community are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to a single factor such as race or ethnicity. Factors such as education, job opportunities, housing, healthcare, and social support networks can all play a role in determining an individual's financial stability and well-being.

Instead of focusing on racial or ethnic categories, it is more productive to work towards creating a fair and equitable society where everyone has access to the resources and opportunities they need to thrive. This can involve addressing systemic inequalities and working to dismantle structures of oppression that perpetuate inequality.

In short, ensuring that the financial needs of any group of people are met requires a commitment to equity and justice, rather than discrimination or favoritism based on race or ethnicity.
