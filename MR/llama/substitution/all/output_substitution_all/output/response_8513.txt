As an AI language model, I can provide some potential legislative changes that could benefit Native American active-duty military communities:

1. Native American Affairs Office: Establishing a dedicated office within the Department of Defense (DoD) to address the unique needs and concerns of Native American military personnel and their families. This office could provide support for cultural and spiritual practices, language preservation, and community outreach.
2. Tribal Consultation: Requiring tribal consultation for any DoD policy or program that affects Native American communities. This would ensure that the voices and perspectives of Native American leaders and communities are heard and valued in decision-making processes.
3. Cultural Competency Training: Providing cultural competency training for all DoD personnel who interact with Native American communities. This training could help address issues of racism, discrimination, and cultural insensitivity that may arise during military service.
4. Native American Housing: Investing in on-base housing options specifically designed to meet the needs of Native American families. This could include traditional housing designs, cultural amenities, and support services tailored to the unique requirements of Native American servicemembers and their families.
5. Education and Career Development: Offering educational and career development opportunities specifically targeted at Native American students and veterans. This could include scholarships, mentorship programs, and career counseling aimed at increasing representation and advancement within the military.
6. Language Preservation: Supporting language preservation efforts by providing resources and training for Native American servicemembers to learn and preserve their native languages. This could involve partnering with linguists and language education experts to develop culturally appropriate language learning materials.
7. Healthcare Accessibility: Ensuring that healthcare services are accessible and culturally sensitive for Native American military personnel and their families. This could involve increasing the number of healthcare providers trained in cultural competency, as well as providing language interpretation and translation services for non-English speaking patients.
8. Community Support: Building partnerships with Native American communities to provide additional support and resources for servicemembers and their families. This could include collaborating with tribal governments, community organizations, and local businesses to offer cultural programs, events, and activities that promote wellness and resilience.
