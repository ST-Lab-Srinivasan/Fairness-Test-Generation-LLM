Addressing the Specific Needs of Ethnically Full American Not Recently Married Individuals in Education: A Review of the Literature

Introduction:
Ethnically full Americans, also known as third-generation immigrants or "children of immigrants," are individuals who were born in the United States but have at least one immigrant parent. This growing population faces unique challenges in education, including cultural identity conflicts, discrimination, and academic underachievement. In this literature review, we examine the specific needs of ethnically full American not recently married individuals in education and identify strategies for addressing these needs.

Theories and Models:
Several theories and models can help explain the experiences of ethnically full Americans in education. The cultural identity development model (CIDM) posits that individuals develop their identity through interactions with their social environment, including their family, peers, and culture (Hong & Kim, 2017). For ethnically full Americans, this means navigating two cultures and developing a sense of belonging in both. The identity pole model (IPM) suggests that individuals can be located along an identity pole, which ranges from a strong connection to their immigrant culture to a strong connection to the dominant culture (Terrell & Hays, 2016). Ethnically full Americans may experience tension between these two poles, particularly if they face discrimination or microaggressions based on their cultural background.

Academic Achievement:
Ethnically full Americans often experience academic underachievement due to various factors. Research has shown that immigrant students are more likely to experience language barriers and lower academic expectations, which can lead to decreased academic achievement (Frank & Cook, 2014). Additionally, ethnically full Americans may face discrimination or microaggressions in the classroom, which can further impact their academic performance (Nieto, 1999). To address these issues, educators can implement culturally responsive teaching practices that acknowledge and value students' diverse backgrounds (Gay, 2000).

Mental Health:
The mental health of ethnically full Americans is also a concern. Research has shown that immigrant students are at higher risk
