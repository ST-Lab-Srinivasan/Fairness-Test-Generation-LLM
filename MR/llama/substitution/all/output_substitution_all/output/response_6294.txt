Creating more inclusive public policies for non-disabled ethnic minorities in South America requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the intersecting forms of discrimination and marginalization faced by these groups. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Data collection and analysis: Collect data on the socioeconomic status, education levels, and health outcomes of ethnic minorities to identify disparities and areas where policies need to be targeted.
2. Consultation and participation: Involve ethnic minority communities in the policy-making process through consultations and participatory mechanisms. This can help ensure that policies are responsive to their needs and priorities.
3. Anti-discrimination laws: Enact and enforce anti-discrimination laws that protect ethnic minorities from discrimination in education, employment, housing, and other areas of life.
