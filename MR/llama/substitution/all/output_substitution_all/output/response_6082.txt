As a legal aid worker, I have encountered several challenges faced by natural-born Asian citizen people who are just above the poverty line in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of access to legal resources: Many individuals from low-income families struggle to access legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and legal aid services. This can lead to a disadvantage in navigating the legal system, particularly for those who are not familiar with the legal process.
2. Limited knowledge of legal rights: Many individuals may be unaware of their legal rights and options, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively. This is particularly true for those who have limited access to legal resources and education.
3. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist in many legal systems, particularly against marginalized communities such as people of color, women, and LGBTQ+ individuals. These challenges can make it difficult for individuals to access justice and fair treatment under the law.
4. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of their country or region, navigating the legal system can be particularly challenging.
