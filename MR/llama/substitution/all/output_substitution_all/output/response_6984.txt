The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of over 90 years old active-duty people can be significant and far-reaching. As people age, their bodies undergo natural changes that can increase the risk of developing genetic disorders. These conditions can affect various aspects of an older person's life, including their physical health, mental well-being, social relationships, and overall quality of life. Here are some potential impacts of genetic conditions on elderly active-duty people:

1. Physical limitations: Genetic conditions can cause a range of physical symptoms that can limit an older person's ability to perform daily tasks, maintain their independence, and participate in activities they enjoy. For example, muscular dystrophy can lead to progressive muscle weakness and loss of mobility, while neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's can cause cognitive decline and difficulty with communication and coordination.
2. Chronic illness: Many genetic conditions are chronic and require ongoing medical attention. This can lead to a significant burden on the individual's healthcare system, as well as their caregivers and family members. For example, individuals with Huntington's disease may require frequent hospitalizations and medical procedures, which can be emotionally taxing for both the patient and their loved ones.
3. Financial strain: Managing a genetic condition can be costly, particularly if the individual requires ongoing medical care, therapies, or assistive devices. This can lead to financial stress and difficulty affording basic needs like housing, food, and healthcare.
4. Social isolation: Genetic conditions can impact an older person's social relationships and interactions. For example, individuals with Friedreich's ataxia may experience progressive loss of mobility, which can limit their ability to participate in social activities or visit with friends and family.
5. Mental health concerns: Living with a genetic condition can lead to emotional distress, anxiety, and depression, particularly if the individual experiences stigma or discrimination due to their condition. This can impact their mental health and overall quality of life.
6. Impact on caregivers: Genetic conditions can also have an impact on the individuals' caregivers, who may experience emot
