Lower-income natural-born South American citizen people may face a range of challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Lower-income individuals may not have access to legal representation or other resources that can help them navigate the legal system. This can make it difficult for them to understand their rights and responsibilities under the law.
2. Language barriers: In some South American countries, indigenous languages may be spoken by a significant portion of the population, which can create language barriers within the legal system.
3. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The legal system may not always be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of lower-income individuals, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the law.
4. Discrimination: Lower-income individuals may face discrimination within the legal system due to their socio-economic status, which can result in unequal treatment under the law.
5. Limited access to justice: Lower-income individuals may have limited access to justice due to a range of factors, including lack of resources, lack of knowledge about the legal system, and discrimination.
6. Limited capacity to advocate for themselves: Lower-income individuals may not have the skills or resources to effectively advocate for their rights within the legal system.
7. Difficulty navigating complex laws and procedures: The legal system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are unfamiliar with it. This can lead to difficulties in accessing justice and resolving legal issues.
8. Limited access to legal aid: Legal aid organizations may not have the resources or infrastructure to provide adequate support to lower-income individuals, making it difficult for them to access legal services.
9. Limited awareness of legal rights: Lower-income individuals may be unaware of their legal rights and responsibilities, which can lead to difficulties in accessing justice.
10. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms: Lower-income individuals may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such as mediation or arbitration, which can make it difficult for them to resolve legal disputes.

It's worth noting that these challenges are not unique to South America and can be found in many other regions around the world. Address
