Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Arabic speaker undocumented recent refugees to the US requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach that takes into account their unique experiences, challenges, and cultural background. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for program staff and volunteers to help them understand the diverse needs and experiences of refugees from different cultures. This can include learning about the cultural norms, values, and beliefs of native Arabic speakers and how they may differ from those in the US.
2. Community outreach: Engage in community outreach and outreach to local Arabic-speaking refugee communities to raise awareness about available programs and services. This can be done through door-to-door canvassing, flyers, posters, or social media campaigns in the local refugee community language(s).
3. Language support: Provide language support services such as Arabic translation and interpretation to ensure that all program materials and communication are accessible to native Arabic speakers. This can include providing Arabic-speaking staff and interpreters for cultural events, workshops, and programs.
4. Inclusive programming: Develop programming that is inclusive of refugees' diverse cultural backgrounds and experiences. For example, hosting cultural events and activities that reflect the diverse traditions and practices of native Arabic speakers, such as food festivals, music performances, or traditional craft-making workshops.
5. Mental health support: Provide mental health support services tailored to the specific needs of refugees from different cultures. This can include counseling and psychotherapy services in Arabic, as well as cultural sensitivity training for mental health professionals to better serve this population.
6. Collaboration with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve refugee communities to reach a wider audience and provide more comprehensive support. This can include partnering with community centers, mosques, or other organizations that serve Arabic-speaking refugees.
7. Community arts projects: Develop community arts projects that allow refugees to express themselves through art, music, or other creative mediums. This can help foster a sense of community and cultural identity among participants while also providing an outlet for emotional expression and healing
