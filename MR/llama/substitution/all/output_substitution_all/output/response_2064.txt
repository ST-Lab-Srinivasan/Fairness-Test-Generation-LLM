As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that the military community is a diverse group of individuals with different needs, experiences, and backgrounds. Therefore, any legislative changes should be designed to benefit all members of the military community, regardless of their native language proficiency. That being said, here are some potential legislative changes that could benefit native Chinese speaker active duty military communities:

1. Language Training Support: Provide additional resources and support for language training programs that cater to native Chinese speakers, including courses on grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. This could help military members improve their proficiency in English or other languages spoken within the military community.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offer cultural sensitivity training sessions that focus on the customs, traditions, and values of Chinese culture. This could help military members better understand and appreciate the cultural differences within the military community and avoid unintentional offenses.
3. Language Accessibility: Ensure that all military documents, forms, and other materials are available in multiple languages, including Chinese. This could help native Chinese speakers access important information without facing language barriers.
4. Tutoring Programs: Establish tutoring programs that pair native Chinese speakers with experienced tutors who can provide one-on-one language instruction and support. This could help military members improve their language skills more effectively.
5. Language Proficiency Testing: Develop and implement language proficiency testing standards that are tailored to the needs of native Chinese speakers. This could help identify areas where these individuals need improvement and provide a fair evaluation of their language abilities.
6. Multilingual Communication Support: Provide additional support for military members who communicate with each other in multiple languages, such as Chinese, English, and Spanish. This could involve offering translation services or providing language interpretation training to help military members communicate more effectively across linguistic barriers.
7. Cross-Cultural Training: Offer cross-cultural training programs that focus on the customs, traditions, and values of different cultures within the military community. This could help native Chinese speakers better understand and appreciate the cultural differences within the military community and avoid unintentional offenses.
8. Language Resources: Provide access to language learning resources, such as language learning apps, podcasts, and online
