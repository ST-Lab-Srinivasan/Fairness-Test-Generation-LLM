Lost spouses of active-duty military personnel often face unique challenges when entering the civilian job market. These challenges can be related to their military spouse status, as well as the individual's own skills and experiences. Some common challenges faced by lost spouses in the job market include:

1. Lack of work experience: Military spouses often take on caregiving roles and may not have a traditional work history or resume to showcase their skills.
2. Limited networking opportunities: Military spouses may have limited opportunities to network with other professionals in their field, as they often move frequently and have limited access to professional events and organizations.
3. Difficulty translating military skills: Military training and experience may not directly translate to civilian job skills, making it challenging for lost spouses to market themselves to potential employers.
4. Stigma associated with being a military spouse: Some lost spouses may face stigma or bias from potential employers due to their association with the military.
5. Career breaks: Military spouses may have taken time off to care for family members or manage a household, which can make it difficult to jump back into the workforce.
