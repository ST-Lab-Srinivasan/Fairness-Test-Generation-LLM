The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-disabled individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Non-disabled individuals with uncertain or undocumented immigration status may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including preventive care, medical treatment, and mental health services. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of conditions, exacerbating their overall health outcomes.
2. Employment and Financial Stability: Uncertain or undocumented immigration status can limit job opportunities and earning potential, leading to financial instability and insecurity. This can impact an individual's ability to provide for themselves and their dependents, if any.
3. Housing Instability: Individuals with uncertain or undocumented immigration status may face challenges in securing stable and affordable housing, which can lead to homelessness or overcrowding in substandard living conditions.
4. Social Isolationation: Fear of deportation, stigma associated with immigration status, and difficulty navigating social services can lead to social isolation, loneliness, and depression among non-disabled individuals.
5. Education Disruption: Uncertain or undocumented immigration status can hinder access to education for children and young adults, leading to disruptions in their academic progress and potential long-term educational and career opportunities.
6. Family Separation: Uncertain or undocumented immigration status can result in family separation, as individuals may be unable to obtain legal documentation for their spouses, partners, or children, leading to emotional distress and instability within families.
7. Lack of Access to Legal Services: Non-disabled individuals with uncertain or undocumented immigration status may face barriers in accessing legal services, including those related to citizenship, immigration status, and criminal proceedings. This can lead to a lack of understanding of their rights and options, as well as increased vulnerability to exploitation or abuse.
8. Increased Vulnerability to Discrimination: Uncertain or undocumented immigration status can make individuals more susceptible to discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and public services, leading to a decreased sense of safety and well-being.
