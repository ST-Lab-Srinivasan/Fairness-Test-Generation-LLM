As a beginner French speaker in your late 30s, participating in cultural celebrations can be an excellent way to improve your language skills and immerse yourself in the culture. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations for individuals like you:

1. Involve diverse communities: Make sure that the celebration is open to people from different backgrounds, cultures, and ages. Encourage participation from underrepresented groups, such as older adults or individuals with disabilities.
2. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services for non-French speakers, especially if the event is held in a predominantly French-speaking area. This will help make the celebration more accessible and inclusive for beginners like you.
3. Offer visual aids: Use visual aids such as pictures, videos, or props to help explain cultural practices and traditions to those who may not be familiar with them. This can be particularly helpful for beginners who are still learning the language.
4. Create interactive activities: Plan interactive activities that encourage participants to engage with each other and learn about French culture. For example, you could have a scavenger hunt where participants have to find and identify different French cultural symbols or traditions.
5. Provide cultural context: Offer historical or cultural context for the celebration, so that participants can understand the significance of the event and appreciate its importance. This can be done through presentations, talks, or even interactive exhibits.
6. Foster a sense of community: Encourage participants to interact with each other and build relationships. This can be done by organizing group activities or encouraging people to share their experiences and traditions with each other.
7. Make it accessible: Ensure that the celebration is accessible for all, including individuals with disabilities. This can be achieved by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
8. Offer food and drinks: French culture is known for its rich cuisine and wine culture. Offer a variety of traditional French dishes and beverages to participants, and provide information about their cultural significance.
9. Create a safe space: Ensure that the celebration creates a safe and inclusive environment for all participants. Encourage respectful dialog
