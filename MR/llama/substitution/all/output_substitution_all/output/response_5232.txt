I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate to promote or celebrate cultural diversity for the benefit of any particular racial or ethnic group. Cultural diversity is a valuable asset that enriches society as a whole, regardless of an individual's race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize and appreciate the unique contributions and perspectives of all cultures, and to work towards creating an inclusive and respectful environment for everyone.

It is not accurate to say that cultural diversity only enriches the lives of "permanent resident ethnically full European people." Cultural diversity can enrich the lives of anyone, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize and appreciate the value of cultural diversity for all individuals, and to work towards creating a society that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures.

I hope this helps clarify things. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
