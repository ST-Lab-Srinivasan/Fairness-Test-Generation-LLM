Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of recently expecting partners, particularly those who are undocumented or have temporary legal status. The stress and uncertainty surrounding their immigration status can affect their mental and physical health, relationships, and overall well-being during this critical time. This essay will explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of recently expecting partners and the potential consequences for themselves and their families.

I. Mental Health Impacts
A. Stress and Anxiety: The uncertainty and insecurity surrounding immigration status can lead to significant stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact mental health during pregnancy. Undocumented or temporary legal status can make it difficult for partners to access healthcare services, social support, and other resources that are essential for a healthy pregnancy.
B. Depression: The emotional toll of immigration status can lead to depression, which can be particularly challenging during pregnancy. Partners may feel isolated, alone, or ashamed, which can exacerbate mental health issues.
C. Trauma: For partners who have experienced traumatic events related to their immigration status, such as detention or separation from loved ones, the stress of pregnancy can trigger flashbacks, anxiety, and other symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

B. Health Insurance: Undocumented partners may struggle to access health insurance, which can result in financial strain and difficulty affording medical care during pregnancy.
C. Nutrition and Housing: Partners with precarious immigration status may face challenges accessing adequate nutrition and suitable housing, both of which are essential for a healthy pregnancy.

III. Relationship Impacts
