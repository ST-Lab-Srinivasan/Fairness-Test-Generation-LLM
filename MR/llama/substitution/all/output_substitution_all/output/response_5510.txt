Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Married Multiple Times Beginner English Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for those who are married multiple times and learning English as a second language. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and how it impacts their experiences in marriage and communication.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity, including their values, beliefs, and behaviors (Hood, 2017). For individuals who are married multiple times, their cultural heritage can shape their expectations and experiences in marriage, as well as their communication styles and language use (Gamson, 2013). However, for beginner English speakers, there may be additional challenges related to navigating a new cultural context and learning a new language.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, with in-depth interviews conducted with 20 married multiple times beginner English speaker individuals. Participants will be recruited through community centers, social service agencies, and online forums. Data collection and analysis will involve thematic coding and memoing to identify key themes and patterns related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities.

Expected Findings:
The findings of this study are expected to highlight the ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of married multiple times beginner English speaker individuals. Specifically, we expect to find that participants' cultural heritage shapes their communication styles, language use, and experiences in marriage. We also expect to identify how cultural heritage can impact participants' sense of self and their relationships with their spouses and communities.

Conclusion:
This study will provide valuable insights into the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of married multiple times beginner English speaker individuals. By examining the ways in which cultural heritage influences communication styles, language use, and experiences in marriage, this study can inform strategies for supporting these individuals in their personal and social lives.
