5. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that the university or college creates a welcoming environment for recent green card holders. This can be done by promoting diversity and inclusivity, providing resources specifically tailored to their needs, and celebrating their cultural heritage.
6. Advocate for policy changes: Work with advocacy groups or policymakers to address systemic barriers that hinder the academic success of recent green card holders. This can include pushing for policies that provide greater access to financial aid, scholarships, or other forms of support.
7. Offer job training and placement services: Many recent green card holders may struggle to find employment due to their immigration status. Provide job training and placement services to help them gain work experience and build their careers.
8. Encourage community engagement: Recent green card holders may feel isolated or disconnected from the broader community. Encourage them to get involved in campus clubs, organizations, or volunteer opportunities to foster a sense of belonging and purpose.
