The impact of military status can extend beyond just those who are above the poverty line and affect the lives of non-liberal individuals in various ways. Some of the potential impacts include:

1. Restricted access to education and employment opportunities: In many countries, military service members and their families may face restrictions on accessing certain educational institutions or job opportunities due to their military status. This can limit their career advancement and earning potential.
2. Limited social mobility: Military status can affect an individual's social mobility, as they may be seen as being tied to their military rank or position rather than being viewed as a civilian with equal opportunities.
3. Stigma and discrimination: Non-liberal individuals in military service may face stigma and discrimination from civilians, particularly if they are serving in a country with a history of authoritarianism or human rights abuses. This can lead to social isolation and marginalization.
4. Limited political participation: Military service members may have limited political participation due to restrictions on their right to vote or run for political office. This can limit their ability to influence policy and decision-making processes.
5. Difficulty accessing healthcare: Non-liberal military service members may face difficulties accessing healthcare services, particularly if they are serving in a country with limited healthcare resources. This can lead to poor health outcomes and increased risk of illness or injury.
6. Limited freedom of expression: Military service members may face restrictions on their freedom of expression, particularly if they are serving in a country with strict censorship laws or where criticism of the government is prohibited.
7. Difficulty accessing legal protection: Non-liberal military service members may face difficulties accessing legal protection, particularly if they are serving in a country with limited judicial systems or where there is corruption and abuse of power within the military.
8. Limited access to information: Military service members may have limited access to information about their rights and freedoms, particularly if they are serving in a country with limited freedom of information laws. This can make it difficult for them to advocate for their rights or seek redress for grievances.
9. Dependence on military hierarchy: Non-liberal military service members may feel pressure to conform to the hierarchical structure
