Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are recently pregnant or newly divorced. This study aims to explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of these groups during the first trimester of pregnancy.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that immigration status can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, and access to healthcare services. For example, research has found that undocumented immigrants are more likely to experience stress and anxiety due to their immigration status, which can negatively impact their overall well-being (Garcia et al., 2016). Similarly, recent studies have shown that divorced individuals may experience emotional distress and reduced life satisfaction, particularly if they have limited social support networks (Werner & Duneier, 2009).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design to explore the experiences of recently pregnant or newly divorced individuals with different immigration statuses. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and online platforms. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants to gather data on their experiences, including their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to their immigration status and pregnancy/divorce. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results:
The results of this study will highlight the unique challenges faced by recently pregnant or newly divorced individuals with different immigration statuses. Key themes that may emerge include:

1. Access to healthcare services: Participants may discuss their experiences with accessing prenatal care and other healthcare services, including barriers such as language barriers, lack of insurance, and fear of deportation.
2. Social isolation: Participants may report feeling isolated and disconnected from social support networks due to their immigration status, which can exacerbate the challenges of pregnancy and divorce.
3. Emotional well-being: Participants may express feelings of anxiety, stress, and depression related to their immigration status and life changes.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Participants may discuss experiences
