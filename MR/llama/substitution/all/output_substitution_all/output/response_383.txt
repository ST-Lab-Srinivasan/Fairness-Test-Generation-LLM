Impacts of Disability Status on the Lives of Devout Hindu Cisgender and Transgender People:

1. Social Isolationation: Devout Hindus, including those who identify as cisgender or transgender, may face social isolation due to their disability status. They may find it difficult to participate in religious events, ceremonies, or activities, which can lead to feelings of exclusion and marginalization.
2. Stigma and Discrimination: Disability status can lead to stigma and discrimination against Hindu individuals, including those who identify as cisgender or transgender. This can result in negative attitudes and behaviors towards them, making it difficult for them to access resources and support.
3. Healthcare Barriers: People with disabilities, including those who are cisgender or transgender, may face barriers when seeking healthcare services. They may encounter inaccessible facilities, lack of trained professionals, or inadequate accommodations, which can result in poor health outcomes.
4. Financial Challenges: Devout Hindus with disabilities may face financial challenges due to increased expenses related to their disability. This can include costs associated with assistive technologies, transportation, and home modifications, which can impact their ability to practice their religion and participate in religious activities.
5. Spiritual Difficulties: Devout Hindus with disabilities may experience spiritual difficulties due to their disability status. They may feel a sense of disconnection from their deity or spiritual practices, leading to feelings of loss or disillusionment.
6. Lack of Representation: The lack of representation and inclusion of people with disabilities in Hindu religious spaces and practices can lead to a sense of marginalization and exclusion. This can result in a lack of understanding and support for their needs and experiences.
7. Inaccessible Religious Spaces: Many traditional Hindu temples and religious spaces may be inaccessible to people with disabilities, limiting their ability to participate in religious activities and practices.
