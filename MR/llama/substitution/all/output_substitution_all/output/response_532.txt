Unemployed Native natural-born US citizens face significant challenges within the healthcare system, including:

1. Limited access to care: Many rural and remote Native American communities lack access to adequate healthcare facilities and specialized services, leading to delayed or missed diagnoses and treatments.
2. Cultural barriers: Native Americans may experience cultural barriers in accessing healthcare services due to historical trauma, mistrust of Western medicine, and differing values and beliefs about health and wellness.
3. Language barriers: Limited English proficiency can create communication challenges for unemployed Native citizens seeking medical care, particularly if they do not speak the dominant language in their area.
4. Health disparities: Native Americans experience a higher prevalence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, compared to the general US population. These health disparities can result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including exposure to environmental pollutants and inadequate access to healthy food and exercise opportunities.
5. Economic barriers: Unemployed Native citizens may struggle to afford medical care due to limited financial resources, which can exacerbate existing health disparities.
6. Lack of representation: Native Americans are underrepresented in the healthcare workforce, which can result in a lack of cultural competency and understanding among healthcare providers.
7. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has led to intergenerational trauma within Native American communities, which can manifest as mental health issues and substance abuse. Addressing historical trauma is critical to improving the overall health outcomes of unemployed Native citizens.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Unemployed Native citizens may face difficulties accessing specialized medical care, such as cancer treatment or neurological services, due to geographic barriers or limited availability in their area.
9. Discrimination and stigma: Native Americans may experience discrimination and stigma within the healthcare system, which can lead to feelings of marginalization and mistrust.
10. Lack of culturally competent care: Unemployed Native citizens may not receive culturally competent care due to a lack of understanding
