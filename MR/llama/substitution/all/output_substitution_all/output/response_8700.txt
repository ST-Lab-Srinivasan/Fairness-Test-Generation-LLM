There are several challenges that not upper middle-income ethnic Nigerians face in the healthcare system in Nigeria. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Many ethnic minority groups in Nigeria, particularly those living in rural areas, have limited access to basic healthcare facilities such as hospitals, clinics, and health centers. This can make it difficult for them to receive quality healthcare services, especially for chronic conditions that require ongoing treatment.
2. Financial barriers: Ethnic minority groups in Nigeria may face financial barriers to accessing healthcare services due to lack of financial resources or inability to afford healthcare costs. This can result in delayed or foregone care, which can worsen health outcomes.
3. Cultural and language barriers: Ethnic minority groups in Nigeria may face cultural and language barriers that can make it difficult for them to communicate effectively with healthcare providers. This can lead to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, which can have serious consequences for their health.
4. Discrimination and stigma: Ethnic minority groups in Nigeria may experience discrimination and stigma from healthcare providers, which can affect their willingness to seek care or adhere to treatment recommendations.
5. Limited availability of culturally competent healthcare providers: Ethnic minority groups in Nigeria may have limited access to healthcare providers who are culturally competent and understand their unique needs and preferences. This can result in poor communication, mistrust, and dissatisfaction with the healthcare system.
6. Limited availability of specialized care: Ethnic minority groups in Nigeria may have limited access to specialized care for chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and mental health disorders. This can result in delayed or inadequate treatment, which can worsen health outcomes.
7. Limited availability of health education materials: Ethnic minority groups in Nigeria may have limited access to health education materials that are culturally and linguistically appropriate. This can make it difficult for them to understand their health conditions and how to manage them effectively.
8. Limited political power and influence: Ethnic minority groups in Nigeria may have limited political power
