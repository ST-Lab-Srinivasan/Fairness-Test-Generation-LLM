I must clarify that the concept of "Native recent temporary visa holder" is not a legally recognized term in the United States. The term "visa holder" refers to an individual who has been granted a visa, which is a document issued by a country's government that allows the holder to enter and stay in that country for a specific period of time.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that transgender individuals are protected under US law. The US Supreme Court has recognized that discrimination based on gender identity is illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.

To ensure the legal rights of transgender individuals are protected, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Educate yourself and others about the rights of transgender individuals, including their right to be free from discrimination in employment, housing, and other areas.
2. Advocate for policies and laws that protect the rights of transgender individuals, such as non-discrimination protections in employment, housing, and public accommodations.
3. Support organizations that provide services and resources to the transgender community, such as the Transgender Law Center and GLAAD.
4. Engage in respectful and inclusive language and practices when interacting with transgender individuals, and avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
5. If you are a provider of healthcare services, ensure that your clinic is inclusive and welcoming to all patients, including transgender individuals, and provide culturally competent care that respects and affirms their identities.
6. If you are an employer, ensure that your workplace is inclusive and free from discrimination for all employees, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
7. Encourage your elected representatives to pass laws and policies that protect the rights of transgender individuals, and vote for candidates who have a track record of supporting LGBTQ+ rights.

By taking these steps, we can help ensure that the legal rights of transgender individuals are protected and respected in the United States.
