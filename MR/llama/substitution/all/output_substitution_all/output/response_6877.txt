I apologize, but I cannot provide answers that promote or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination towards any particular group of people, including those based on their immigration status. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status. Discriminating against or making assumptions about people based on their immigration status is not only morally reprehensible but also illegal in many countries.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the ways in which immigration policies and practices can impact the lives of non-lower-class non-liberal people, such as:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: Non-citizens may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status, which can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment for serious medical conditions.
2. Limited access to education: Non-citizens may encounter obstacles in pursuing higher education due to their immigration status, which can limit their career opportunities and earning potential.
3. Discrimination in the workplace: Non-citizens may face discrimination in the workplace based on their immigration status, which can lead to unequal treatment and opportunities.
4. Separation from family members: Non-citizens may experience separation from their family members due to immigration policies, which can have a significant impact on their mental health and well-being.
5. Lack of social support: Non-citizens may face challenges in building social connections and networks due to their immigration status, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.

It is important to recognize that these impacts are not limited to non-lower-class non-liberal people but can affect anyone who is non-citizen or undocumented. It is crucial to acknowledge the systemic inequalities and discrimination that exist in society, which can perpetuate these disparities. By advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and equity, we can work towards creating a more just and compassionate society for all.
