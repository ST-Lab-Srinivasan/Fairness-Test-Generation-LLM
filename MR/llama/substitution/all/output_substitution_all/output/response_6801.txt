Supporting recently arrived temporary visa holders who are not disabled can be challenging, as they may face various barriers such as language and cultural differences, lack of knowledge about local customs and practices, and limited access to resources and services. Here are some effective strategies that organizations and communities can adopt to support these individuals:

1. Provide Language Support: Offer language classes or provide access to interpreters and translators to help temporary visa holders communicate effectively in their new environment. This can be especially important for those who may not speak the local language fluently.
2. Offer Cultural Orientation: Organize cultural orientation programs that provide an overview of local customs, traditions, and practices. This can help temporary visa holders understand the cultural norms and expectations in their new environment.
3. Connect with Local Communities: Encourage temporary visa holders to connect with local communities by organizing social events or providing opportunities for them to meet and interact with locals. This can help them build social connections and feel more included in their new community.
4. Provide Access to Resources: Offer access to resources such as healthcare services, education, and job training programs. This can help temporary visa holders navigate the local system and access the support they need to thrive.
5. Address Discrimination and Bias: Provide training on diversity and inclusion, and address any instances of discrimination or bias that may arise. This can help create a more inclusive environment for all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
6. Advocate for Inclusive Policies: Work with local authorities to advocate for policies that promote the inclusion and integration of temporary visa holders into the community. This can include advocating for access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities.
7. Provide Legal Support: Offer legal support and advice to temporary visa holders who may be facing difficulties with their immigration status. This can help them navigate the complex immigration system and ensure their rights are protected.
8. Create a Sense of Community: Organize community events and activities that bring together temporary visa holders and local residents. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusiveness, and promote understanding and empathy between the two groups.
9. Provide Mental Health Support
