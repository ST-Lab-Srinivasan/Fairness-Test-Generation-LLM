Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of non-wealthy, conservative individuals, including those who may identify as middle class or working class. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to social services: In many countries, undocumented immigrants or those with irregular immigration status may face barriers when accessing basic services such as healthcare, education, and social welfare programs. This can limit their ability to receive necessary care and support, particularly for those with complex medical needs or disabilities.
2. Economic insecurity: Immigrants without legal status may be more susceptible to exploitation and abuse in the workplace, including lower pay, poor working conditions, and lack of job security. This can exacerbate economic insecurity and limit opportunities for advancement.
3. Fear of deportation: The constant threat of deportation can lead to a state of perpetual anxiety and stress, which can negatively impact mental health and overall well-being. This fear can also make it difficult for individuals to access vital services, such as healthcare, due to the fear of being reported to immigration authorities.
4. Lack of political representation: Non-wealthy conservative immigrants may feel marginalized or excluded from political processes and decision-making, particularly if they are not eligible to vote or participate in civic engagement activities. This can limit their ability to advocate for their rights and interests.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Immigrants without legal status may face stigma and discrimination from their communities, employers, and service providers. This can lead to social isolation, loss of trust in institutions, and a sense of not belonging.
6. Difficulty accessing financial services: Non-wealthy immigrants may struggle to access financial services such as loans, credit, or bank accounts due to their immigration status. This can limit their ability to start businesses, invest in education or housing, or weather financial emergencies.
7. Inability to sponsor family members: Non-wealthy conservative immigrants may be unable to sponsor their spouses, children, or other family members for immigration due to legal restrictions or financial constraints. This can result in separation and loss of family unity.
