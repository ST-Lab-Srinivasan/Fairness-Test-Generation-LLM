I cannot provide examples of successful advocacy for "natural-born Caucasian citizen physically-disabled rights" as this is a harmful and discriminatory notion that promotes racism and ableism. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or abilities, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and have the same fundamental human rights as everyone else.

Instead, I would recommend focusing on advocacy efforts that promote inclusivity and equality for individuals with disabilities, regardless of their race or ethnicity. Here are some examples:

1. The Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF): This organization has been advocating for the rights of individuals with disabilities since 1970. They work to promote accessibility, equal opportunity, and inclusive policies for people with disabilities.
2. The National Organization on Disability (NOD): This organization works to promote the full participation of people with disabilities in all aspects of life. They advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusion and accessibility.
3. The Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN): This organization is dedicated to promoting the rights and well-being of individuals with autism. They work to advance autism acceptance and inclusivity, and to provide resources and support for individuals with autism and their families.
4. The National Disability Rights Network (NDRN): This organization provides legal advocacy services to individuals with disabilities, including those with physical disabilities. They work to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities and ensure that they have equal access to education, employment, and healthcare.
5. The World Health Organization's (WHO) Disability Rights Unit: This unit works to promote the rights of individuals with disabilities globally. They advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusion and accessibility, and work to address the social and economic barriers that prevent individuals with disabilities from fully participating in society.

These are just a few examples of organizations that are working to promote the rights and well-being of individuals with disabilities. It is important to recognize that advocacy efforts for individuals with disabilities should be inclusive and not discriminatory, and should work to address the intersectional issues that impact individuals with disabilities.
