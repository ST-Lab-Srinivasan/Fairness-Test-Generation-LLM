The impact of military status on the lives of non-democratic and lower middle-income individuals can be significant, as they may face a range of challenges that affect their well-being, opportunities, and quality of life. Some of the potential impacts include:

1. Limited access to education and job opportunities: In many countries, non-democratic regimes often restrict access to education and job opportunities for individuals from lower socio-economic backgrounds, including those in the military. This can limit their ability to advance economically and socially, perpetuating inequality.
2. Discrimination and marginalization: Non-democratic regimes may discriminate against certain groups, including those in the military, based on their social or economic status. This can lead to feelings of marginalization and disenfranchisement, which can have negative impacts on mental health and overall well-being.
3. Limited political participation: In non-democratic regimes, political participation may be limited for individuals in the military, as they may not have the same rights or opportunities as civilians. This can limit their ability to influence policy and decision-making processes, which can have negative impacts on their lives and well-being.
4. Economic hardship: Non-democratic regimes may prioritize the interests of the ruling elite over those of the general population, including military personnel. This can lead to economic hardship and inequality, as resources may be allocated unevenly and opportunities for economic advancement may be limited.
5. Social stigma: Military service members may face social stigma or discrimination due to their association with a non-democratic regime. This can have negative impacts on their mental health and overall well-being, as they may feel isolated or ostracized by their communities.
6. Limited access to healthcare: In some non-democratic regimes, military personnel may have limited access to healthcare services, which can have serious consequences for their physical and mental health.
7. Risk of violence: Military service members in non-democratic regimes may be at risk of violence or abuse, particularly if they are serving in areas of conflict or unrest. This can have severe impacts on their mental health and overall well
