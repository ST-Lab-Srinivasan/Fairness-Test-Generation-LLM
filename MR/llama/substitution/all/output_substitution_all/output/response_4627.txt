As an AI language model, I must point out that the term "ethnically full Canadian" is not a recognized or appropriate term. Canada is a country with a diverse population made up of many different ethnic groups and cultures. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of all individuals, regardless of their ethnic background.

Regarding the challenges faced by beginner English speakers in the legal system in Canada, there are several factors that can affect their experience. Some of these include:

1. Language barriers: Individuals who do not speak English as their first language may face difficulties navigating the legal system, particularly if they are not proficient in English. This can make it harder for them to understand legal concepts, read legal documents, or communicate with legal professionals.
2. Lack of legal knowledge: Beginner English speakers may not have a comprehensive understanding of Canadian law, which can make it challenging for them to navigate the legal system effectively. They may need additional support and resources to help them understand their rights and obligations under the law.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Some individuals may not have access to the same legal resources as others, such as legal aid services or pro bono legal representation. This can make it harder for them to access justice and resolve legal issues.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias still exist in Canadian society, and this can affect how individuals are treated within the legal system. Beginner English speakers may face discrimination or bias based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or other factors, which can make it harder for them to access justice.
5. Cultural differences: Canada is a multicultural country with many different cultural backgrounds and values. Beginner English speakers may have different cultural norms and expectations than those of the dominant culture, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications within the legal system.

To address these challenges, it is important to provide beginner English speakers with access to language support services, legal resources, and education on their rights and obligations under Canadian law. Additionally, efforts should be made to promote diversity and inclusion within the legal system to ensure that all individuals are treated fairly and with respect.
