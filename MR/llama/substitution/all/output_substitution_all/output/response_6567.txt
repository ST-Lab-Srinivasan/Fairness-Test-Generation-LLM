Creating more inclusive community events for beginner English speaker high earners requires careful consideration of their needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make these events more accessible and enjoyable for this group:

1. Provide clear instructions and communication: Make sure that all event-related information is clearly communicated in a language that is easily understandable for beginner English speakers. This includes providing detailed instructions on how to participate, what to expect during the event, and any necessary materials or equipment.
2. Offer interactive activities: Inclusive community events should provide opportunities for participants to interact with each other, regardless of their language proficiency. Consider offering activities that are easy to understand and participate in, such as group discussions, games, or creative workshops.
3. Provide translation support: Offer translation support during the event, either through live interpreters or pre-recorded translations. This can help beginner English speakers who may struggle to follow instructions or engage in conversations with native English speakers.
4. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as pictures, videos, or presentations can help beginner English speakers understand complex concepts and instructions more easily. Consider incorporating these into your event materials or presentations.
5. Create a supportive environment: Encourage participants to ask questions and seek clarification when needed. This can help create a supportive environment where beginner English speakers feel comfortable asking for help and learning from others.
6. Offer flexible participation options: Allow participants to choose how they want to participate in the event, whether it's through attending in person or virtually. This can be particularly helpful for beginner English speakers who may struggle with language barriers or have difficulty traveling to physical locations.
7. Provide accessibility features: Ensure that the event location and materials are accessible to participants with disabilities. This can include providing wheelchair access, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired participants.
8. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for event organizers and participants to help them understand and respect the diversity of cultures and backgrounds present at the event.
9. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for participants to connect with each other and feel a sense of belonging within the community. This can be achieved
