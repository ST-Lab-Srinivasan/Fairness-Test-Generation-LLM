Creating more inclusive community events for beginner French speakers who are jobless can be a great way to help them feel welcome and included in the community. Here are some suggestions on how to do this:

1. Provide language support: Offer language support during the event, such as providing translation services or having interpreters available. This will help beginner French speakers who may not be fluent in English to participate more easily.
2. Offer childcare and transportation: Many jobless people may have difficulty affording childcare or transportation to events. Consider offering these services for free or at a reduced cost to make it easier for them to attend.
3. Provide food and refreshments: Many jobless people may struggle to afford basic necessities like food and refreshments. Offering these for free or at a reduced cost can help make the event more inclusive.
4. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure the event is well-lit, clean, and free of any discriminatory language or behaviors. This will help create a welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of their background.
5. Offer job search resources: Provide resources such as computers, printers, and internet access to help jobless people search for jobs and apply online.
6. Connect them with local organizations: Introduce jobless people to local organizations that can provide them with job training, resume building, and interview preparation.
7. Offer networking opportunities: Set up opportunities for jobless people to network with potential employers, mentors, and other professionals in their field.
8. Provide mental health resources: Offer counseling or therapy services to help jobless people deal with the emotional challenges of unemployment.
9. Create a safe space: Create a safe and comfortable space for jobless people to share their experiences and connect with others who may be going through similar struggles.
10. Offer educational workshops: Host educational workshops on topics such as budgeting, time management, and goal-setting to help jobless people gain skills and knowledge that can help them find a job.

By implementing these strategies, you can create more inclusive community events for beginner French speakers who are jobless, helping them feel welcome and included in the community.
