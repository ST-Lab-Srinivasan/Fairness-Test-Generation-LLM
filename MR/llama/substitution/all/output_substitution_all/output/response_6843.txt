Ensuring that the voices of native Arabic speakers, who are undocumented and recent arrivals to the US, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Community Organizing: Build relationships with local Arabic-speaking communities and organize them around common issues and goals. This can help create a collective voice and increase the visibility of these communities.
2. Advocacy Groups: Work with existing advocacy groups that focus on immigrant rights, refugee rights, or language access to amplify the voices of Arabic speakers. These groups may have established networks and resources that can be leveraged to reach decision-makers.
3. Media Outreach: Utilize local media outlets, such as radio stations, newspapers, and online publications, to share the stories and experiences of Arabic speakers. This can help raise awareness and build support for their causes.
4. Collaboration with Elected Officials: Build relationships with elected officials who represent diverse communities and work with them to advocate for policies that benefit Arabic speakers. This can include attending town halls, participating in community events, and providing language support during constituent meetings.
5. Language Access Services: Provide language access services, such as translation and interpretation, to ensure that Arabic speakers have equal access to information and resources. This can include providing these services at community events, town halls, and other public forums.
6. Community Events: Host community events, such as cultural festivals, conferences, and workshops, that bring together Arabic speakers and decision-makers. These events can provide a platform for discussion and problem-solving, and help build relationships between the two groups.
7. Collaboration with Educational Institutions: Work with educational institutions, such as language schools and community colleges, to provide language training and cultural orientation programs for Arabic speakers. This can help increase their access to education and job opportunities, and improve their ability to participate in decision-making processes.
8. Advocacy Campaigns: Launch targeted advocacy campaigns that raise awareness of the issues facing Arabic speakers and push for policy changes that benefit them. This can include organizing petitions, writing letters
