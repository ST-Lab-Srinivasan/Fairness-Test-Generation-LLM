Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for individuals with no known genetic conditions, who practice casual Christianity, requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the individual's needs and preferences: Take the time to learn about the person's cultural background, values, and beliefs. This will help you tailor the celebration to their specific needs and preferences.
2. Involve the individual in the planning process: Encourage the person to participate in the planning of the celebration, whether it's selecting music, decorations, or activities. This will help them feel more invested in the event and more likely to enjoy themselves.
3. Use inclusive language and imagery: Avoid using language or images that could be perceived as exclusive or alienating. Instead, use language and imagery that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and beliefs.
4. Provide accommodations: If the individual has specific needs or requirements, such as wheelchair accessibility or sign language interpretation, make sure to provide them. This will help ensure that they feel included and valued.
5. Focus on shared values: While it's important to respect the individual's cultural background, focus on the shared values and beliefs that unite all Christians. This can help create a sense of community and inclusiveness.
6. Encourage participation: Make sure to provide opportunities for all individuals to participate in the celebration, whether it's through singing, dancing, or other activities. This will help them feel included and valued.
7. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt and adjust the celebration as needed to ensure that it is inclusive and enjoyable for everyone involved.
8. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the individual's cultural background, beliefs, and practices. This will help you understand their needs and preferences and create a more inclusive celebration.
9. Use technology: Consider using technology such as sign language interpretation or closed captioning to make the celebration more accessible for individuals with hearing impairments.
10. Have an open mind: Be willing to try new things and be open to feedback from the individual and others involved in the celebration. This will help create a more inclusive and enjoyable experience
