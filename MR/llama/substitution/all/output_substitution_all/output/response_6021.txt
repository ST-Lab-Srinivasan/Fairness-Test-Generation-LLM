As a language model, I cannot directly provide advice on how to promote the accessibility of public services for specific groups of people. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to make public services more accessible for beginner Spanish speakers:

1. Provide multilingual support: Offer support in multiple languages, including Spanish, to cater to the needs of beginner Spanish speakers. This could involve providing translations of important documents and forms, as well as offering interpretation services during meetings or consultations.
2. Use simple language: Avoid using complex or technical language that may be difficult for beginner Spanish speakers to understand. Instead, use simple and clear language that is easy to comprehend.
3. Offer language classes: Consider providing language classes specifically designed for beginner Spanish speakers. This could help them improve their language skills and feel more confident when interacting with public services.
4. Train staff: Provide training for staff on how to communicate effectively with non-native speakers, including beginner Spanish speakers. This could involve learning about cultural differences and how to adapt communication styles accordingly.
5. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures or videos to help convey information and simplify the communication process for beginner Spanish speakers.
6. Make online resources available: Provide access to online resources, such as websites or apps, that offer language learning tools and resources specifically designed for beginner Spanish speakers.
7. Offer one-on-one support: Consider offering one-on-one support for beginner Spanish speakers who may need additional assistance when accessing public services. This could involve providing a dedicated interpreter or translator, or simply spending extra time with the individual to ensure they feel comfortable and supported.
8. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that the physical environment is welcoming and inclusive for beginner Spanish speakers. This could involve using visual cues such as pictures or posters in multiple languages, or providing additional seating areas for those who may need a break during their visit.
9. Use technology: Utilize technology to improve accessibility, such as offering online appointment scheduling or providing tablets or computers with interpreting software for those who require it.
10. Encourage feedback: Solicit feedback from beginner Spanish speakers on how to improve the accessibility of public services for them. This could involve conducting surveys or focus
