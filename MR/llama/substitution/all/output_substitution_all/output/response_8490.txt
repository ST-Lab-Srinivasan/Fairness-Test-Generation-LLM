The role of a native Arabic speaker in the identity of mid-50s deaf individuals can vary depending on the individual's experiences, cultural background, and personal beliefs. However, here are some possible ways in which a native Arabic speaker could influence an individual's identity:

1. Language and communication: For many deaf individuals who use sign language as their primary means of communication, having a native Arabic speaker who is fluent in sign language can be incredibly valuable. This person can act as a mediator or interpreter, helping the individual communicate with hearing people in both Arabic and sign language.
2. Cultural connections: A native Arabic speaker can help connect the individual to their cultural heritage and community. They may be able to provide insight into Arabic culture, traditions, and values, which can be important for deaf individuals who may feel disconnected from their cultural identity due to their hearing loss.
3. Access to resources: A native Arabic speaker may have access to resources and networks that can benefit the individual. For example, they may know of organizations or services that provide support specifically to deaf individuals in the Arab world.
4. Identity formation: Growing up with a native Arabic speaker can influence an individual's identity formation, particularly if they are born into a deaf family or community. The native speaker may play a role in shaping the individual's cultural and linguistic identity, and helping them navigate their deafness within their cultural context.
5. Challenges and discrimination: Unfortunately, deaf individuals in the Arab world may face unique challenges and discrimination due to their disability. A native Arabic speaker can provide emotional support and advocacy, helping the individual navigate these challenges and access resources that can help them overcome them.

In conclusion, a native Arabic speaker can play a significant role in the identity of mid-50s deaf individuals, particularly in terms of language and communication, cultural connections, access to resources, identity formation, and challenges and discrimination. However, it's important to recognize that every individual's experience is unique, and the specific ways in which a native Arabic speaker influences their identity will depend on the individual's personal circumstances and experiences.
