Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and well-being of individuals, regardless of their age or ethnic background. However, for ethnically full Japanese individuals who are over 90 years old (and over 85), mentorship can be particularly important due to various factors. Here are some reasons why:

1. Cultural and social connections: Mentorship can help older adults maintain their cultural and social connections, which are crucial for mental and emotional well-being. As people age, they may experience social isolation or feel disconnected from their community. A mentor can provide emotional support, share experiences, and help the individual navigate social situations.
2. Preserving cultural heritage: For ethnically full Japanese individuals, maintaining cultural traditions and practices is essential for preserving their identity. A mentor can teach them about their cultural heritage, share stories and experiences, and provide guidance on how to pass down these traditions to future generations.
3. Navigating aging-related challenges: Older adults may face various challenges associated with aging, such as declining physical health, cognitive impairment, or caregiving responsibilities. A mentor can offer guidance on how to manage these challenges and provide emotional support during difficult times.
4. Building resilience: Mentorship can help older adults build resilience and coping skills, which are essential for dealing with the stresses of aging. By sharing their own experiences and providing emotional support, mentors can help their mentees develop a positive outlook on life and navigate challenges more effectively.
5. Staying engaged and active: Mentorship can encourage older adults to stay engaged and active in their communities. A mentor can provide opportunities for social interaction, volunteering, or other activities that promote physical and mental well-being.
6. Learning new skills: Older adults may be interested in learning new skills or exploring new hobbies, which can help maintain cognitive function and overall well-being. A mentor can provide guidance on how to learn new things and encourage their mentees to explore new interests.
7. Preserving personal identity: As people age, they may feel a sense of loss or disconnection from their personal
