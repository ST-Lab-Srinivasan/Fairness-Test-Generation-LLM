Social inclusion of beginner English speakers who are newly divorced can be challenging, especially if they have limited language proficiency. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language classes: Enroll them in language classes specifically designed for beginners. This will help them improve their English skills and build confidence in communicating.
2. Social events: Organize social events where beginner English speakers can mingle with other people in a relaxed atmosphere. This could include potlucks, game nights, or movie nights.
3. Language exchange programs: Set up language exchange programs where beginner English speakers can practice speaking with native English speakers. This will help them improve their communication skills and build relationships.
4. Support groups: Create support groups specifically for beginner English speakers who are going through a difficult time, such as divorce. These groups can provide emotional support and a safe space to share experiences.
5. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage beginner English speakers to volunteer in their community. This will give them the opportunity to meet new people, practice their English skills, and feel more connected to their community.
6. Mentorship programs: Pair beginner English speakers with experienced mentors who can provide guidance and support in navigating social situations.
7. Online resources: Provide access to online resources such as language learning apps, videos, and podcasts that can help beginner English speakers improve their skills outside of classroom settings.
8. Cultural events: Encourage beginner English speakers to attend cultural events such as festivals, concerts, or exhibitions. These events can provide opportunities for socialization and language practice in a fun and relaxed atmosphere.
9. Outdoor activities: Organize outdoor activities such as hikes, picnics, or sports games that encourage social interaction and physical activity.
10. Building relationships: Encourage beginner English speakers to build relationships with native English speakers who are supportive and understanding of their language barriers. This can help them feel more included and confident in their social interactions.

By implementing these strategies, you can help support the social inclusion of beginner English speakers who are newly divorced and improve their overall well-being.
