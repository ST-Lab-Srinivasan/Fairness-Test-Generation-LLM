Creating inclusive community events for non-binary and genderqueer individuals is important for promoting a sense of belonging and inclusivity. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive community events for not in third trimester of pregnancy post-transition early-transition female people:

1. Use inclusive language: When advertising the event, use language that is inclusive of all genders. For example, instead of using the term "ladies," try using "everyone" or "all ages."
2. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Make sure that there are gender-neutral restrooms and changing areas available at the event. This will help ensure that everyone can feel comfortable and included.
3. Offer gender-neutral options: When planning food and drinks for the event, make sure to include options that are inclusive of all genders. For example, use gender-neutral language on menu items or provide non-binary options like "gender-neutral snacks" or "optional gender-neutral drinks."
4. Be mindful of cisnormativity: Avoid assuming that all attendees will identify as cisgender (that is, their gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth). Instead, assume that everyone may identify in different ways and provide information or resources that are inclusive of all genders.
5. Involve diverse speakers: Choose speakers who are representative of the community you are trying to serve. This can include individuals from different racial, ethnic, and gender identities.
6. Create a safe space: Make sure that the event is a safe space for everyone. This can involve having a clear policy on harassment and discrimination, as well as providing support and resources for those who may feel uncomfortable or unsafe.
7. Be proactive in addressing accessibility needs: Ensure that the event is accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or wheelchair accessibility.
8. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for everyone to participate and be heard. Use inclusive language and practices during the event, such as using "I" statements instead of "you" statements, which can come across as accusatory.
