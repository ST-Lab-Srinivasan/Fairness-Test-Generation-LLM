Promoting the social inclusion of happily long-time widowed individuals who have been permanent residents in a community for many years requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and Awareness: Organize workshops, seminars, and awareness campaigns to educate the community about the needs and concerns of widowed individuals. This can help change attitudes and behaviors towards widows and promote their social inclusion.
2. Community Outreach Programs: Develop outreach programs that bring together widowed individuals with other members of the community. This can include cultural events, volunteer opportunities, and recreational activities that promote social interaction and build relationships.
3. Support Groups: Facilitate the formation of support groups for widows where they can share their experiences, receive emotional support, and build connections with others in similar situations.
4. Advocacy: Work with local organizations and advocacy groups to promote policies and laws that protect the rights of widowed individuals and promote their social inclusion.
5. Economic Empowerment: Provide training and support to help widows establish or expand their economic activities, such as microfinance programs, skills training, and entrepreneurship development. This can help them become financially independent and increase their self-esteem.
6. Healthcare Support: Offer healthcare services specifically tailored to the needs of widowed individuals, including mental health support, nutrition counseling, and access to primary care services.
7. Housing Support: Provide assistance with housing-related issues, such as home repairs, maintenance, and access to affordable housing options.
8. Childcare and Education: Offer childcare and educational support to help widows access opportunities for personal growth and development while also ensuring the well-being of their children.
9. Community Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations, businesses, and government agencies to create partnerships that benefit widowed individuals and promote social inclusion.
10. Advocacy for Policy Change: Work with policy makers to advocate for policies that support the rights of widows and promote their social inclusion, such as inheritance rights, access to social security benefits, and protection from discrimination.
