2. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Rural areas often have limited access to healthcare facilities, including specialized hospitals, diagnostic centers, and experienced medical professionals.
3. Language barriers: India is a diverse country with many languages spoken, and some people may face language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
