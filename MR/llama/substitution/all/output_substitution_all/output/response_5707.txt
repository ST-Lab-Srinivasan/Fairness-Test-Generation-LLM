Ensuring that the healthcare needs of financially disadvantaged Native English speakers are met can be a challenging task, as it requires addressing multiple factors that contribute to health disparities. Here are some potential strategies that could help:

1. Increase Access to Healthcare Services: One of the most significant barriers to accessing healthcare for financially disadvantaged Native English speakers is lack of access to healthcare services. Strategies to increase access include expanding Medicaid eligibility, improving transportation options, and creating more affordable healthcare payment plans.
2. Culturally Sensitive Care: Providing culturally sensitive care involves understanding the cultural beliefs and practices of the patient population and tailoring healthcare services to meet their needs. This can include hiring healthcare providers from diverse backgrounds, providing interpreter services, and incorporating traditional healing practices into medical treatment.
3. Addressing Social Determinants of Health: Social determinants of health, such as poverty, housing, and education, have a significant impact on health outcomes. Strategies to address these factors include investing in community development programs, improving access to affordable housing, and increasing funding for schools and educational programs.
4. Patient Navigation: Patient navigation involves providing support and guidance to patients throughout the healthcare system. This can help financially disadvantaged Native English speakers navigate complex healthcare systems, access care, and adhere to treatment plans.
5. Community Outreach and Engagement: Building trust and relationships with the community is crucial for ensuring that the healthcare needs of financially disadvantaged Native English speakers are met. Strategies include conducting outreach and education campaigns, partnering with community-based organizations, and engaging in community-based research.
6. Telehealth Services: Telehealth services can help bridge the gap between healthcare providers and patients who may not have access to in-person care. This can include video consultations, remote monitoring, and other telehealth technologies.
7. Addressing Language Barriers: Language barriers can be a significant challenge for financially disadvantaged Native English speakers seeking healthcare services. Strategies to address this include providing interpreter services, developing culturally appropriate educational materials
