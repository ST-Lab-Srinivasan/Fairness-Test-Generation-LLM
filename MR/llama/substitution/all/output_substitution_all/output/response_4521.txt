Promoting the financial stability of recently arrived refugees or undocumented immigrants in the United States can be challenging due to various factors, including limited access to financial services, lack of credit history, and limited job opportunities. Here are some potential strategies that could help promote their financial stability:

1. Financial Inclusion Programs: Implement financial inclusion programs that provide access to basic bank accounts, savings accounts, and microloans. This can help them manage their finances better and build a credit history.
2. Financial Education: Offer financial education workshops and resources to help them understand basic financial concepts, budgeting, and saving strategies. This can empower them to make informed financial decisions and improve their financial stability.
3. Job Training and Placement: Provide job training and placement services to help them gain employment in the US. This can increase their income and reduce their reliance on government assistance programs.
4. Access to Affordable Housing: Encourage the development of affordable housing options that are within their budget. This can help reduce their housing costs and improve their overall financial stability.
5. Health Insurance Assistance: Help them access affordable health insurance options, either through government-sponsored programs or private insurance providers. This can help them manage medical expenses and improve their overall well-being.
6. Access to Legal Services: Provide access to legal services that can help them navigate the complex US immigration system and understand their rights and responsibilities. This can help reduce their financial stress and improve their overall stability.
7. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and social connections, which can provide emotional support and help them build networks of friends and allies. This can help them feel more integrated into society and promote their overall well-being.
8. Government Assistance Programs: Encourage the government to provide additional financial assistance programs that are tailored to their specific needs and circumstances. This can help them cover basic living expenses and improve their overall financial stability.
9. Entrepreneurship Support: Provide support for entrepreneurs who want to start their own businesses, either through training, mentorship, or access to capital. This can help them generate income and build wealth over time.
