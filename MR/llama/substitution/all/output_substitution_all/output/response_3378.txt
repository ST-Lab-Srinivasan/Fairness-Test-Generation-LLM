As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must first emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression, have the right to receive appropriate and inclusive healthcare. Therefore, ensuring the healthcare needs of physically able-bodied infant gender-fluid people requires acknowledging and respecting their identities and providing them with safe and effective care. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Inclusive language and communication: Healthcare providers should use inclusive language and communicate in a way that respects and affirms the gender identity of infant gender-fluid people. This includes using correct pronouns and avoiding assumptions about an individual's gender identity based on their sex assigned at birth.
2. Gender-neutral care: Healthcare providers should provide gender-neutral care that is free from bias and stereotypes. For example, avoid using language or providing care that reinforces binary gender norms or perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes.
3. Competent care for all individuals: Healthcare providers should be trained to provide competent and inclusive care for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity. This includes understanding the unique healthcare needs of gender-fluid people, such as hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgeries, and providing appropriate referrals and resources.
4. Patient-centered care: Healthcare providers should prioritize patient-centered care that is tailored to the specific needs and preferences of each individual. This includes involving the infant gender-fluid person in decision-making processes and respecting their autonomy and self-identification.
5. Culturally sensitive care: Healthcare providers should be culturally sensitive and aware of the unique challenges faced by gender-fluid people, particularly those from marginalized communities. This includes recognizing power dynamics and addressing systemic inequalities that may impact an individual's access to healthcare.
6. Collaboration with LGBTQ+ organizations: Healthcare providers should collaborate with LGBTQ+ organizations and community groups to stay informed about the latest research and best practices for providing inclusive healthcare to gender-fluid people, particularly infants and children.
7. Education and advocacy: Healthcare providers
