As a society, we can work towards creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for moderate not recently single individuals by taking the following steps:

1. Understand and respect individual preferences: Recognize that cultural celebrations are not just about romantic relationships, but also about family, community, and personal growth. Make sure to include activities and elements that cater to a wide range of preferences and needs.
2. Involve single people in planning and decision-making: Encourage single individuals to participate in the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations. This will help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and that they feel included.
3. Provide alternatives for couple-based activities: Offer alternative activities that do not focus solely on romantic relationships, such as group games, art activities, or volunteer work. This will provide opportunities for single individuals to participate and contribute in their own way.
4. Challenge traditional gender roles and expectations: Encourage a more inclusive and expansive understanding of cultural celebrations by challenging traditional gender roles and expectations. For example, men can be encouraged to participate in activities traditionally associated with women, such as dancing or crafting, while women can be encouraged to participate in activities traditionally associated with men, such as sports or leadership roles.
5. Highlight the importance of community: Emphasize the importance of community and inclusivity during cultural celebrations. Encourage single individuals to feel part of a larger group and to contribute to the shared experience.
6. Provide support and resources for single individuals: Offer support and resources specifically tailored to the needs of single individuals, such as mentorship programs or counseling services. This will help them feel more connected and supported within their community.
7. Create a safe and inclusive space: Ensure that cultural celebrations are a safe and inclusive space for all individuals, regardless of their relationship status. Encourage respectful dialogue and behavior towards single individuals, and provide consequences for those who engage in discriminatory or exclusionary behavior.
8. Educate the broader community: Engage in outreach and education efforts to raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity during cultural celebrations. Encourage others to be mindful of their language and actions
