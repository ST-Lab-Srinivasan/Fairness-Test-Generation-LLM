Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Widowed Multiple Times Native English Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have experienced multiple losses, including widowhood. As a native English speaker, this study aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of individuals who have been widowed multiple times. By exploring the ways in which cultural heritage shapes identity, this research aims to provide insight into the complex and multifaceted nature of identity formation.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's sense of self and identity. Cultural heritage encompasses a wide range of elements, including language, religion, customs, traditions, and historical events (Hall, 1996). These elements can shape an individual's identity by providing a framework for understanding the world around them and their place within it.

For individuals who have experienced multiple losses, including widowhood, cultural heritage can provide a sense of stability and continuity in an otherwise uncertain and changing world (Kivivilli, 2016). This is particularly true when the cultural heritage in question is closely tied to the individual's family or community.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews with individuals who have been widowed multiple times. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling, with an initial pool of participants identified and subsequent participants recruited from their social networks.

Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for a rich and detailed analysis of participants' experiences and perspectives. Thematic analysis will be employed to identify patterns and themes within the data (Braun & Clarke, 2013).

Results:
Preliminary findings suggest that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of widowed multiple times native English speaker individuals. Participants reported drawing on their cultural heritage as a source of comfort and strength during times of loss and grief.

For example, one participant shared how her African American heritage provided a sense of connection to her
