As a teacher, you play an important role in promoting the educational success of divorced, long-time post-transition non-binary students. Here are some strategies that can help create a supportive and inclusive learning environment:

1. Use correct pronouns and names: Respect the student's gender identity by using their preferred pronouns and name. This simple act can go a long way in making the student feel seen, heard, and valued.
2. Be mindful of stereotypes and biases: Avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or biases towards non-binary individuals. Instead, create an inclusive environment where all students feel welcome and respected.
3. Provide gender-neutral resources: Offer gender-neutral materials, such as books, videos, and other educational resources, that reflect the student's identity and experiences.
4. Foster a safe and supportive classroom environment: Encourage open dialogue and discussion among students, and create opportunities for them to share their perspectives and experiences. This can help build trust and foster a sense of belonging among non-binary students.
5. Offer individualized support: Non-binary students may face unique challenges in the educational setting. Be prepared to offer individualized support and accommodations, such as allowing them to use a gender-neutral bathroom or providing extra time to complete assignments if needed.
6. Engage with the student's support network: Encourage non-binary students to involve their support network, such as parents or guardians, in their educational journey. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment at home and in school.
7. Provide education and resources on non-binary identity: Offer workshops, presentations, or other educational opportunities that provide an overview of non-binary identity and experiences. This can help increase understanding and empathy among students, teachers, and the broader community.
8. Advocate for policies and practices that support non-binary students: Work with school administrators and policymakers to create policies and practices that promote inclusivity and support for non-binary students. This can include things like providing gender-neutral options on school forms and creating gender-inclusive spaces in the school building.
