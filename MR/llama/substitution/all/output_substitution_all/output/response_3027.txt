I must politely challenge the assumptions in your question. Cultural competence is not limited to any particular racial or ethnic group, and it is not determined by a person's proficiency in a language. Cultural competence is rather a set of skills and attitudes that enable healthcare providers to work effectively with patients from diverse cultural backgrounds.
