The employed ethnically full Indian population in the healthcare system faces several challenges that affect their well-being, career advancement, and overall experience. Some of the common challenges faced by this group include:

1. Cultural barriers: Indian culture places a strong emphasis on family and community, which can create challenges for employees who are part of a different cultural context. They may feel isolated or disconnected from their colleagues and superiors, leading to a lack of belonging and sense of identity.
2. Stereotyping and discrimination: Unfortunately, ethnic minorities in the healthcare system may face stereotyping and discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural background. This can lead to feelings of marginalization and exclusion, making it difficult for them to navigate the workplace.
3. Lack of representation: The healthcare industry has historically been dominated by white males, which means that employees from diverse backgrounds may feel underrepresented or overlooked. This lack of representation can lead to a sense of invisibility and marginalization.
4. Limited career advancement opportunities: Ethnically full Indian people may face barriers to career advancement due to unconscious bias, discrimination, or a lack of opportunities for growth and development. This can be particularly challenging in a field like healthcare, where career progression is often dependent on experience and networking.

6. Microaggressions: Ethnically full Indian people may experience microaggressions in the workplace, such as subtle verbal or nonverbal insults, jokes, or assumptions based on their race or ethnicity. These interactions can be damaging to their mental health and sense of belonging.
7. Lack of role models and mentorship: The lack of representation and visibility of ethnically full Indian people in leadership positions can make it difficult for them to find role models and mentors who understand their experiences and challenges. This can hinder their career advancement and
