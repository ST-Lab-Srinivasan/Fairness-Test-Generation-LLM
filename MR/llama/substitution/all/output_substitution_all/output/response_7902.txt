Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-native English speakers requires a deliberate effort to break down language barriers and make these spaces accessible to all. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide multilingual signage and communications: Use signs, brochures, and other materials in multiple languages to ensure that everyone can understand the information being presented. This can include both written and visual aids, such as pictures and diagrams.
2. Offer language support services: Provide interpretation or translation services during public events or meetings to help non-native English speakers participate more fully. This can include live interpreting, video remote interpreting (VRI), or pre-recorded translations.
3. Use visual aids and simple language: Use visual aids such as pictures and diagrams to convey information, rather than relying solely on written text. Keep language simple and clear to avoid confusion or misunderstandings.
4. Provide accessible technology: Ensure that public spaces are equipped with technology that can be used by non-native English speakers, such as audio descriptions, closed captioning, or speech-to-text software.

6. Create a welcoming environment: Design public spaces that are visually appealing and welcoming to all, regardless of language proficiency. This can include the use of color, lighting, and other visual elements.
7. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Organize events or activities that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange, such as cultural festivals, workshops, or panel discussions.
8. Offer language classes or resources: Provide access to language classes or resources for non-native English speakers, either through partnerships with local organizations or by offering them in-house.
9. Use technology to facilitate communication: Utilize technology such as translation apps or video conferencing tools to facilitate communication between non-native English speakers and staff/volunteers.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Regularly assess the inclusivity of public spaces and gather feedback from non-native English speakers to identify
