As a queer-affirming and trauma-informed organization, we recognize that teen non-binary individuals may face unique challenges in disaster response situations. Here are some recommendations for addressing the needs of teen non-binary nominal Catholic individuals in disaster response:

1. Inclusive Language and Messaging: Use language and messaging that is inclusive and respectful of all gender identities. Avoid using binary gender language or assumptions, and instead use terms like "people," "individuals," or "community" to include non-binary individuals.
2. Safe Spaces: Provide safe spaces for teen non-binary individuals to express themselves and receive support. This can be done through designated gender-neutral facilities, such as bathrooms or changing rooms, or by creating a comfortable and welcoming environment in other spaces.
3. Gender-Neutral Communication: Use gender-neutral language and communication styles when interacting with teen non-binary individuals. Avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
4. Access to Care: Ensure that teen non-binary individuals have access to gender-affirming care, such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or gender confirmation surgeries, if needed. This can be done by providing referrals to LGBTQ+-friendly healthcare providers or by advocating for inclusive insurance coverage.
5. Education and Training: Provide education and training on issues affecting non-binary individuals, such as discrimination, stigma, and mental health concerns. This can help build understanding and empathy among disaster response workers and volunteers.
6. Advocacy and Allyship: Advocate for the rights and well-being of teen non-binary individuals in disaster response situations. This can involve speaking out against discrimination, supporting policies that promote inclusivity, and amplifying the voices of non-binary individuals in decision-making processes.
7. Partnership with LGBTQ+ Organizations: Partner with local LGBTQ+ organizations to provide support and resources specifically tailored to the needs of teen non-binary individuals. These partnerships can help ensure that disaster response efforts are inclusive and culturally competent
