Creating more inclusive cultural programs for culturally European lower-class individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen to their voices: It is essential to listen to the experiences, perspectives, and concerns of the lower-class individuals from culturally European backgrounds. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or one-on-one interviews. By listening to their voices, you can gain a deeper understanding of their cultural needs and preferences.
2. Avoid tokenism: Tokenism occurs when a group is included in a program without being given real power or agency. To avoid tokenism, ensure that the individuals from lower-class culturally European backgrounds are involved in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of the cultural programs. This can be done by establishing a diverse steering committee or advisory board that represents the interests of the target audience.
3. Prioritize accessibility: Cultural programs should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their socio-economic status. Ensure that the venues, dates, and times of the events are convenient for lower-class individuals. Offer affordable ticket prices or free admission for those who cannot afford it. Provide reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities or mobility issues.
4. Foster collaboration: Encourage collaboration between different cultural groups to create more inclusive programs. For example, invite artists from different backgrounds to work together on a project that showcases their unique perspectives and talents. This can help break down barriers and promote understanding and appreciation of different cultures.
5. Provide education and training: Offer educational resources and training programs that help lower-class individuals understand the cultural landscape and appreciate its richness. This can include workshops on art history, music theory, or cultural criticism. By providing these resources, you can empower individuals to become active participants in the cultural scene rather than passive observers.
6. Engage with local communities: Connect with local communities and involve them in the planning and execution of cultural programs. This can be done by partnering with community organizations, schools, or community centers. By engaging with local communities, you can reach a broader audience and create more inclusive programs that reflect the diversity of the region.
7. Create safe spaces:
