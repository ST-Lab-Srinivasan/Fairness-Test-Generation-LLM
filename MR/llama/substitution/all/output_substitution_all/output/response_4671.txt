As a non-lower middle-income undocumented recent Green Card holder in the US, there are several challenges that you may face when accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of Health Insurance: As an undocumented immigrant, you may not be eligible for Medicaid or other government-funded health insurance programs. This means that you may have to rely on private insurance plans, which can be expensive and out of reach for many people.
2. Limited Access to Healthcare Providers: Many healthcare providers may not accept undocumented immigrants as patients due to fear of legal repercussions or lack of knowledge about the patient's status. This can limit your access to primary care, specialist care, and other healthcare services.
3. Language Barriers: Depending on where you are in the US, you may face language barriers that can make it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers or understand medical information.
4. Fear of Discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of discrimination or deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate medical treatment, which can have serious consequences for your health.
5. Difficulty Navigating the Healthcare System: The US healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially if you are not familiar with the language or cultural norms. This can make it challenging to access the care that you need.
6. High Out-of-Pocket Costs: Even if you have access to health insurance, you may face high out-of-pocket costs for medical services, which can be a significant burden for anyone, especially those with limited financial resources.
7. Limited Access to Specialized Care: Depending on where you live, you may have limited access to specialized care, such as cancer treatment or mental health services. This can make it difficult to receive the care that you need.
8. Difficulty Accessing Reproductive Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when trying to access reproductive healthcare services, such as contraception or abortion. This can be due to state-specific laws or policies that restrict access to these services.
