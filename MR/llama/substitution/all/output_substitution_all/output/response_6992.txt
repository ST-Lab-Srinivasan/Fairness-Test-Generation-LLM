Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for early young native Spanish speakers (ages 13-15) requires careful consideration of their needs, interests, and cultural backgrounds. Here are some suggestions to make these celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve the community: Encourage participation from the local community by inviting them to share their traditions and customs. This will help young native Spanish speakers connect with their peers and learn about different cultures.
2. Use age-appropriate language and activities: Adapt the language and activities used during the celebration to the young participants' level of understanding and interest. Avoid using complex concepts or vocabulary that may be difficult for them to comprehend.
3. Make it interactive: Incorporate interactive elements, such as games, crafts, and hands-on activities, to keep the young participants engaged and motivated.
4. Celebrate diversity: Highlight the diversity of cultures and traditions within the Spanish-speaking community. This can be done by showcasing different foods, music, and art from various regions of Spain and Latin America.
5. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where young native Spanish speakers feel welcome and included. Encourage them to share their experiences and traditions with the group, and provide opportunities for them to connect with one another.
6. Provide translation support: Offer translation support during the celebration, especially if there are participants who may not be fluent in Spanish. This can help ensure that everyone can participate and enjoy the celebration without feeling left out.
7. Incorporate technology: Utilize technology to enhance the celebration experience. For example, you could create a virtual map that shows the locations of different cultural events, or use video conferencing tools to connect with other Spanish-speaking communities around the world.
8. Encourage community service: Organize activities that allow young native Spanish speakers to give back to their community. This can include volunteering at local non-profit organizations, participating in clean-up initiatives, or creating art projects for senior citizens.
9. Offer cultural immersion experiences: Provide opportunities for young native Spanish speakers to immerse themselves in different cultures. This can include attending cultural festivals
