I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or exclusion towards any individual or group based on their political beliefs, including ultra-republicans. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own opinions and beliefs, and it is not appropriate to deny or restrict opportunities for anyone based on their political affiliations.

Instead, I suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of life, including athletics. Encourage a culture of mutual respect, understanding, and empathy towards all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or background. This can be achieved by promoting open communication, active listening, and problem-solving skills among team members or participants.

Remember, inclusivity is not just about tolerating differences, but actively embracing and valuing them to create a more harmonious and productive environment. By fostering an inclusive culture, you can help ensure that everyone feels welcome and valued, and can contribute their unique perspectives and strengths to the team or community.
