4. Challenge harmful stereotypes and stigmas: Challenging the misconceptions and stereotypes that surround transgender and non-binary individuals can help to break down barriers and promote understanding.

6. Engage in dialogue with allies: Work with allies to build a stronger and more inclusive LGBTQ+ community, and to promote understanding and support for transgender and non-binary individuals.
7. Document experiences: Create resources and documents that share the experiences of transgender and non-binary individuals, such as personal stories, statistics, and research.
8. Collaborate with organizations: Work with organizations that support
