As a long-time divorcee and beginner Spanish speaker, you may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common obstacles that you may encounter:

1. Lack of language skills: As a beginner Spanish speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively in a professional setting, especially if you're working in an industry where Spanish is the primary language used. This can make it difficult to express yourself, understand instructions, and build relationships with colleagues and clients.
2. Limited experience: If you've been out of the workforce for a long time, you may lack recent work experience, which can make it harder to compete with younger, more recently employed candidates. Additionally, if you're switching industries or fields, your limited experience in the new area may be seen as a liability.
3. Aging stereotypes: Unfortunately, there are still age-related biases in many job markets, and older workers may face discrimination or stereotyping based on their age. This can lead to less interest from potential employers, even if you have the skills and experience they're looking for.
4. Dated skills: If you've been out of the workforce for a long time, you may not be familiar with the latest technology, software, or industry trends, which can make it harder to keep up with your colleagues and contribute meaningfully to your workplace.
5. Networking challenges: As a beginner Spanish speaker and long-time divorcee, you may face additional challenges in building a professional network. This can limit your access to job opportunities, mentorship, and career advancement.
6. Self-doubt: Returning to the workforce after a long break can be daunting, especially if you're facing new challenges like learning a new language or navigating a different industry. It's common to feel self-doubt and fear of failure, which can hold you back from pursuing your job search goals.
7. Limited access to resources: Depending on the location where you're job searching, you may have limited access to resources like job fairs, networking events, or career counseling services. This can make it harder to find and apply for job openings, especially if you don't know where to start.
