Introduction:
The impact of military status on the lives of beginner English speaker conservative individuals can be significant, as it can affect various aspects of their life, including their language learning experience. This paper aims to explore the experiences of beginner English speakers who are conservative and have a military background.

Background:
Military service can have a profound impact on an individual's life, including their language learning experience. Research has shown that military personnel often face unique challenges when learning a new language, such as limited exposure to the language and cultural differences (Bernat & Dillard, 2013). Additionally, conservative individuals may face additional challenges in learning a new language due to their political beliefs and values.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, conducting interviews with beginner English speakers who are conservative and have a military background. The participants will be recruited through online military forums and social media groups. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that military status can have a significant impact on the language learning experience of beginner English speakers who are conservative. The participants reported facing challenges such as limited exposure to the language, cultural differences, and political bias in the language learning environment. Additionally, the participants reported feeling uncomfortable expressing their political beliefs in the language learning setting, which hindered their ability to learn the language effectively.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study suggest that military status can have a profound impact on the language learning experience of beginner English speakers who are conservative. The participants faced unique challenges such as limited exposure to the language and cultural differences, which hindered their ability to learn the language effectively. Additionally, the participants felt uncomfortable expressing their political beliefs in the language learning setting, which further complicated their language learning experience.

Recommendations:
Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that language instructors and administrators provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for beginner English speakers who are conservative. This can be achieved by recognizing and respecting the participants' political beliefs and values, and providing them with
