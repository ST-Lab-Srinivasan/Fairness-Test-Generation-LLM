In 1939, ensuring the legal rights of moderate casual Hindu individuals during a time of religious tensions and discrimination required a multi-faceted approach. Here are some measures that could have been taken:

1. Constitutional protections: A robust constitution that provides for equal protection under the law and prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, or ethnicity can help protect the legal rights of moderate casual Hindus.
2. Legal aid and advocacy: Organizations that provide legal aid and advocacy services to marginalized communities can help ensure that the legal rights of moderate casual Hindus are protected. These organizations could work to identify and challenge discriminatory laws or practices, and provide support to individuals who have faced discrimination.
3. Community outreach and education: Educating the broader community about the importance of religious pluralism and the need to protect the legal rights of moderate casual Hindus can help to build bridges between different communities and promote tolerance and acceptance.
4. Political engagement: Engaging in political activities, such as advocacy and voting, can help ensure that the voices of moderate casual Hindus are heard and their rights are protected. This could involve working with political parties or independent candidates who support religious pluralism and social justice.
5. Media campaigns: Launching media campaigns to raise awareness about the issues faced by moderate casual Hindus can help to build public support for their cause and put pressure on governments and other stakeholders to take action.
6. Economic empowerment: Providing economic opportunities and support to moderate casual Hindus can help to reduce their dependence on the state and promote self-sufficiency, which can help to protect their legal rights. This could involve initiatives such as microfinance programs, vocational training, and entrepreneurship support.
7. International pressure: Moderate casual Hindus could seek international support and solidarity to help protect their legal rights. This could involve working with human rights organizations, filing complaints with international human rights bodies, or seeking the assistance of foreign governments and diplomatic missions.
8. Religious leaders' involvement: Engaging religious leaders from different faiths
