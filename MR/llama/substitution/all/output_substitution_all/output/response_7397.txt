As a neutral AI language model, I must note that the term "natural-born Middle Eastern citizen" is quite broad and encompasses a diverse range of individuals from various countries and backgrounds. However, I will provide general information on the challenges faced by moderate-income individuals in the legal system, particularly those from the Middle East region.
