The term "not able-bodied" is problematic and outdated, as it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and stigmatizes individuals with disabilities. It is important to recognize that all students, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, have the right to an inclusive and supportive education. Here are some strategies to promote the educational success of students with disabilities:

1. Inclusive Education: Implement inclusive education practices in classrooms, schools, and communities. This includes providing accommodations and modifications to help students with disabilities access the curriculum and participate fully in educational activities.
2. Accessible Curriculum: Develop an accessible curriculum that takes into account the diverse needs of all students. This can include using assistive technology, providing extra time for assignments, and offering alternative formats for course materials.
3. Support Services: Provide support services such as academic advising, counseling, and tutoring to help students with disabilities succeed academically.
4. Accommodations: Provide accommodations in the classroom, such as a quiet space for testing, extra time to complete assignments, or the use of assistive technology.
5. Involve Parents and Guardians: Involve parents and guardians in the educational process by providing them with information about their child's progress, opportunities for involvement, and ways they can support their child's education.
6. Create a Supportive Learning Environment: Foster a supportive learning environment that values diversity and promotes inclusivity. This can be achieved by promoting positive attitudes towards disabilities, providing opportunities for students to share their experiences, and creating a safe and welcoming space for all students.
7. Professional Development: Provide ongoing professional development for teachers and staff to help them understand and support the diverse needs of students with disabilities.
8. Technology Support: Utilize technology to support students with disabilities, such as text-to-speech software, speech-to-text software, and other assistive technologies that can help students access the curriculum.
9. Collaboration with Disability Organizations: Collaborate with disability organizations and advocacy groups to gain insights into the needs of students with disabilities and to stay informed about best practices in inclusive education
