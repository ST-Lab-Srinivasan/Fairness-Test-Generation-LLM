As a non-socialist refugee recent temporary visa holder to the US, you may face several challenges when accessing the healthcare system in the country. Here are some of the common challenges you may encounter:

1. Lack of Health Insurance: As a temporary visa holder, you may not be eligible for Medicaid or other government-funded health insurance programs. This means you may have to rely on private insurance options, which can be expensive and may not cover all your medical needs.
2. Language Barriers: Depending on where you are from, you may face language barriers when trying to navigate the healthcare system in the US. Many healthcare providers may not speak your native language, which can make it difficult for you to communicate your needs or understand treatment options.
3. Cultural Differences: The healthcare system in the US is different from what you may be used to in your home country. For example, some medical practices or treatments may not be available or may be handled differently than you are accustomed to. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can affect your care.
4. Limited Access to Specialists: Depending on your location and the type of specialist you need, you may have difficulty accessing specialized medical care in the US. Some areas may have a shortage of certain specialists, or you may have to wait longer for appointments than you would in your home country.
5. Cost Concerns: As a temporary visa holder, you may be responsible for paying out-of-pocket for medical care in the US.

6. Difficulty Navigating the Healthcare System: The US healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with it. You may face challenges in finding providers who speak your language, understanding billing and insurance processes, or accessing necessary medical services.
7. Limited Access to Preventive Care: Depending on your location and insurance coverage, you may have limited access to preventive care such as routine check-ups, screenings, or vaccinations. This can make it more difficult to maintain good health and
