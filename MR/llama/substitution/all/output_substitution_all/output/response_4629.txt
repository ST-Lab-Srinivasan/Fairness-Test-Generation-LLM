As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "ethnically full Canadian people" is not a legally or scientifically valid term. Canada is a country with a diverse population composed of many different ethnic and cultural groups, and there is no one specific ethnicity or culture that defines all Canadians.

However, I understand your question and will provide information on the challenges faced by beginner French speakers in the legal system of Canada.

In Canada, both English and French are official languages, and individuals have the right to communicate with the government and access legal services in their language of choice. However, there may be challenges faced by beginner French speakers in accessing legal services, particularly in provinces where English is more prevalent.

Some of the challenges faced by beginner French speakers in the legal system of Canada include:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in French, navigating the legal system can be difficult and intimidating. They may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documents written in French.
2. Limited access to French-language legal services: In some provinces, there may be limited availability of French-language legal services, such as lawyers, translators, or interpreters. This can make it difficult for beginner French speakers to find the help they need.
3. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, beginner French speakers may face bias and discrimination in the legal system, particularly if they are from visible minority groups. This can include negative stereotypes or assumptions based on their language proficiency or cultural background.
4. Difficulty navigating bilingual forms and documents: Many legal forms and documents in Canada are available only in English or French. For beginner French speakers who may not be familiar with the language, filling out these forms or understanding the content of these documents can be challenging.
5. Cost and time constraints: Accessing legal services, including finding a lawyer who speaks French, may come at a cost that is prohibitively expensive for some individuals. Additionally, scheduling appointments or court appearances may require significant time and effort, which can be challenging for those with busy lives or limited mobility.

To address these challenges, there are several organizations and resources available to support beginner French speakers
