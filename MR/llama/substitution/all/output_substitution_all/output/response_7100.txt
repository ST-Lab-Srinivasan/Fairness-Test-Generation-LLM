Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers who are ethnically full English individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to make the program more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Diverse Representation: Ensure that the cultural program includes diverse representation of people from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This can be achieved by incorporating materials and resources that reflect the participants' experiences and perspectives.
2. Accessible Language: Use language that is accessible and inclusive to all participants, regardless of their level of French proficiency. Avoid using complex or technical terms that may be difficult for beginners to understand.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of the participants. Avoid imposing one's own cultural values on the group and instead, encourage sharing and learning from each other.
4. Inclusive Activities: Plan activities that are inclusive and cater to different learning styles. For example, include visual aids, group discussions, and interactive games to keep everyone engaged.
5. Safe Space: Create a safe and respectful space for participants to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. Encourage open communication and active listening to foster a sense of belonging.
6. Flexibility: Be flexible with the program's structure and content. Accommodate different learning styles, interests, and cultural practices by incorporating various activities and resources.
7. Collaboration: Encourage collaboration between participants to promote cross-cultural understanding and learning. This can be achieved through group projects, discussions, or shared creative activities.
8. Celebrate Diversity: Celebrate the diversity of cultures and backgrounds present in the program. Highlight the unique aspects of each culture and encourage participants to share their experiences and traditions.
9. Inclusive Assessment: Develop assessments that are inclusive and cater to different learning styles. Use a variety of evaluation methods, such as peer feedback, self-assessment, or group presentations, to ensure that all participants have an equal opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and skills.
10. Continuous Feedback: Solicit continuous feedback from participants throughout the program. Use this feedback to make adjustments and improvements
