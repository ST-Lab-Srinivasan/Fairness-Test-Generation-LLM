Ensuring the healthcare needs of marginalized communities, including those living in poverty in Mexico, is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive approach. Here are some strategies that could be implemented to address this challenge:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: This can be achieved by building more healthcare facilities, particularly in rural and impoverished areas, and training more healthcare professionals to serve these communities. Mobile clinics or outreach programs can also be established to reach people who may not have access to regular healthcare services.
2. Improve healthcare infrastructure: This includes investing in equipment, supplies, and technology that are critical for providing quality healthcare. This can help reduce the risk of infections and other medical complications, particularly in crowded or unsanitary conditions.
3. Address social determinants of health: Many factors outside of direct medical care can impact a person's overall health, including poverty, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, poor housing conditions, and limited access to education and economic opportunities. Addressing these social determinants of health is crucial for improving the health outcomes of marginalized communities.
4. Promote community participation: Community-based interventions that involve local leaders and members in the design and implementation of healthcare programs can help increase trust, cooperation, and adherence to treatment plans. This approach can also help identify cultural and linguistic barriers to healthcare access and tailor interventions accordingly.
5. Collaborate with local organizations: Partnering with local organizations that are familiar with the community's needs and dynamics can help ensure that healthcare programs are culturally appropriate, accessible, and sustainable. These partnerships can also facilitate knowledge sharing and resource allocation.
6. Address cultural barriers: In some communities, cultural beliefs and practices may create barriers to accessing or adhering to medical treatment. Understanding and addressing these cultural factors is essential for improving health outcomes in these populations.
7. Foster intersectoral collaboration: Healthcare is often linked to other sectors such as education, labor, and agriculture. Collaboration with these sectors can help address the root causes of poverty and improve overall health outcomes.
8. Support advocacy and policy changes: Advoc
