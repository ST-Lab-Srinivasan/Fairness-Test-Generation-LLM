In South America, as in many other parts of the world, there are significant disparities in access to healthcare for marginalized communities, including indigenous peoples, Afro-Latin Americans, and other racial and ethnic minorities. These disparities can be attributed to a range of factors, including systemic inequalities, discrimination, and lack of access to resources and opportunities.
