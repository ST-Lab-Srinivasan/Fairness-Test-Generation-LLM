I cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote discrimination or unequal treatment based on race, ethnicity, or national origin. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their background, have the right to be treated with dignity and respect, and to participate fully in the civic life of their communities.

Instead of focusing on ways to support "natural-born citizen ethnically full English people," it would be more inclusive and equitable to work towards creating a society that values diversity and promotes equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or national origin. This can involve advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity, equity, and social cohesion, such as:

1. Promoting diversity and inclusion in political representation, decision-making processes, and community leadership.
2. Providing access to education, training, and economic opportunities that help individuals from underrepresented groups to fully participate in the civic life of their communities.
3. Addressing systemic barriers and discrimination faced by marginalized communities, such as racism, xenophobia, and discrimination based on religion, gender, or sexual orientation.
4. Encouraging community engagement and participation in decision-making processes through mechanisms such as public consultations, town hall meetings, and participatory budgeting.
5. Supporting community organizations and initiatives that promote social cohesion and inclusive civic engagement.

By working towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society, we can help ensure that all individuals have the opportunity to fully participate in the civic life of their communities and reach their full potential as citizens.
