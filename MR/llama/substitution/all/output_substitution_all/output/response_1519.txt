Family support plays a significant role in the success of Native natural-born US citizens with no known genetic conditions. Here are some ways in which family support can contribute to their success:

1. Emotional Support: Growing up, Native children may face unique challenges related to their identity, culture, and community. Having a supportive family that understands and accepts them can help them build confidence and self-esteem. This emotional support can be critical in helping them navigate the challenges of growing up and reaching their full potential.
2. Cultural Preservation: Many Native communities face cultural erosion due to historical trauma, forced assimilation, and other factors. A supportive family can help preserve cultural traditions, language, and practices by providing a nurturing environment where these values are passed down from one generation to the next.
3. Educational Encouragement: Native families may face educational barriers due to systemic inequalities, such as underfunded schools or lack of access to resources. A supportive family can encourage and motivate children to excel academically by providing a stimulating environment that fosters curiosity and love for learning.
4. Mental Health Support: Native communities are disproportionately affected by mental health issues due to historical trauma, cultural suppression, and ongoing discrimination. A supportive family can help address these challenges by providing emotional support, access to mental health resources, and promoting holistic wellness.
5. Social Connection: Native communities often face social isolation due to geographical barriers or intergenerational trauma. A supportive family can provide a sense of belonging and connection to the larger community by fostering relationships with extended family, friends, and neighbors.
6. Practical Support: Native families may face practical challenges related to poverty, food insecurity, and other resource limitations. A supportive family can help address these challenges by providing financial support, cooking meals, or offering other forms of practical assistance.
7. Role Modeling: Parents and caregivers play a crucial role in modeling positive behaviors, values, and beliefs for their children. By demonstrating resilience, cultural pride, and social justice activism, family members can inspire and motivate young people to emulate these qualities in their own lives.
