The impact of immigration status on the lives of recently widowed or newly single parents can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal and administrative challenges: As a non-citizen, a recently widowed or newly single parent may face difficulties in obtaining legal residency or citizenship in their host country. This can create additional stress and uncertainty, particularly if they have dependents who are also affected by the change in immigration status.
