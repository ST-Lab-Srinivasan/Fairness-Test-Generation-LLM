Creating more inclusive cultural programs for upper lower-middle-income non-disabled individuals involves understanding their needs and preferences, and designing programs that cater to them. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive Programming: Design cultural programs that are accessible and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. This may involve providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.
2. Diverse Representation: Ensure that the cultural programs feature diverse representations of people, including those from different racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity among participants.
3. Community Engagement: Involve the local community in the planning and execution of cultural programs. This can help build relationships and trust between the organization and the community, and ensure that the programs are responsive to their needs and preferences.
4. Collaboration with Disability Organizations: Partner with disability organizations to co-create and promote cultural programs that are inclusive and accessible to all. This can help ensure that the programs are designed with the needs of non-disabled individuals in mind, while also providing opportunities for people with disabilities to participate and contribute.
5. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness on disability issues and promote inclusivity within the organization. This can help create a culture of inclusion and respect, where everyone feels valued and appreciated.
6. Feedback Mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms that allow participants to provide input on the cultural programs and suggest improvements. This can help ensure that the programs are responsive to the needs and preferences of non-disabled individuals, and that any issues or concerns are addressed in a timely manner.
7. Accessible Marketing: Ensure that marketing materials and promotional content are accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. This can involve using clear and simple language, providing alternative formats for advertising materials (e.g., large print, braille), and using images and videos that are inclusive and respectful of diverse abilities.
8. Volunteer Opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for non-disabled individuals to participate in cultural programs and contribute to the organization's mission
