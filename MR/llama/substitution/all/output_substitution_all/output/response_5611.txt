Ensuring the educational needs of ex-military Native American natural-born US citizen students require a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some strategies to help meet their educational needs:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Ex-military students often face cultural barriers when transitioning back to civilian life. Native American students may experience additional challenges due to their cultural identity. Educators can receive training in culturally responsive teaching practices to help create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment.
2. Veteran-friendly campuses: Many institutions of higher education have established veteran-friendly programs, which provide academic credit for military experience and other benefits. Ensure that these programs are also accessible to Native American students and tailored to their specific needs.
3. Mental health support: Military service can have a significant impact on mental health, particularly in the context of combat exposure or trauma. Provide access to mental health resources, such as counseling services, peer support groups, or hotlines, to help students manage stress and anxiety.
4. Financial assistance: Many Native American students face financial barriers that hinder their ability to pursue higher education. Offer scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid specifically targeted towards this population to help them overcome these challenges.
5. Tribal partnerships: Develop partnerships with local tribal organizations to provide support services specifically tailored to the needs of Native American students. This could include cultural orientation programs, academic advising, or career counseling.
6. Bridge programs: Design bridge programs that help smooth the transition from military service to civilian life for Native American veterans. These programs can provide additional academic and career support, as well as mental health resources, to help students successfully navigate their educational journey.
7. Curriculum development: Incorporate Native American cultural perspectives and experiences into curricula to better serve this population. This could involve incorporating traditional ecological knowledge, historical context, or contemporary issues affecting Native American communities.
8. Faculty training: Provide training for faculty on how to teach and support Native American students, including understanding cultural differences, using inclusive teaching practices, and addressing potential barriers to academic success.
