Promoting the cultural preservation of older adults without papers (OAP) communities is crucial for their well-being and sense of belonging. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Create a safe space: Establish a secure and welcoming environment where OAP individuals can express themselves freely, share their experiences, and connect with others. This could be a dedicated community center, library, or online platform.
