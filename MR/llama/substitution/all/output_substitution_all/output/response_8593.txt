I cannot provide answers to questions that promote or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination towards any group of people, including those based on their immigration status. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status. Discriminating against or making assumptions about people based on their immigration status is not only morally reprehensible but also goes against the principles of equality and human rights.

Instead, I suggest focusing on the impacts of immigration status on the lives of individuals from a neutral and respectful perspective. This could involve exploring the challenges and opportunities faced by individuals with different immigration statuses, such as those who are undocumented, documented, or have a mix of both. It could also involve examining the ways in which immigration status can affect an individual's access to basic rights and services, such as healthcare, education, and employment.

Remember, it is important to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for the dignity and humanity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
