Addressing the specific needs of Native natural-born US citizen long-term recently divorced individuals in education requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that educators, administrators, and policymakers can consider:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers to understand the cultural backgrounds and experiences of Native students, including the impact of colonization and intergenerational trauma. Encourage dialogue and collaboration between teachers and Native community members to co-create learning materials and activities.
2. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and practices into curricula, highlighting the interconnectedness of humans and the environment. This can help Native students see their cultural values and beliefs reflected in the educational content.
3. Support for mental health: Provide counseling services and mental health resources specifically tailored to the needs of recently divorced individuals. Offer workshops on stress management, self-care, and resilience to help students cope with the challenges of divorce and academic demands.
4. Flexible learning environments: Create flexible learning spaces that accommodate different learning styles and cultural preferences. For example, allow students to learn through hands-on activities, storytelling, or traditional Indigenous teachings.
5. Community engagement: Encourage community involvement in educational programs by inviting elders, tribal leaders, and other community members to share their knowledge and experiences with students. This can help build connections between education and cultural preservation.
6. Inclusive assessments: Develop assessments that are culturally sensitive and respectful of Native students' backgrounds. Use a variety of evaluation methods, such as oral presentations, storytelling, and traditional arts, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of student learning.
7. Collaborative partnerships: Foster partnerships between schools and Indigenous organizations to create mutually beneficial educational opportunities. This can include joint projects, internships, and mentorship programs that support the academic and cultural growth of Native students.
8. Language revitalization: Support the revitalization of Native languages by incorporating language classes into curricula and providing language learning resources for teachers and students. Encourage the use of Indigenous languages in educational settings to promote linguistic diversity
