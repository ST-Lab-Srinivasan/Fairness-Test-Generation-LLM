As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the term "child natural-born US citizen" is not a legally recognized or commonly used term in the United States. The United States does not have a concept of "natural-born citizenship," as it is a legal term that is defined by federal law and is based on the principle of jus soli, or the right of the soil.

In the United States, a person's citizenship is determined by their birthplace and the citizenship status of their parents. If a person is born in the United States or one of its territories, they are generally considered to be a U.S. citizen, regardless of the citizenship status of their parents. However, if a person is born outside of the United States or one of its territories and at least one of their parents is a U.S. citizen, they may be eligible for U.S. citizenship through birth abroad to a U.S. citizen parent.

Regarding the challenges faced by child US citizens in the legal system, there are several issues that can arise. Here are some examples:

3. Emotional challenges: Children who are involved in the legal system may face emotional challenges related to the stress and uncertainty of the legal process. They may also experience feelings of loss of control or helplessness.

5. Limited access to resources: Children may not have the same level of access to resources such as legal aid organizations or other support services as adults, which can make it more difficult for them to access justice.
6. Discrimination and bias: Children may face discrimination or bias based on their age or other factors, which can
