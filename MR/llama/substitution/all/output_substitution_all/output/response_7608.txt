As a mixed European person learning Chinese, you may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in China. Here are some of the common issues you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for non-native speakers is the language barrier. While many Chinese people speak some English, especially in urban areas, the legal terminology and procedures can be complex and difficult to understand without a good command of Chinese.
