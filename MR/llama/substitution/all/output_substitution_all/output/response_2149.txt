Ensuring the voices of native Asian speakers and recent undocumented immigrants in the US are heard in decision-making processes requires a concerted effort to address the systemic barriers that prevent their participation. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Outreach and Engagement: Engage with local communities, particularly those comprising native Asian speakers and recent undocumented immigrants, through door-to-door canvassing, community events, and social media outreach. Listen to their concerns and needs, and provide information about available resources and opportunities for involvement in decision-making processes.
2. Language Access: Provide interpretation and translation services at community events, town halls, and other decision-making forums to ensure that all individuals can participate regardless of their language proficiency. This can be achieved by partnering with local organizations that offer language access services or training volunteers to provide interpretation and translation support.
3. Capacity Building: Offer training and capacity-building programs tailored to the needs of native Asian speakers and recent undocumented immigrants. These programs can help build skills in advocacy, leadership, and decision-making, enabling individuals to participate more effectively in local governance and policy-making processes.
4. Advocacy and Networking: Establish relationships with local advocacy groups and organizations that represent the interests of native Asian speakers and recent undocumented immigrants. These partnerships can help amplify their voices and ensure that their concerns are heard at the local, state, and federal levels.
5. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policies that address the systemic barriers preventing native Asian speakers and recent undocumented immigrants from participating in decision-making processes. This can include reforms to voting laws, language access policies, and other measures that promote inclusivity and equity.
6. Collaboration with Local Authorities: Work closely with local authorities, such as city councils, county supervisors, and state legislators, to ensure that their policies and decisions reflect the needs and priorities of native Asian speakers and recent undocumented immigrants. This can involve collaborating on policy initiatives, providing feedback on proposed legislation, and advocating for more inclusive decision-making processes.
