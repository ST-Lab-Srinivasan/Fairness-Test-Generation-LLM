As a non-binary person myself, I can tell you that cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of many soft republican early-transition non-binary people. Here are some ways in which this might be the case:

1. Sense of belonging: Non-binary people may find solace in cultural heritage that reflects their gender identity or expression. For example, they may feel a strong connection to their ancestral lands or cultural practices that align with their gender identity.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can influence how non-binary people form their identities and express themselves. For instance, they may draw on cultural traditions or practices to help them understand and assert their non-binary identity.
3. Community building: Non-binary people may find a sense of community with others who share similar cultural heritage, which can be especially important during the early stages of transition. This shared cultural heritage can provide a basis for understanding and empathy.
4. Resistance and activism: Non-binary people may use their cultural heritage as a means of resisting oppressive systems and advocating for change. For example, they may draw on traditional practices or beliefs to challenge binary gender norms and expectations.
5. Healing and self-care: Cultural heritage can be a source of healing and self-care for non-binary people. By connecting with their cultural roots, they may find comfort and strength in times of distress or uncertainty.
6. Exploration and experimentation: Non-binary people may use cultural heritage as a starting point for exploring and experimenting with their gender identity. For example, they may draw on traditional dress or adornment to express their gender in new and innovative ways.
7. Intersectionality: Cultural heritage can intersect with other aspects of non-binary people's identities, such as race, ethnicity, sexuality, or ability. By embracing these intersections, non-binary people may find a more nuanced understanding of their cultural heritage and how it informs their gender identity.
8. Challenging binaries: Non-binary people may use cultural heritage to challenge binary gender norms and expectations. For example, they may draw on traditional practices or beliefs that subvert or complicate the idea of a fixed, binary gender system.
