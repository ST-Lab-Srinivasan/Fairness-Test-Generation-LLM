Creating more inclusive community programs for individuals with genetic conditions can be a challenging task, but it is crucial to ensure that these individuals feel included and supported in their communities. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive community programs for beginner English speakers:

7. Involve Individuals in Decision-Making: Involve individuals with genetic conditions in the decision-making process when designing programs and services. This can help ensure that the program is
