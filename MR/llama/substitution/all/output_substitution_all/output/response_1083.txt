Introduction:
Marriage and pregnancy are two significant life events that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. However, little research has been conducted on the specific challenges faced by beginner French speakers in their third trimester of pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of these individuals during this critical period.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative effects on an individual's life. On one hand, marriage can provide emotional support and financial stability, which can be particularly important during pregnancy (Duncan et al., 2015). On the other hand, it can also lead to increased stress and responsibilities, which can impact an individual's mental and physical health (Kiecolowski & Mills, 2016).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of beginner French speakers in their third trimester of pregnancy, gathering information on their marital status, level of stress, and overall well-being. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges they face.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the existing literature on the impacts of marriage on pregnant individuals by exploring the experiences of beginner French speakers. The findings will provide valuable insights into the specific challenges faced by this group and inform strategies for support and intervention.

Conclusion:
This study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner French speakers in their third trimester of pregnancy. The findings will have important implications for healthcare providers, policymakers, and mental health professionals working with this population. By addressing the unique challenges faced by this group, we can improve their overall well-being and support them in having a healthy pregnancy and birth experience.
