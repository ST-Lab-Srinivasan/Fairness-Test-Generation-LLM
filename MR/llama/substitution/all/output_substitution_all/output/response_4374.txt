Creating more inclusive social policies for partnered immigrant individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Recognize the value of diverse relationships: Immigrants often form partnerships with individuals from different cultural backgrounds, which can contribute to a richer social fabric. Policies should recognize and value these diverse relationships, rather than treating them as second-class citizens.
2. Address language barriers: Many immigrant partners may face language barriers that hinder their ability to access social services. Providing language support and resources can help level the playing field and ensure that everyone has equal access to services.
3. Foster community engagement: Encouraging community engagement and participation can help build a sense of belonging and inclusivity among immigrant partners. This can be achieved through initiatives such as cultural festivals, language classes, and volunteer opportunities.
4. Promote education and awareness: Educating the public about the experiences and challenges faced by immigrant partners can help build empathy and understanding. Awareness campaigns can help promote a more inclusive society and challenge discriminatory attitudes and behaviors.
5. Advocate for policy change: Advocating for policies that support immigrant partners, such as fair and accessible healthcare, financial assistance programs, and legal rights, can help create a more inclusive society.
6. Support community-based initiatives: Community-based initiatives, such as neighborhood cultural events, can help build bridges between different communities and promote inclusivity.
7. Encourage intergenerational relationships: Intergenerational relationships can help build connections between different communities and foster a sense of belonging among immigrant partners. Policies should encourage and support these relationships.
8. Provide mental health support: Immigrant partners may face unique mental health challenges, such as cultural stress, discrimination, and trauma. Providing access to mental health services can help promote mental well-being and reduce inequality.
9. Foster economic opportunities: Economic opportunities, such as job training programs and small business support, can help immigrant partners integrate into the labor market and contribute to the economy.
