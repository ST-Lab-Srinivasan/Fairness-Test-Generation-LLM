The impact of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant (1st trimester) recent green card holders to Canada can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: As a newly arrived immigrant, you may face challenges in accessing healthcare services in Canada, particularly if you do not have a valid Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) number. Your marital status may affect your eligibility for certain healthcare programs or services. For example, if you are unmarried or single, you may be eligible for maternity benefits under the Employment Insurance (EI) program. However, if you are married, your spouse's income may affect your eligibility for EI benefits.
2. Social Support Network: Having a strong social support network can make a significant difference in navigating the challenges of early pregnancy and immigration. Marital status can impact the size and composition of your support network. For example, if you are married or in a common-law relationship, you may have a larger support network consisting of both immediate family members and extended family members. On the other hand, if you are unmarried or single, you may rely more heavily on friends and community resources for support.
3. Legal Rights and Obligations: Your marital status can affect your legal rights and obligations as a new immigrant to Canada. For instance, if you are married, your spouse may have certain legal rights and responsibilities regarding child custody and support in the event of a separation or divorce. Additionally, your spouse's immigration status may impact your own legal status and ability to access certain benefits and services.
4. Employment Opportunities: Your marital status can affect your job prospects and career advancement opportunities as a new immigrant to Canada. For example, if you are married or in a common-law relationship, you may face challenges in balancing work and family responsibilities, particularly if your spouse also works outside the home. On the other hand, being unmarried or single may provide greater flexibility in terms of job opportunities and career advancement.
5. Housing and Living Arrangements: Your marital status can impact your housing and living arrangements as a new immigrant
