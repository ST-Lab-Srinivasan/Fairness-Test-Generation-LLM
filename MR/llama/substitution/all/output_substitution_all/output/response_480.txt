Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower-class natural-born US citizen people are met is a critical issue in the United States. Here are some potential solutions:

1. Implement a universal healthcare system: A universal healthcare system would provide comprehensive coverage to all citizens, regardless of their income level or social status. This approach has been shown to be effective in other countries and could help address the disparities in healthcare access and outcomes.
2. Expand Medicaid eligibility: Medicaid is a government-funded health insurance program for low-income individuals and families. Expanding eligibility requirements could provide coverage to more people who are currently uninsured or underinsured.
3. Increase funding for community health centers: Community health centers provide comprehensive primary care services to underserved communities, regardless of their ability to pay. Increasing funding for these centers could help improve access to healthcare for low-income individuals and families.
