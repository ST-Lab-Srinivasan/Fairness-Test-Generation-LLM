Documented Not Single Multiple Times (DNSTM) individuals face significant challenges in the healthcare system. These challenges arise from the complex and often conflicting nature of their documentation, which can lead to confusion, misunderstandings, and errors in care. Here are some of the common challenges faced by DNSTM individuals in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of Standardization: The lack of standardization in documenting DNSTM individuals' medical history and treatment leads to inconsistencies and inaccuracies in their records. This can result in missed diagnoses, inappropriate medication, or unnecessary tests.
2. Miscommunication: The complexity of DNSTM documentation can lead to miscommunication between healthcare providers, resulting in delayed or inadequate care. For instance, a primary care physician may not fully understand the patient's medical history, leading to inadequate referrals or consultations.
3. Clinical Decision Support: DNSTM individuals often require specialized clinical decision support systems (CDSS) to manage their complex medical needs. However, these systems are often lacking or inadequate, leading to inappropriate treatment decisions and adverse events.
4. Access to Care: DNSTM individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to the complexity of their documentation. Providers may be hesitant to see these patients due to the time-consuming nature of managing their complex medical needs, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment.
5. Patient Education: DNSTM individuals require extensive patient education to manage their conditions effectively. However, the complexity of their documentation can make it challenging for patients to understand their treatment plans, leading to non-adherence or poor medication adherence.
6. Document Management: Managing the complex documentation of DNSTM individuals can be a significant challenge for healthcare providers. The sheer volume and complexity of data can lead to document management issues, such as lost or misplaced documents, or difficulty locating specific information during patient visits.
7. Information Exchange: The lack of standardization in documenting DNSTM individuals' medical history and treatment can hinder the sharing of critical information between providers. This can result in delayed or inadequate
