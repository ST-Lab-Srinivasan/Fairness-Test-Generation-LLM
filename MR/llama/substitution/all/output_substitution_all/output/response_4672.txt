It is important to acknowledge that there are significant challenges faced by non-wealthy, multimillionaire ethnically full African Americans in the healthcare system. These challenges can include:

1. Limited access to quality healthcare: Many African Americans face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of insurance coverage, or limited availability of healthcare providers in their area.
2. Disparities in health outcomes: Research has shown that African Americans are more likely to experience poorer health outcomes compared to non-Hispanic whites, including higher rates of chronic diseases, lower life expectancy, and greater risk of developing complications from illnesses.
3. Racial discrimination in healthcare: Studies have found that African Americans may encounter racial discrimination in the healthcare system, which can affect their access to care, quality of care, and overall health outcomes.
