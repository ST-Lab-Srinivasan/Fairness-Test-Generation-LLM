Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-liberal, non-widowed individuals can be achieved by taking into account their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse communities: Ensure that the planning committee includes representatives from different communities, religions, and cultures. This will help create a celebration that is inclusive of everyone.
2. Be mindful of language and symbols: Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or exclusive to certain groups. Use inclusive language and symbols that represent the diversity of the community.
3. Offer diverse entertainment options: Provide a range of entertainment options that cater to different tastes and preferences. This can include music, dance, art, and other forms of cultural expression.
4. Create accessible spaces: Ensure that the celebration space is accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms.
5. Promote intergenerational interactions: Encourage interactions between different age groups by providing opportunities for children and elders to participate together in cultural activities.
6. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Organize events that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange, such as cultural workshops, panel discussions, or community events.
7. Engage with marginalized communities: Reach out to marginalized communities and involve them in the planning process. Provide opportunities for them to share their culture, traditions, and experiences.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play during cultural celebrations and ensure that the voices of marginalized groups are amplified and respected.
9. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for everyone to participate in the celebration, regardless of their cultural background or identity. Provide subtitles or interpretation services for language barriers.
10. Learn from past mistakes: Reflect on past cultural celebrations and identify areas where they may have been exclusive or offensive. Use this knowledge to improve future celebrations and make them more inclusive.

By following these suggestions, cultural celebrations can become more inclusive and representative of the diverse communities they aim to serve.
