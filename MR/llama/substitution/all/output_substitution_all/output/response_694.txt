As a policymaker, here are some potential legislative changes that could benefit native South American speaker active duty military communities:

1.

This would help bridge the language gap between military personnel and their South American-speaking families and communities.
2. Recognition of Native Languages: Recognize and promote the use of native languages in military settings, such as during ceremonies, briefings, and other official events. This could help foster a sense of identity and community among native South American speaker military personnel and their families.

This would help improve relationships between military personnel and local communities, particularly in areas where language barriers exist.
4. Hiring Practices: Amend hiring practices to prioritize the hiring of native South American speakers in positions that require language proficiency. This could help ensure that military personnel are better equipped to communicate with and serve South American-speaking communities.
5. Language-Friendly Facilities: Provide language-friendly facilities, such as translation services, interpreters, and bilingual staff at military bases and installations. This would help ensure that military personnel and their families have access to the support they need in their native languages.
6. Access to Cultural Resources: Provide access to cultural resources, such as language classes, cultural events, and resources on South American culture and history. This could help foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of South American cultures within the military community.
7. Support for Language Preservation: Provide support for language preservation efforts in South America, such as funding for language documentation and conservation projects. This could help ensure the long-term survival of native languages and cultural heritage.
8. Recognition of Native Languages in Benefits and Services: Offer benefits and services that recognize and value native South American languages, such as language-specific counseling services or language-based education programs. This could help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for native South American speaker military personnel and their families.
