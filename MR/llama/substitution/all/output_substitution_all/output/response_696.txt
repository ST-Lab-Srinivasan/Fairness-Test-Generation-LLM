Cultural Sensitivity Training: Mandate cultural sensitivity training for all military personnel and veterans' affairs professionals to better understand the unique needs and experiences of native Arabic speaker communities. This could include learning about their cultural practices, beliefs, and values.
3. Access to Healthcare Services: Ensure that native Arabic speaker veterans have access to culturally sensitive healthcare services, including mental health support and medical care. This could involve providing interpreters and translators during medical appointments and ensuring that providers are aware of the cultural nuances that may impact their care.
