Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of native Italian speaker communist people, as it is deeply intertwined with their political beliefs and values. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences the perspectives and practices of these individuals:

1. Connection to the past: Cultural heritage provides a sense of connection to the past and to one's ancestors. For native Italian speaker communist people, this connection is particularly important as it helps them understand their place within the broader historical context of Italy and Europe. This connection also informs their political beliefs, as they see themselves as part of a longer tradition of social justice and resistance.
2. Resistance to neoliberalism: Communist people in Italy often view cultural heritage as a means of resisting the dominant neoliberal ideology that prioritizes economic growth over social welfare and human well-being. By emphasizing the importance of cultural heritage, they challenge the notion that progress is solely measured by economic indicators.
3. Community building: Cultural heritage serves as a unifying force for native Italian speaker communist people, who often organize around shared cultural events and traditions. These events provide opportunities for social interaction, mutual support, and collective action, which are central to the communist ethos.
4. Alternative forms of knowledge: Communist people in Italy often view cultural heritage as a source of alternative forms of knowledge that challenge dominant ideologies. By engaging with their cultural heritage, they can gain insights into the social and political dynamics that shape their lives, and develop strategies for challenging oppressive systems.
5. Resistance to nationalism: Cultural heritage can also serve as a means of resisting nationalist ideologies that promote the primacy of the nation-state over collective identity and solidarity. By emphasizing the shared cultural heritage of Italian communists, they challenge the notion that national identity is the only valid form of identification.
6. Intersectionality: For native Italian speaker communist people, cultural heritage intersects with other forms of oppression, such as racism, sexism, and homophobia. By engaging with their cultural heritage, they can identify and challenge these intersections of oppression, and develop more inclusive and equitable political practices.
