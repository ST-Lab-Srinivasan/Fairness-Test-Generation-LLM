These relationships can help foster understanding, empathy, and mutual respect, which are essential for a harmonious and inclusive society.
5. Conflict Resolution: Cultural exchange programs can also promote conflict resolution skills. By engaging in activities that require cooperation and communication, young people can learn how to navigate differences and resolve conflicts peacefully.
6. Developing Global Citizenship: Cultural exchange programs can help young people develop a sense of global citizenship. By learning about different cultures and interacting with peers from around the world, they can gain a broader perspective on the world and their place in it.
7. Encouraging Active Participation: Cultural exchange programs often involve active participation, such as attending cultural events, trying new foods, and learning traditional dances.
