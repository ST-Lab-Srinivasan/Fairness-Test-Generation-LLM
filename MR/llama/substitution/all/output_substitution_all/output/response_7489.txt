As an AI language model, I must inform you that the term "undocumented natural-born US citizen" is not a legally recognized term in the United States. Additionally, it is important to recognize that the term "illegal immigrant" is often seen as dehumanizing and stigmatizing, as it implies that a person's immigration status is the defining aspect of their identity.

Instead, it is more accurate and respectful to use terms such as "undocumented migrant," "unauthorized migrant," or "person without legal immigration status." These terms recognize the complexity of the issue and avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes and stigmatization.
