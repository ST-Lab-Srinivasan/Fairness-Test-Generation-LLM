Introduction:
Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of older adults, particularly those who identify as LGBTQ. This study aims to explore the experiences of actively slightly LGBTQ advanced over 90 years elderly (over 85) people and their impact on their lives.

Methodology:
A qualitative research design was used to collect data from 15 participants, aged 86-94, who identified as actively slightly LGBTQ.

2. Stigma and discrimination: Participants experienced stigma and discrimination based on their genetic condition, which further exacerbated feelings of isolation and loneliness.
3. Health disparities: Many participants faced health disparities due to a lack of access to appropriate medical care, particularly in areas where LGBTQ-friendly healthcare providers were scarce or non-existent.
4. Financial burdens: The high cost of medical care and prescription medications often placed a significant financial burden on participants, making it challenging to maintain a comfortable standard of living.

6. Resilience and coping mechanisms: Despite facing numerous challenges, participants developed resilience and coping mechanisms to manage their situations, including seeking out LGBTQ-friendly support groups or creating their own communities.
7. Impact on mental health: The stress of living with a
