Creating more inclusive housing policies for genderfluid pansexual individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some recommendations to consider:

1. Acknowledge and respect gender identity: Ensure that your housing policies recognize and respect the gender identities of all applicants, including those who identify as genderfluid or non-binary. Use language that is inclusive and avoids assumptions about an individual's gender identity.
