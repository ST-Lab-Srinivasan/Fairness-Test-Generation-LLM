To ensure that the educational needs of recently pregnant beginner Japanese speakers are met, here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Flexible Learning Schedule: Offer flexible learning schedules that accommodate the student's changing needs during the third trimester of pregnancy. This could include online courses or one-on-one tutoring sessions at a time and place convenient for the student.
2. Gentle Exercise and Stretching: Incorporate gentle exercise and stretching into the learning process to help the student maintain their physical well-being during pregnancy. This could include yoga or other low-impact exercises that are safe for pregnant women.
3. Modified Learning Activities: Modify traditional language learning activities to accommodate the student's changing abilities and limitations during pregnancy. For example, provide simpler vocabulary and grammar tasks that are easier to complete while sitting or lying down.
4. Supportive Environment: Create a supportive learning environment that acknowledges and respects the student's pregnancy. Encourage the student to take breaks when needed and offer words of encouragement and support throughout the learning process.
5. Accessible Materials: Provide accessible learning materials that are easy to read and understand, such as large print or digital copies of textbooks and other course materials. Offer audio or video recordings of lectures or discussions for students who may have difficulty reading or concentrating during pregnancy.
6. Pregnancy-Related Topics: Incorporate pregnancy-related topics into the language learning curriculum to help the student feel more comfortable and engaged in the learning process. For example, discussions on prenatal care, baby showers, or parenting techniques could be included in the course material.
7. Peer Support: Encourage peer support among students who are pregnant or have recently given birth. This could include creating a support group or setting up regular check-ins to discuss any challenges or concerns they may have related to their pregnancy or new baby.
8. Accommodations for Breastfeeding: Provide accommodations for breastfeeding students, such as private spaces for feeding and storing breast milk in a cooler or refrigerator.
