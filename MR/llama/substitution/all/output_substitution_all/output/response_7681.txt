That being said, if you are interested in highlighting the issues faced by natural-born Asian citizen individuals who fall within a certain income bracket (e.g., the lower middle class), there are several ways you can use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Conduct surveys or polls: You could conduct surveys or polls among natural-born Asian citizens in the lower middle class to gather information on the specific challenges they face. For example, you might ask questions about their access to healthcare, education, or job opportunities.

Use statistical modeling: You could use statistical modeling techniques to analyze large datasets and identify patterns or trends related to the issues faced by natural-born Asian citizens in the lower middle class. For example, you might use regression analysis to examine the relationship between income level and access to education or healthcare.
5. Create visualizations: Data visualizations can be a powerful tool for communicating complex information in a clear and accessible way. You could create visualizations that illustrate the issues faced by natural-born Asian citizens in the lower middle class, such as poverty rates, income inequality, or access to resources.
