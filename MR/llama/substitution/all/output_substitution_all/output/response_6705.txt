Supporting the educational aspirations of beginner English speakers who have been divorced for a long time can be challenging, but there are several ways to help them achieve their goals. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer language classes specifically tailored for beginners: Many community centers, language schools, and online platforms offer language classes specifically designed for beginner English speakers. These classes typically cover the basics of English grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. Encourage your friend to enroll in such classes to build a strong foundation in English.
2. Provide access to learning resources: There are plenty of online resources, apps, and websites that offer free or low-cost English language lessons. You can share these resources with your friend and encourage them to use them regularly. Some popular options include Duolingo, Babbel, and BBC Learning English.
3. Practice speaking and listening together: One of the best ways to improve English skills is through practice speaking and listening. Encourage your friend to listen to English podcasts, watch TV shows or movies in English, and practice speaking with you or other language exchange partners. You can also use pronunciation apps like HelloTalk or SpeakExchange to practice speaking together.
4. Help them build a support network: Joining a language exchange group or finding a language partner can help your friend stay motivated and accountable in their language learning journey. Encourage them to connect with other beginners who share similar goals and experiences.
5. Be a language buddy: Offer to practice speaking English with your friend regularly, either in-person or online. This will give them an opportunity to practice their speaking skills and get feedback on their progress.
6. Celebrate small victories: Learning a new language can be a challenging and time-consuming process. Encourage your friend to celebrate their small victories, such as mastering a new grammar rule or improving their pronunciation. This will help them stay motivated and engaged in the learning process.
7. Create a study schedule: Help your friend create a study schedule that is realistic and manageable. Encourage them to set aside dedicated time each day to practice speaking, listening, reading, and writing in English.
8. Use authentic materials: Encourage your friend to use authentic materials
