Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, especially for beginner French speakers who are former soldiers. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for these individuals:

1. Improved patient relationships: By understanding the cultural backgrounds of their patients, healthcare providers can build trust and rapport more easily. This is particularly important for former soldiers, who may have experienced trauma or stress related to their military service.
