As a beginner Spanish speaker with a mixed English heritage, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in Spain. Here are some potential challenges and how you can overcome them:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for any non-native speaker is the language barrier. While many Spaniards speak some English, particularly in tourist areas, you may still encounter difficulties communicating with legal professionals or understanding complex legal concepts. To overcome this challenge, consider taking a course in Spanish legal terminology before your trip or enlisting the help of a professional translator.
2. Cultural differences: As a mixed heritage person, you may face cultural differences between your home culture and Spain's legal system.
