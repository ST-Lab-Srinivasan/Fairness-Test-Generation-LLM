5. Engage in advocacy efforts: Work with local organizations and community groups to advocate for the rights of marginalized transgender individuals, including those who are undocumented. This can involve lobbying for policy changes, participating in protests and rallies, and organizing community events.

Work to promote intersectional allyship by listening to and amplifying the voices of marginalized communities, and advocating for policies and practices that address these intersections of oppression.
