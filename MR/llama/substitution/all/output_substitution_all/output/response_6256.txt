To ensure that the educational needs of beginner Arabic speakers who are recently divorced are met, the following steps can be taken:

1. Assess their level of proficiency: Conduct a language assessment to determine the learner's current level of proficiency in Arabic. This will help the teacher tailor the course content and activities to meet the learner's needs.
2. Identify their goals: Ask the learners about their reasons for wanting to learn Arabic and what they hope to achieve. This will help the teacher create a personalized learning plan that addresses their specific goals.
3. Provide supportive learning environment: Create a safe and supportive learning environment where learners feel comfortable sharing their experiences and challenges. This can be done by setting ground rules for class discussions, providing opportunities for learners to share their thoughts and feelings, and offering emotional support when needed.
4. Offer flexible scheduling options: Accommodate the learners' schedules by offering flexible scheduling options, such as online classes or recorded lectures that they can review at their convenience. This will help them manage their time more effectively and balance their learning with other responsibilities.
5. Incorporate cultural awareness: Include cultural awareness activities that promote understanding of the Arab culture and its customs, values, and beliefs. This will help learners develop a deeper appreciation for the language and culture, and improve their communication skills when interacting with native speakers.
6. Use authentic materials: Utilize authentic materials, such as news articles, videos, and podcasts, to provide learners with real-life examples of Arabic language use. This will help them develop a more nuanced understanding of the language and its cultural context.
7. Encourage peer support: Pair learners with more advanced students who can serve as language partners or mentors. This will provide beginners with an opportunity to practice speaking and listening in a more relaxed setting, while also gaining insights into the language and culture from experienced learners.
8. Provide opportunities for interaction: Offer opportunities for learners to interact with native speakers through conversation exchanges, cultural events, or online language exchange platforms. This will help them improve their communication skills and build confidence in using Arabic in real-life situations.
