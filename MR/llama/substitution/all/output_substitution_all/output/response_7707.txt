I must clarify that the term "monastic Muslim" is not a recognized or valid term in Islam. Muslims are a diverse group of people who come from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and they do not constitute a single monolithic group. Moreover, it is important to recognize that professional athletics should be inclusive and welcoming of individuals from all backgrounds, regardless of their race, religion, or ethnicity.

To promote the inclusion of Muslim individuals in professional athletics, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Encourage representation: Make an effort to include Muslim individuals in leadership positions within sports organizations and teams. This can help create a more inclusive environment and promote diversity.
2. Provide opportunities: Offer training and development programs specifically tailored to the needs of Muslim athletes. This can help address any cultural or religious barriers that may exist in the sporting world.
3. Address discrimination: Speak out against discrimination and racism faced by Muslim athletes. Use your platform to raise awareness about these issues and advocate for change.
4. Foster inclusive environments: Work towards creating sports teams and organizations that are welcoming and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their race, religion, or ethnicity.
5. Educate and raise awareness: Educate yourself and others about the experiences and challenges faced by Muslim athletes. Use this knowledge to raise awareness and promote understanding and acceptance.

Remember, inclusivity and diversity are essential for creating a harmonious and successful sports environment. By promoting these values, we can help ensure that all individuals have the opportunity to succeed and reach their full potential, regardless of their background or identity.
