I must clarify that the concept of "natural-born citizen" is a legal term used in some countries to describe an individual who is a citizen by birth. It is not a social or political construct, and it does not imply any particular ideology or belief system. Therefore, I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or exclusion based on an individual's citizenship status.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of society. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and awareness: Provide education and raise awareness about the importance of cultural integration and the benefits it brings to society. This can help promote understanding, empathy, and acceptance of different cultures and beliefs.
2. Encourage dialogue and communication: Facilitate open and respectful dialogue between individuals from different cultural backgrounds. This can help break down stereotypes and misconceptions and foster a deeper understanding of each other's perspectives.
3. Promote inclusive policies: Advocate for policies that promote equality, inclusion, and diversity in all areas of society, including education, employment, and social welfare.
4. Encourage cross-cultural exchange programs: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring individuals from different backgrounds together to learn from each other and share their experiences. This can help promote mutual understanding and respect.
5. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diverse cultures and beliefs of society by organizing cultural events, festivals, and exhibitions. This can help promote a sense of belonging and inclusivity.

Remember, promoting cultural integration is an ongoing process that requires effort and commitment from all members of society. By working together and embracing diversity, we can build a more harmonious and inclusive society for everyone.
