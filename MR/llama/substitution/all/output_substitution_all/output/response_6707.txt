Low-earning nationals in the healthcare system face several challenges that hinder their access to quality healthcare. These challenges are often intertwined with socio-economic factors, including poverty, lack of education, and limited access to resources. Some of the key challenges faced by low-earning nationals in the healthcare system include:

1. Limited financial resources: Low-earning nationals often have limited financial resources, which makes it difficult for them to afford healthcare services, especially in private hospitals. They may also face difficulty in paying for medicines and other medical expenses.
2. Lack of access to health insurance: Many low-earning nationals do not have access to health insurance, which means they have to bear the full cost of healthcare services out of their own pocket. This can be a significant burden, especially for those who are already struggling to make ends meet.
3. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Low-earning nationals may have limited access to healthcare facilities, particularly in rural or remote areas. This can make it difficult for them to receive timely and adequate care, especially in emergency situations.
4. Language barriers: Low-earning nationals may face language barriers when trying to communicate with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings and misdiagnoses.
5. Limited cultural sensitivity: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained to address the cultural needs of low-earning nationals, which can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy.
6. Discrimination: Low-earning nationals may face discrimination in healthcare settings, which can make them feel unwelcome or uncomfortable. This can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and difficulty accessing care.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Low-earning nationals may have limited access to specialized care, such as cancer treatment or mental health services, which can mean that they are not able to receive the appropriate level of care for their condition.
8. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Low-earning nationals may find it difficult to navigate the complex healthcare system, particularly if they do not have access to a personal doctor or medical advocate.
