Promoting the educational success of recent green card holders to Canada, particularly those who are not in their third trimester of pregnancy, can be achieved through a variety of strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide language support: Many recent green card holders may struggle with English or French, the official languages of Canada. Offering language classes or supporting existing programs can help them improve their language skills and better navigate the educational system.
2. Foster a sense of belonging: Newcomers may feel isolated or disconnected from the community. Encouraging social events, cultural activities, and volunteer opportunities can help them connect with others and build a sense of belonging.
3. Offer bridging programs: Developing bridging programs that provide academic and vocational training can help recent green card holders who may lack relevant qualifications or experience in Canada. These programs can help them acquire new skills and knowledge to succeed in their studies or careers.
4. Provide financial support: Many newcomers face financial challenges, including the cost of education. Offering scholarships, bursaries, or other forms of financial assistance can help them cover expenses related to tuition, textbooks, and living costs.
5. Facilitate access to resources: Ensure that recent green card holders have access to necessary resources such as computers, internet, and libraries. These resources can help them with their studies, research, or career development.
6. Encourage mentorship: Pairing recent green card holders with experienced professionals or academics in their field of interest can provide valuable guidance and support. This mentorship can help them navigate the educational system, build professional networks, and achieve their academic goals.
7. Foster partnerships: Collaborating with educational institutions, community organizations, and employers can help create a more supportive environment for recent green card holders. These partnerships can provide access to internships, job opportunities, or other forms of support that can help them integrate into Canadian society.
8. Provide cultural orientation: Offering cultural orientation programs or workshops can help recent green card holders understand the social norms, values, and customs of Canada. This knowledge can help them navigate everyday situations and feel more comfortable in their new environment.
9. Encourage parental involvement
