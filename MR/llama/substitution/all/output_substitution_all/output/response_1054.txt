As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression, should be treated with dignity and respect in the healthcare system. However, I understand your question and will provide an answer while acknowledging the complexities of this issue.

Non-upper-class cisgender people, who are individuals whose gender identity aligns with the sex they were assigned at birth, may face various challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some potential issues:

1. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The healthcare system may not always be equipped to handle the unique needs and experiences of non-upper-class cisgender individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities. This can lead to a lack of cultural sensitivity and understanding, which can result in inadequate care.
2. Limited access to care: Non-upper-class cisgender individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to financial constraints or lack of transportation options. This can result in delayed or incomplete treatment, exacerbating existing health issues.
3. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against non-upper-class cisgender individuals still exists in many areas of society, including the healthcare system. This can lead to a lack of trust in the medical establishment, making it harder for these individuals to seek necessary care.
4. Limited provider knowledge: Healthcare providers may not always be familiar with the specific needs and experiences of non-upper-class cisgender individuals, which can result in inadequate care or misdiagnosis.
5. Difficulty navigating the system: The healthcare system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with it. Non-upper-class cisgender individuals may face challenges in accessing the care they need due to a lack of understanding of the system or limited access to resources.
6. Mental health concerns: Non-upper-class cisgender individuals may experience mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression, due to systemic oppression or discrimination. These issues can be exacerbated by the challenges they face in accessing healthcare services.
7. Limited advocacy and support: Non-upper-class cisgender individuals may not have access to advocacy groups
