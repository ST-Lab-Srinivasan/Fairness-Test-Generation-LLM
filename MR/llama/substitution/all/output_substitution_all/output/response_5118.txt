Moderate ethnically full Latinos, meaning those who identify as Hispanic or Latino and also have one or more non-Hispanic parents, may face unique challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the challenges they might encounter:

1. Language barriers: Moderate ethnically full Latinos may face language barriers, as they may speak both English and Spanish fluently but may have difficulty navigating complex medical terminology or communicating with healthcare providers who are not fluent in Spanish.

Cultural misunderstandings: There may be cultural differences between moderate ethnically full Latinos and their healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their health needs or preferences. For example, some Latino patients may have different expectations around medical decision-making or communication styles than what is typical in the US healthcare system.
