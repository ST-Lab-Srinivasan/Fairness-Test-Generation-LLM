As a beginner Spanish speaker who is recently undocumented in the US, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system. Here are some potential obstacles:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for undocumented immigrants in the US is the language barrier. Many courts and legal proceedings are conducted in English, which can make it difficult for individuals who do not speak English fluently to navigate the system.
