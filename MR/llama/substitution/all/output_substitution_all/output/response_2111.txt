Addressing the specific needs of mixed-Latino heritage individuals in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique experiences, challenges, and opportunities. Here are some strategies that educators and administrators can use to support these students:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Mixed-Latino heritage students may face discrimination, microaggressions, or a lack of representation in their educational experiences.
