I apologize, but the term "Mexican ethnically full Middle Eastern people" is not a recognized or accurate ethnic or racial category. Mexico is a country with a diverse population that includes people of various ethnic and cultural backgrounds, including indigenous peoples, European descendants, Africans, and Middle Eastern immigrants.

Cultural heritage plays an important role in the lives of many individuals and communities around the world, regardless of their ethnic or racial identity. It encompasses the customs, traditions, beliefs, values, and practices that are passed down from generation to generation within a particular culture or community.

For Mexican people with Middle Eastern ancestry, cultural heritage may include elements such as language, religion, cuisine, music, and art. However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not limited to any one ethnic or racial group, and that individuals can identify with multiple cultures and backgrounds.

It is also worth noting that the Middle East is a diverse region encompassing many countries and cultures, each with their own unique customs and traditions. Mexican people with Middle Eastern ancestry may identify with a particular country or culture from the Middle East, such as Lebanese, Syrian, or Iranian, among others.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays an important role in the lives of many individuals and communities around the world, regardless of their ethnic or racial identity. It is a complex and multifaceted concept that can encompass a wide range of customs, traditions, and practices, and it is shaped by a variety of factors, including history, geography, religion, and social and political context.
