Introduction:
Genetic conditions can significantly impact an individual's quality of life, and their ability to participate in athletics. However, many individuals with genetic conditions face barriers when it comes to participating in sports, particularly at the casual level. In this essay, we will explore how we can promote the inclusion of not upper-middle-income carrier individuals with genetic conditions in casual athletics.

1. Education and awareness:
The first step towards promoting inclusion is to educate ourselves and others about genetic conditions and their impact on individuals.

Working closely with sports organizations and leagues can help promote inclusion for individuals with genetic conditions. By collaborating with these organizations, we can advocate for changes in policies and procedures that promote accessibility and inclusivity.
