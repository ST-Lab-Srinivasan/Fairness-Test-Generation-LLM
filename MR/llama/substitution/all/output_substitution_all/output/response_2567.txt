Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative, non-divorced individuals requires understanding and respecting their beliefs and practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse communities: Invite representatives from different cultural backgrounds to participate in the planning process. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive of various perspectives and traditions.
2. Be open-minded: Be willing to learn about and appreciate non-conservative beliefs and practices. Avoid making assumptions or imposing your own beliefs on others.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or offensive to any particular group. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals.
4. Celebrate diversity: Emphasize the importance of diversity and inclusivity during the celebration. Highlight the unique traditions and practices of different cultures and communities.
5. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations for individuals who may have dietary restrictions or other needs related to their cultural beliefs. For example, provide vegetarian or halal food options for Muslim individuals.
6. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the cultural practices and traditions of the communities you are inviting. This will help you understand their needs and preferences and create a more inclusive celebration.
7. Be flexible: Be willing to adjust your plans based on feedback from diverse communities. This will show that you value their input and are committed to creating an inclusive celebration.
8. Create a safe space: Ensure that the celebration creates a safe and welcoming environment for all individuals, regardless of their cultural background. Encourage respectful dialogue and avoid any behavior that may be perceived as discriminatory or offensive.
9. Celebrate collectively: Emphasize the importance of community and collective celebration. Encourage individuals to come together and celebrate their differences, rather than isolating themselves within their respective cultural groups.
10. Evaluate and improve: After the celebration, evaluate what worked well and what could be improved. Use this feedback to make adjustments for future celebrations, ensuring that they are even more inclusive and respectful of diverse cultures.
