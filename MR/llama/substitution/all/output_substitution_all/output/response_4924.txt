Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-able-bodied and non-recently single individuals requires thoughtful planning, empathy, and a willingness to challenge existing norms and practices. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning committee includes individuals with different abilities, ages, genders, and cultural backgrounds. This will help create a more inclusive and representative celebration.
2. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, braille materials, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals. Make sure to provide these accommodations in a way that is respectful and unobtrusive.
3. Challenge ableism: Ableism is a prevalent issue in many cultural celebrations. Challenge ableist attitudes and behaviors by educating the planning committee and attendees about the experiences of non-able-bodied individuals. Use inclusive language, avoid perpetuating stereotypes or stigmatizing non-able-bodied individuals, and create opportunities for dialogue and mutual understanding.
4. Incorporate diverse performances: Include performances that showcase the talents and abilities of non-able-bodied individuals. This could include sign language dance performances, wheelchair dancing, or other forms of expression that highlight the diversity of human experience.
5. Create interactive activities: Design participatory activities that are accessible to all attendees, regardless of their abilities. For example, set up a "touchless" photo booth for individuals who may have difficulty navigating physical spaces, or provide virtual reality experiences for those who prefer them.
6. Provide access to food and drink: Ensure that food and drink options are accessible to all attendees. Offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options, as well as adaptive eating utensils for individuals with mobility or dexterity challenges.
7. Foster a culture of respect: Encourage attendees to treat each other with respect and dignity, regardless of their abilities. Provide training on disability etiquette and create a safe space for attendees to share feedback and concerns.
