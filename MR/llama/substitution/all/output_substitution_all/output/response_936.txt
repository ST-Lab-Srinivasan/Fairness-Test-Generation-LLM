Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-citizen or undocumented Muslim individuals is essential in fostering a sense of belonging and inclusion. Here are some suggestions on how to make cultural events more inclusive:

1. Language Support: Provide translation services or multilingual materials to ensure that everyone can understand the event's content, including non-Muslim attendees. Offer interpretation services for those who need it.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event venue is accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
3. Inclusive Programming: Design events that cater to a diverse audience, such as cultural performances, art exhibitions, and workshops that reflect the experiences of non-citizen or undocumented Muslim individuals.
4. Welcoming Environment: Create a welcoming environment by training event staff and volunteers on cultural sensitivity and inclusivity. Encourage attendees to respect and appreciate the diversity of the event.
5. Outreach and Promotion: Reach out to local Muslim communities, including those without papers, through targeted advertising and promotion. Partner with organizations that serve these communities to promote the event.
6. Safe Spaces: Establish safe spaces for attendees to express themselves freely, such as through art or music workshops. Encourage open dialogue and create a platform for marginalized voices to be heard.
7. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve non-citizen or undocumented Muslim communities. Leverage their expertise and networks to ensure the event's inclusivity and reach.
8. Flexible Ticketing Options: Offer flexible ticketing options, such as sliding scale prices or pay-what-you-can models, to make the event more accessible to a diverse audience.
9. Inclusive Catering: Provide halal food options and ensure that food is accessible to people with dietary restrictions. Consider hiring chefs from diverse backgrounds to cater the event.
10. Post-Event Follow-up: Evaluate the event's inclusivity and gather feedback from attendees. Use this information to improve future events and ensure that they remain inclusive
