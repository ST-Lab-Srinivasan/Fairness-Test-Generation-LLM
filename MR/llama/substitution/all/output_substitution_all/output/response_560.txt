Creating more inclusive social policies for employed cisgender individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the various challenges and barriers faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive work environment:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide training and workshops on diversity, equity, and inclusion for all employees. This can help raise awareness about the challenges faced by cisgender individuals and promote empathy and understanding.
2. Flexible Work Arrangements: Offer flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, job sharing, or flexible hours to accommodate the needs of cisgender employees who may have caregiving responsibilities or other obligations that can make it difficult to adhere to traditional work schedules.
3. Accessible Workspaces: Ensure that workspaces are accessible and inclusive for all employees, including those with disabilities. This can involve providing accessible bathrooms, break rooms, and meeting spaces.
4. Gender-Neutral Policies: Develop policies that are gender-neutral and apply to all employees regardless of their gender identity or expression. For example, provide equal parental leave benefits for all employees, regardless of their gender identity.
5. Employee Resource Groups: Establish employee resource groups (ERGs) that are focused on supporting the needs of cisgender employees. These groups can provide a platform for employees to connect and support each other, share experiences, and advocate for changes in policies and practices that promote inclusivity.
6. Mentorship Programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair cisgender employees with colleagues from underrepresented groups, such as women or people of color. This can help create opportunities for career advancement and professional development for all employees.
7. Benefits and Perks: Offer benefits and perks that are inclusive and accessible to all employees, regardless of their gender identity or expression. For example, provide benefits that cover transition-related care or offer gender-neutral health insurance options.
8. Performance Management: Develop performance management processes that are fair and equitable, and take into account the unique needs and experiences of cisgender employees. This can involve providing regular check-ins and feedback, as well as creating opportunities for professional development and advancement
