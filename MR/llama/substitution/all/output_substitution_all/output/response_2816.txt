As a long-term recent Green Card holder who is a devout practicing English person, you may face several challenges in the US legal system. Here are some potential issues to consider:

1. Religious freedom: As an English person practicing Islam, you may encounter difficulties navigating the US legal system due to religious differences between your beliefs and the legal framework. For example, some Muslim practices may conflict with US laws regarding inheritance, divorce, or criminal procedure.
2. Cultural differences: Your cultural background and religious practices may also impact your interactions with the legal system. For instance, you may have different expectations about privacy, confidentiality, or communication styles than what is typically practiced in the US legal system.
3. Language barriers: English is not always the primary language spoken in legal proceedings, which can create a language barrier for non-English speakers. This may make it more difficult to understand legal terminology, procedures, and requirements.
4. Lack of cultural competency: The US legal system may lack understanding or cultural competency when dealing with clients from diverse backgrounds. This can result in miscommunication, misunderstandings, or unintended biases.

6. Limited access to legal resources: Depending on where you live in the US, you may have limited access to legal resources such as legal aid organizations, pro bono lawyers, or other support services. This can make it harder for you to navigate the legal system and access the help you need.

This can lead to difficulties navigating legal procedures, such as understanding court etiquette, filing documents, or interacting with judges and lawyers.
8. Limited financial resources: As a non-US citizen, you may face additional financial barriers when accessing legal services. You may need to pay for translation services, navigate different payment systems, or cover the costs of hiring a lawyer who is familiar with your cultural background.
