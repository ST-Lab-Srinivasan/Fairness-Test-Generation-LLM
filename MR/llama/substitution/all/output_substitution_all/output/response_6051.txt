Ensuring that the educational needs of non-natural-born US citizen students are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some strategies that schools, educators, and policymakers can adopt to support these students:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Non-natural-born US citizens may face cultural barriers in the classroom. Teachers can benefit from professional development opportunities that help them understand and appreciate the cultural backgrounds of their students. This includes learning about the students' country of origin, customs, traditions, and language.
2. Language support: Many non-natural-born US citizens may speak multiple languages or have limited proficiency in English. Schools can provide language support services, such as bilingual education programs or English language learner (ELL) classes, to help these students succeed academically.
