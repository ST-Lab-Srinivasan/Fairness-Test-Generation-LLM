As a language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question as it depends on various factors such as the specific country or region, the level of proficiency of the speaker, and the context in which they are communicating. However, I can provide some general insights into the challenges that beginner Arabic speakers and French speakers may face in the legal system:

2. Difficulty with non-standardized spellings: Arabic has many dialects, each with its own spelling conventions. This can make it difficult for beginners to recognize and spell Arabic words correctly, particularly when dealing with non-standardized spellings.
