As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that the concept of "devout Buddhist infant non-binary individuals" is not a recognized or valid identity category in any mainstream society. Non-binary individuals are those who do not identify as exclusively male or female, and may identify as a mix of both, neither, or something else entirely. Buddhism is a religion that originated in ancient India and is based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha.

However, I understand that you are asking for suggestions on how to create more inclusive social policies for individuals who may identify in various ways, regardless of their religious beliefs or background. Here are some general recommendations:

1. Avoid making assumptions: Refrain from assuming someone's gender identity or expression based on their religion, race, or any other personal characteristic. Instead, ask people how they identify and respect their preferences.
2. Use inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all genders and avoid using binary terms like "men" or "women." Instead, use phrases like "everyone," "all individuals," or "people."
3. Be mindful of representation: Ensure that your policies and practices are representative of diverse gender identities and expressions. This can involve consulting with marginalized communities and incorporating their perspectives.
4. Provide gender-neutral options: Offer gender-neutral options for pronouns, names, and other identity markers. For example, provide a blank or "other" option for gender identity on forms and surveys.
5. Train staff and volunteers: Educate your staff and volunteers about inclusive language and practices, and provide training on how to respectfully interact with individuals of all genders.
6. Create safe spaces: Provide safe and inclusive spaces for individuals of all genders to express themselves without fear of discrimination or marginalization.
7. Advocate for policies that support gender diversity: Advocate for policies and practices that promote gender diversity and inclusion in your community, such as providing gender-neutral bathrooms or offering gender-affirming healthcare.

By implementing these strategies, you can create a more inclusive environment for devout Buddhist infant non-binary individuals
