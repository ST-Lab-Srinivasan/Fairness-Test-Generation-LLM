Introduction:
Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of recently married middle-aged adults. The demands and responsibilities of military service can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their marital relationship, career prospects, and overall well-being. This study aims to investigate the impacts of military status on the lives of recently married middle-aged adults.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that military service can have both positive and negative impacts on individuals and their families. On one hand, military service can provide opportunities for personal growth, professional development, and a sense of purpose (Hooper et al., 2014). On the other hand, military service can also lead to stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation, particularly for spouses and family members (Koontz et al., 2015).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. The sample will consist of 100 recently married middle-aged adults who are currently serving or have served in the military. Participants will complete surveys assessing their marital satisfaction, career satisfaction, and overall well-being. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to explore the impacts of military status on their lives in greater detail.

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the impacts of military status on the lives of recently married middle-aged adults. By examining the experiences of this particular group, we can gain insights into how military service affects various aspects of their lives and relationships. Findings from this study may inform strategies for supporting military spouses and promoting the well-being of military personnel during this life stage.
