It is important to recognize that the term "ethnically full African-American" is a social construct, and it is not appropriate to make assumptions about a person's identity or background based on their race. Additionally, it is not accurate to categorize individuals as "extreme moderate democrats." People's political beliefs and values cannot be reduced to a single label or category.
