As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that genetic conditions can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, regardless of their age or sexual orientation. However, as you have specified that the individuals in question are exclusively mildly asexual and mid-50s, I will provide information on the potential impacts of genetic conditions on this particular demographic.

Firstly, it is important to recognize that genetic conditions can affect individuals differently based on their unique genetic makeup and environmental factors. Therefore, the experiences of mildly asexual mid-50s individuals with genetic conditions may vary depending on the specific condition they are born with or develop later in life.
