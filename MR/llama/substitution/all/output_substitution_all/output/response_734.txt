1. Listen and validate their feelings: Allow them to express their emotions without judgment, and validate their feelings by acknowledging that their experiences are normal and understandable.
2. Encourage self-care: Suggest activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature.

6. Help them focus on the present: Encourage them to take things one step at a time, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future.
7. Remind them of their strengths: Help them recognize their own resilience and coping abilities, and remind them of times in the past when they have handled difficult situations successfully.
