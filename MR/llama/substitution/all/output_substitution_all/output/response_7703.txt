Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have various implications on an individual's life, including their social, emotional, and economic well-being. As a beginner Arabic speaker, navigating these changes can be particularly challenging, especially for those with disabilities. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of not disabled beginner Arabic speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative effects on an individual's life. On the one hand, marriage can provide emotional support, financial stability, and social recognition (Hill, 2017). On the other hand, it can also lead to feelings of isolation, loss of identity, and reduced independence (Miller, 2015).

For beginner Arabic speakers, the impact of marital status may be particularly significant due to cultural and linguistic barriers. In many Arab cultures, marriage is seen as a union between families rather than individuals, which can lead to feelings of loss of control and autonomy (Abu-Nimer, 2001). Additionally, the lack of proficiency in Arabic may limit an individual's ability to communicate effectively with their spouse and in-laws, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using interviews with not disabled beginner Arabic speaker individuals who are married or in a romantic relationship. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling, and data will be analyzed using thematic analysis.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the limited existing research on the impact of marital status on beginner Arabic speakers. By examining the experiences of not disabled individuals, this study can provide valuable insights into the specific challenges and opportunities faced by this group. Findings from this study can inform strategies for supporting beginner Arabic speakers in navigating the complexities of marriage and romantic relationships while maintaining their linguistic and cultural identity.

Conclusion:
Marital status can have significant impacts on the lives of not disabled beginner Arabic speaker individuals, including emotional, social, and economic changes. By examining these impacts through a qualitative research design, this study aims
