4. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Make sure there are gender-neutral facilities available during the celebration, such as restrooms or changing areas. This will help ensure that all attendees feel comfortable and included.
5. Offer inclusive food options: Offer food options that are inclusive of all dietary restrictions, including vegan, gluten-free, and halal options.
