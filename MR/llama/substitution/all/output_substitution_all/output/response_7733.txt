1. Need-based scholarships: Offer financial aid to individuals who cannot afford the cost of cultural programs, ensuring that socioeconomic status does not act as a barrier to participation.
2. Outreach and partnerships: Develop relationships with local organizations, schools, and community centers that serve lower-middle-income communities. Collaborate on cultural programming and outreach efforts to reach a broader audience.

4. Accessibility features: Ensure that cultural programs are physically and virtually accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations like American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or closed captions for virtual events.
5. Multilingual programming: Offer cultural programs in multiple languages to cater to the diverse linguistic needs of lower-middle-income communities. This can include translated marketing materials, bilingual staff, and interpreters at events.
