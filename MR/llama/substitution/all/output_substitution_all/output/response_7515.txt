Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for leftist partnered individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve marginalized communities in the planning process: Make sure that marginalized communities, such as people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and individuals with disabilities, are involved in the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that their voices and perspectives are heard and represented.
2. Challenge traditional narratives: Challenge the traditional narratives and representations of cultural celebrations by incorporating diverse voices and perspectives. For example, instead of only showcasing the same old traditions and customs, consider including new and innovative elements that reflect the diversity of the community.
3. Foster inclusive spaces: Create inclusive spaces for cultural celebrations by being mindful of accessibility and accommodations for individuals with disabilities. This can include providing sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or Braille materials for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision, or individuals who have other disabilities.
4. Celebrate diverse identities: Celebrate the diverse identities and experiences of leftist partnered individuals by incorporating elements that reflect their cultural backgrounds and experiences. For example, include music, dance, and art from different cultures and communities, or feature speakers who represent a range of voices and perspectives.
5. Address power dynamics: Be mindful of power dynamics within the community and work to address any imbalances. For example, involve marginalized communities in leadership roles and decision-making processes, or provide resources and support for individuals who may have historically been excluded or marginalized.
6. Create intersectional spaces: Create spaces that are inclusive of multiple identities and experiences. This can involve incorporating elements that reflect the intersections of race, gender, sexuality, class, ability, and other forms of identity.
7. Provide access to resources: Provide access to resources and support for individuals who may face barriers to participating in cultural celebrations. This can include financial assistance, childcare support, or accommodations for individuals with disabilities.
8. Foster a sense of belonging: Work to create a sense of belonging within the community by fostering connections and relationships
