Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, and economic stability. This study aims to explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of people in early pregnancy (1st trimester) and those who are not single for a long time.

The sample will consist of 50 immigrant women in early pregnancy (1st trimester) and 50 non-immigrant women who are not single for a long time. Data will be collected through interviews, focus groups, and surveys.
