As a moderate libertarian, you may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in China as a beginner Chinese speaker. Here are some of the common challenges you may encounter:

1. Language Barrier: The primary challenge for any non-native speaker in China is the language barrier. Legal terminology and procedures can be complex, and it may be difficult to understand without a good command of Mandarin. This can make it hard to communicate with legal professionals, read legal documents, or participate in legal proceedings.
2. Cultural Differences: China has a unique legal culture that is different from Western countries. For example, the concept of "guanxi" (relationships) is highly valued in Chinese society, which can influence the way justice is administered. As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may find it challenging to understand these cultural nuances and how they impact the legal system.
3. Limited Legal Resources: While China has a comprehensive legal system, there may be limited resources available for beginners, especially in rural areas. This can make it difficult to access legal aid or advice, which can exacerbate the language barrier challenge.
4. Lack of Trust: As a non-native speaker, you may face challenges building trust with legal professionals and authorities. This can be particularly true if you are unfamiliar with the legal system in China and may not know how to navigate it effectively.
5. Different Expectations: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may have different expectations about how the legal system should work based on your cultural background or prior experiences. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications with legal professionals, which can hinder your ability to access justice.
6. Limited Access to Information: In some areas of China, there may be limited access to legal information and resources, such as law books, legal databases, or online resources. This can make it difficult to research the law or stay informed about changes in the legal system.
7. Difficulty in Finding Legal Representation: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may find it challenging to find a lawyer who speaks your language fluently or has experience working with non-native speakers. This can limit your access to legal representation and advice.
8. Time Constraints: The legal system in China
