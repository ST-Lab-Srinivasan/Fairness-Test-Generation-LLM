Advocating for the rights of long-time active duty military personnel can be a challenging but rewarding endeavor. Here are some examples of successful advocacy efforts in this area:

1. Expansion of Combat Zone Tax Exclusion: In 2009, the Military Coalition, a group of 35 military and veterans organizations, successfully advocated for the expansion of the combat zone tax exclusion to include service members who served in any conflict after September 11, 2001. This change allowed more service members to take advantage of the tax break and receive the benefits they deserve.
2. Increased Funding for Veterans' Mental Health: The National League of POW/MIA Families and other advocacy groups have successfully pushed for increased funding for veterans' mental health services. This includes efforts to improve access to care, increase the number of providers, and provide more resources for suicide prevention.
3. Expansion of GI Bill Benefits: The Military Order of the Purple Heart and other organizations have advocated for the expansion of GI Bill benefits, including increased funding for tuition and housing stipends. These efforts have led to improvements in the quality of education and living conditions for veterans pursuing higher education.
4. Protection of Specialty Licenses: The Armed Services YMCA has advocated for the protection of specialty licenses held by military spouses, allowing them to maintain their careers even when moving to a new duty station. This effort has helped military spouses balance their work and family responsibilities more effectively.
5. Improved Care for Military Children: The Military Child Education Coalition (MCEC) has advocated for improved educational opportunities and support services for military children. These efforts have led to increased funding for military-connected schools, expanded access to tutoring and extracurricular activities, and more resources for military families.
6. Reduction of PCS Costs: The Military Relief Society has advocated for reduced costs associated with military moves, including the elimination of some fees and charges. These efforts have helped military families save money on moving expenses and reduce the financial burden of frequent relocations.
7. Increased Support for Wounded Warriors: The Wounded War
