To ensure that the healthcare needs of upper middle-income native French speakers are met, several strategies can be implemented:

1. Improve access to healthcare services: Upper middle-income countries often have a mix of public and private healthcare providers, but access to quality care can still be a challenge for some populations, particularly in rural or underserved areas. Investing in infrastructure, transportation, and communication networks can help improve access to healthcare services for upper middle-income French speakers.
2.

For example, providers can offer gender-segregated consultation rooms or provide interpreters for patients who do not speak French fluently.

Investing in preventive care, such as early detection and screening programs, can help reduce the risk of these diseases and improve health outcomes for upper middle-income French speakers.

Addressing social determinants of health such as poverty, education, housing, and employment can help improve health outcomes for upper middle-income French speakers.
