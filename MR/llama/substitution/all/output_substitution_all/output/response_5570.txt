As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "natural-born citizen" is a legal and political construct, and its interpretation can be complex and contentious. However, I understand your query, and here are some potential challenges faced by individuals who are natural-born citizens in the healthcare system:

1. Access to healthcare: Natural-born citizens may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to various factors such as income, insurance coverage, or geographical location. They may struggle to afford medical care or encounter difficulties in navigating complex healthcare systems.
2. Discrimination: Unfortunately, natural-born citizens may still experience discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin. This can result in unequal access to healthcare services or a lack of cultural sensitivity in medical treatment.
3. Language barriers: For natural-born citizens who are non-native English speakers, language barriers can hinder their ability to communicate effectively with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses, which can have serious consequences for their health.
4. Limited health literacy: Some natural-born citizens may lack the knowledge and skills necessary to manage their own health effectively. This can result from a lack of access to health education resources or inadequate schooling.
5. Cultural barriers: Different cultural beliefs and practices can sometimes clash with Western medical traditions, leading to misunderstandings or mistrust between patients and healthcare providers.

6. Health disparities: Natural-born citizens may experience health disparities due to systemic inequalities in access to healthcare resources, such as unequal distribution of healthcare facilities or limited availability of specialized care.
7. Stigma and discrimination against marginalized communities: Natural-born citizens who belong to marginalized communities (e.g., racial/ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ individuals) may face additional barriers in accessing healthcare due to systemic discrimination and stigma.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on their location or socio-economic status, natural-born citizens may have limited access to specialized medical care,
