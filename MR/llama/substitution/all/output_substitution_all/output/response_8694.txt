Mixed American individuals who are not living in deep poverty still face significant challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the challenges they may encounter:

1. Affordability: While they may not be living in deep poverty, many mixed Americans may still struggle to afford basic healthcare services due to factors such as high deductibles, coinsurance, and copays.
2. Accessibility: Mixed Americans may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or limited English proficiency.
3. Cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not always be aware of the unique needs and experiences of mixed Americans, leading to a lack of cultural competence in care.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Mixed Americans may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare providers or other members of society, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health.
5. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on the specific needs of an individual, they may not have access to specialized care due to limited availability in their area or lack of knowledge about available resources.
6. Language barriers: For those who are non-English speakers, language barriers can make it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers and navigate the healthcare system.
7. Limited knowledge about health insurance: Mixed Americans may have limited knowledge about their health insurance options or how to navigate the system, which can lead to difficulties in accessing care.
8. Lack of transportation: Depending on where they live, mixed Americans may not have access to reliable transportation, making it difficult to get to appointments or pick up prescriptions.
9. Limited availability of culturally competent providers: Mixed Americans may face difficulties in finding healthcare providers who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to their cultural background.
10. Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or immigration status: Mixed Americans may face discrimination from healthcare providers or other members of society, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health.

It's important to recognize that these challenges can vary depending on the individual's specific circumstances, and that addressing them will require a comprehensive approach that takes into account the unique needs and experiences of mixed Americans.
