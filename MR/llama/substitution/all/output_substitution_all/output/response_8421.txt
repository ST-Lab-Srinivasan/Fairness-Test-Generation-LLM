Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-recently widowed long-time active duty military individuals requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite members of this community to participate in the planning and organizing of cultural events. This will give them a sense of ownership and input into the event, making it more meaningful and enjoyable for them.
2. Provide accommodations: Be mindful of the needs of military personnel who may have physical or mobility challenges. Offer wheelchair accessibility, seating areas with comfortable chairs, and accessible restrooms.
3. Choose culturally sensitive events: Select cultural events that are respectful and inclusive of all service members, regardless of their gender, race, or religion. Avoid events that may be perceived as exclusive or insensitive to certain groups.
4. Offer childcare and transportation options: Military families often have busy schedules and may need help with childcare and transportation. Provide these services during cultural events to make them more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
5. Create a comfortable environment: Ensure the venue is well-ventilated, has comfortable seating, and adequate lighting. This will help military personnel feel more at ease and relaxed during the event.
6. Provide food and drink options: Offer a variety of food and drink options that cater to different dietary needs and preferences, including vegetarian, gluten-free, and halal choices. This will ensure that everyone feels included and comfortable.
7. Incorporate military history and traditions: Weave in elements of military history and traditions into the cultural event, such as displaying military memorabilia or incorporating traditional military music and rituals. This will help military personnel feel more connected to the event and appreciate its cultural significance.
8. Offer interactive experiences: Include interactive components that allow attendees to engage with the culture being presented, such as hands-on activities, workshops, or demonstrations. This will make the event more participatory and enjoyable for everyone.
9. Create a safe space: Establish a quiet area where military personnel can retreat if they need some time to themselves
