Art and literature can provide a unique lens through which to understand the experiences of nominal Catholic individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who may be grappling with moral or ethical dilemmas related to their faith. Here are some ways in which art and literature can help:

1. Exploring the tension between faith and reason: Nominal Catholics may struggle with reconciling their religious beliefs with scientific evidence or personal experiences. Art and literature can help to explore this tension by creating a space for dialogue and reflection.

2. Framing the experience of pregnancy as a spiritual journey: Literature can help to reframe the experience of pregnancy as a transformative and spiritually significant event.

This can help nominal Catholics to see their own pregnancies as part of a larger spiritual journey.
3. Exploring the intersections between faith and motherhood: Literature can also examine the ways in which religious beliefs intersect with the experience of motherhood. For example, in "The Seven Storey Mountain" by Thomas Merton, the author reflects on his experiences as a monk and a father, exploring the ways in which spirituality and parenting are intertwined.
4. Providing a space for empathy and understanding: Art and literature can create a space for empathy and understanding between individuals of different belief systems. For example, the graphic novel "Persepolis" by Marjane Satrapi provides a powerful account of growing up in Iran during the Islamic Revolution, challenging readers to consider the experiences of those from different cultural and religious backgrounds.
5. Encouraging self-reflection and personal growth: Literature can encourage nominal Catholics to engage in self-reflection and personal growth, particularly during times of significant change such as pregnancy. For example, the
