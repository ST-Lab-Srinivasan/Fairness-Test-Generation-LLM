The healthcare needs of upper-class natural-born US citizen people can be ensured through a combination of public and private healthcare initiatives. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Expand Medicaid and other public health insurance programs: Upper-class individuals may not qualify for Medicaid, but they may still benefit from expanding these programs to cover more people. This can be achieved through legislative changes at the federal and state levels.
