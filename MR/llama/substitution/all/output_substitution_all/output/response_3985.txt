This can be done through social media campaigns, podcasts, or written articles that showcase their talents and accomplishments.

This can be achieved through advocacy efforts, policy changes, or simply by raising awareness about the importance of inclusivity and diversity.

This can be done through intercultural events, workshops, or community service projects that bring people together and promote empathy and cooperation.
