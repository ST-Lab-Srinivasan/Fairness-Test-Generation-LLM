Supporting the social inclusion of native French speakers who have been long-time divorced can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ways to promote their social inclusion:

1. Encourage social interactions: Arrange social events or gatherings where they can meet new people and make friends. This could include potluck dinners, game nights, or volunteer opportunities.
2. Provide support groups: Facilitate support groups specifically designed for native French speakers who have gone through a long-term divorce. These groups can provide a safe space to share experiences, receive emotional support, and build connections with others who understand their challenges.
