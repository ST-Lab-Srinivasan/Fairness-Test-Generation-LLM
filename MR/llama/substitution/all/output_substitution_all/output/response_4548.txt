The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of native French speakers who are not liberal. In authoritarian or repressive regimes, the military is often used to enforce the government's power and suppress dissent. This can lead to a range of negative consequences for non-liberal individuals, including:

1. Restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly: Non-liberal individuals may face restrictions on their ability to express their opinions or participate in peaceful protests, as the military is used to quell dissent and maintain order.
2. Repression of minority groups: In some cases, the military may be used to target minority groups, such as religious or ethnic minorities, and suppress their rights and freedoms.
3. Limited access to education and employment: Non-liberal individuals may face limitations on their access to education and employment opportunities, as the military is often prioritized over civilian sectors of the economy.
4. Lack of political representation: Non-liberal individuals may have limited representation in government or political institutions, as the military is often seen as the most powerful and influential institution in society.
5. Dependence on the military for economic survival: In some cases, non-liberal individuals may be dependent on the military for their economic survival, particularly if they work in industries related to military production or defense.
6. Limited access to social services: Non-liberal individuals may have limited access to social services such as healthcare and education, as the military is often prioritized over civilian needs.
7. Increased risk of human rights abuses: Non-liberal individuals may be at increased risk of human rights abuses, particularly if they are members of minority groups or political dissidents.
8. Limited ability to participate in civic society: Non-liberal individuals may have limited ability to participate in civil society organizations or engage in community activities, as the military is often seen as the most important and influential institution in society.
