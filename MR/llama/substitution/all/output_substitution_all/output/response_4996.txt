Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to diverse patient populations, including those with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Autistic individuals often face unique challenges in accessing and receiving appropriate healthcare due to various barriers, such as communication difficulties, sensory sensitivities, and social anxiety.
