Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make public spaces more welcoming and accessible for this group:

1. Provide Multilingual Signage: Use bilingual or multilingual signage in both simplified and traditional Chinese characters, as well as the local language, to ensure that all visitors can understand the information being conveyed. This can include signs at public transportation stations, parks, and other public spaces.
2. Offer Language Support: Provide language support services such as interpretation, translation, and language classes for non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers. This can help them navigate public spaces more easily and participate in community activities.
3. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for public space staff and volunteers to help them understand the needs and preferences of non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers. This can include training on how to communicate effectively with individuals who may not speak the dominant language or culture.
4. Accessibility Features: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to all, including those with disabilities. Provide features such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms to make public spaces more inclusive.
5. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to reach out to non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers and involve them in the design and development of public spaces. This can help ensure that these spaces are responsive to their needs and preferences.
6. Inclusive Design: Design public spaces that are inclusive and accessible to all, regardless of language proficiency or cultural background. This can include using universal design principles, such as providing multiple ways to access information and navigate the space.
7. Technology Integration: Utilize technology, such as mobile apps and virtual reality, to provide interactive and immersive experiences for non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers. This can help them feel more comfortable and engaged in public spaces.
8. Volunteer Programs: Establish volunteer programs that recruit and train individuals from diverse backgrounds to serve as ambassadors or mentors for non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers. This can provide additional support and guidance for these individuals in navigating public spaces.
