It is important to recognize that the healthcare system in the United States has historically been shaped by systemic inequalities and biases, particularly against marginalized communities. These inequalities can result in disparities in health outcomes and access to care. Therefore, it is crucial to address these issues through policies and practices that promote equity and inclusivity in the healthcare system.

Instead of making generalizations about non-libertarian ethnically full American people, it is important to focus on creating a more inclusive and equitable healthcare system for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. This can involve addressing structural barriers and biases, increasing access to care, and promoting policies that promote social justice and equity in the healthcare system.
