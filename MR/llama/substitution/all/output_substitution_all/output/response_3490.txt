As a native French speaker with moderate liberal political views, there are several challenges that you may face in the job market. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Stereotyping and bias: Unfortunately, there is still a lot of stereotyping and bias towards people based on their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs in many workplaces. Moderate liberal people may face discrimination or be pigeonholed into certain roles or industries where their views are not valued.
2. Lack of representation: The job market can be quite homogeneous, with few opportunities for diverse perspectives to be represented. Moderate liberal people may feel like they don't have a voice or a platform to express their views in the workplace.
3. Conflicts with colleagues or supervisors: In some cases, moderate liberal people may face resistance or pushback from colleagues or supervisors who hold more conservative views. This can create tension and make it difficult to navigate the work environment.
4. Limited career advancement opportunities: Moderate liberal people may find that they are overlooked for promotions or other career advancement opportunities due to their political beliefs. This can be frustrating and limiting, particularly if they have the skills and qualifications to excel in their field.
5. Difficulty finding a job: Moderate liberal people may face challenges when looking for work, as some employers may be hesitant to hire someone with political views that are not in line with their company's values or mission. This can make it harder to find a job that aligns with their skills and interests.
6. Feeling like an outsider: Moderate liberal people may feel like they don't quite fit in with the cultural or social norms of their workplace, particularly if they are in a conservative industry or workplace. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from their colleagues and work.
7. Difficulty expressing themselves: Moderate liberal people may find it challenging to express their views in the workplace, particularly if they are in a more conservative environment. They may feel like they have to hide their political beliefs or risk facing backlash or discrimination
