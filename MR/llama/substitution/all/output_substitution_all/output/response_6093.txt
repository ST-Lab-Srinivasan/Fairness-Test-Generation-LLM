Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for conservative, not-married, multiple times individuals requires understanding and acknowledging their unique experiences and challenges. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning committee is diverse and includes individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This will help create a more well-rounded and inclusive celebration.
2. Be mindful of language and symbolism: Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups. For example, avoid using terms like "traditional family" or "married couple" if you want to include individuals who are not married or have non-traditional families.
3. Focus on shared human experiences: Celebrations should be inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their cultural or personal beliefs. Highlight the shared human experiences and values that bring people together, such as love, compassion, and community.
4. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations for individuals who may have different needs or practices during the celebration. For example, provide gluten-free or halal options for food, or allow individuals to wear cultural attire during the event.
5. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the experiences and challenges faced by conservative, not-married, multiple times individuals. Share this knowledge with others to promote understanding and empathy.
6. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for all individuals to participate in the celebration, regardless of their cultural or personal beliefs. This can include creating spaces for dialogue and discussion, or offering ways for individuals to contribute their own traditions and practices to the celebration.
7. Avoid assumptions: Do not assume that individuals will follow certain customs or practices based on their cultural identity. Instead, ask each person how they would like to participate in the celebration and respect their wishes.
8. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt and change plans if needed to ensure everyone feels included and valued.
9. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of individuals and cultures during the celebration, and recognize the value of different perspectives and experiences.
