Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American natural-born US citizens, particularly those who identify as Indigenous or Native American. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Connection to ancestral lands and communities: Many Native Americans have a deep connection to their ancestral lands and communities, which are often tied to their cultural heritage. This connection can shape their sense of identity and belonging, as well as their relationship with the natural world.
2. Traditional practices and beliefs: Native American cultural heritage includes a rich tapestry of traditional practices and beliefs, such as ceremonies, storytelling, and art. These practices and beliefs are passed down through generations, shaping the identities of individuals who grow up within these communities.
3. Resistance and resilience: Native American cultural heritage has been shaped by a history of colonization, forced assimilation, and marginalization. This history has led to a deep sense of resilience and resistance among many Native Americans, which is an important part of their identity.
4. Community and kinship: For many Native Americans, cultural heritage is tied to their community and kinship ties. They may identify with specific tribes or nations, and feel a strong sense of belonging to these communities.
5. Intersectionality: Many Native Americans identify as both Indigenous and another race or ethnicity (e.g., African American, Latinx). This intersectional identity can shape their experiences and perspectives, and may influence how they express their cultural heritage.
6. Cultural revitalization: Some Native Americans are actively working to revitalize their cultural heritage through language revitalization, cultural preservation, and community-based projects. This work can help shape their identities as well as the identities of future generations.
7. Politics and activism: Many Native Americans are involved in political and social activism, advocating for Indigenous rights and sovereignty. This may influence how they express their cultural heritage and identity.
8. Mixed ancestry: For some Native Americans, their cultural heritage may be complex and mixed, reflecting the historical reality of colonization and intermarriage between Indigenous peoples and other racial or ethnic groups.
