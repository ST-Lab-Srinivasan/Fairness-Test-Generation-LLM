Title: Examining the Impact of Military Status on Beginner Chinese Speaker Extreme Ultra-Libertarians

Introduction:
This research paper aims to investigate the effects of military status on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers who identify as extreme ultra-libertarians. As a growing number of individuals embrace libertarian ideologies, it is essential to understand how their beliefs intersect with their daily lives, particularly in relation to their language learning journey. By analyzing the experiences of beginner Chinese speakers who subscribe to this political philosophy, we can gain valuable insights into the impact of military status on these individuals and their language acquisition processes.

Theoretical Framework:
This study is grounded in the social constructivist theory, which posits that language learning is an active process that involves the construction of meaning through social interactions and experiences (Lewis, 2013). The military status of these individuals will be examined through the lens of power dynamics and how it shapes their language acquisition processes. Specifically, we will investigate how the perceived authority and control exerted by military institutions influence the learners' motivation, engagement, and performance in Chinese language classes.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, incorporating semi-structured interviews and observations of beginner Chinese speakers who identify as extreme ultra-libertarians. Participants will be recruited through online communities and social networks dedicated to libertarian ideologies. To ensure diversity in the sample, we will purposely seek out individuals with varying levels of military experience and exposure.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from interviews and observations will be analyzed thematically, focusing on the impact of military status on language learning experiences. We will identify patterns and trends in how participants perceive and navigate their language acquisition journey, including factors such as motivation, self-efficacy, and performance.

Expected Findings:
Based on social constructivist theory and previous research on language learning and political ideologies (Kiraly & Flege, 2014; McDonough & Meara, 2015), we predict that the military status of beginner Chinese speakers will have a significant impact on their language acquisition processes. Specifically, we expect to find
