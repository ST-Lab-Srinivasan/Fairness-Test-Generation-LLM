Ensuring the healthcare needs of active-duty individuals aged over 90 years old (or over 85 years old) can be challenging, as their healthcare requirements may differ significantly from those of younger populations. Here are some strategies that can help ensure their healthcare needs are met:

1. Early Intervention and Prevention: Encourage early detection and prevention of age-related diseases through regular check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations. This can help identify potential health issues before they become severe, ensuring timely interventions and reducing the risk of complications.
2. Personalized Care Plans: Develop personalized care plans tailored to each individual's unique needs, taking into account their medical history, lifestyle, and goals. This can help ensure that their healthcare needs are met holistically, addressing physical, mental, and social factors that affect their well-being.
3. Multidisciplinary Teams: Assemble multidisciplinary teams consisting of healthcare professionals from various fields, such as gerontology, primary care, specialty care, rehabilitation, and palliative care. These teams can provide comprehensive and coordinated care, ensuring that the individual's healthcare needs are addressed effectively.
4. Telehealth Services: Leverage telehealth services to remotely deliver healthcare services, particularly for individuals living in remote or isolated areas. This can help improve access to care, reduce hospitalizations, and enhance patient satisfaction.
5. Community-Based Care: Encourage community-based care by providing resources and support to family members, caregivers, and local service providers. This can help alleviate the burden on healthcare systems and ensure that individuals receive timely and appropriate care in their homes or communities.
6. Palliative Care: Offer palliative care services to provide relief from pain, suffering, and other symptoms associated with serious illnesses. This can help improve quality of life for individuals nearing the end of life, ensuring that they receive compassionate and dignified care.
7. Long-Term Care Insurance: Encourage the use of long-term care insurance to cover the costs of extended care in nursing homes or assisted living facilities.
