Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of mixed Australian heritage non-conservative people by providing guidance, support, and validation. Here are some ways mentorship can impact the development of this group:

1. Identity formation: Mentorship can help individuals navigate their dual identities and find a sense of belonging within both their Indigenous and non-Indigenous cultures. A mentor can offer insights into the cultural practices, traditions, and values of both groups, helping the mentee understand their place within each culture.
