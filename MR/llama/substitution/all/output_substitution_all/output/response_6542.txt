There are several ways to ensure that the healthcare needs of financially disadvantaged Mexican people are met:

1. Expand access to health insurance: One of the main barriers to accessing healthcare in Mexico is the lack of health insurance. Governments and organizations can work to provide affordable health insurance options to low-income individuals and families, ensuring that they can access necessary medical care.
2. Improve public health infrastructure: Many rural and marginalized communities in Mexico lack access to basic healthcare services due to a lack of infrastructure. Governments can work to improve the quality and availability of public health facilities, including hospitals, clinics, and health centers.
3. Increase funding for community health programs: Community-based health programs, such as mobile health clinics and outreach initiatives, can help reach marginalized populations that may not have access to traditional healthcare services. These programs can provide basic medical care, health education, and disease prevention services.
4. Address social determinants of health: Many health disparities in Mexico are linked to social determinants such as poverty, lack of education, and limited access to clean water and sanitation. Addressing these underlying factors through policies and programs can help improve overall health outcomes.
5. Foster cross-sector partnerships: Collaboration between governments, NGOs, private sector companies, and local communities is crucial for addressing the complex challenges facing Mexico's healthcare system. Partnerships can help leverage resources, expertise, and reach to improve access to healthcare services for marginalized populations.
6. Invest in telemedicine and digital health: Telemedicine and digital health technologies can help bridge the gap between urban and rural areas, as well as provide accessible healthcare services to those living in poverty. These technologies can enable remote consultations, monitoring, and treatment, improving access to care for marginalized populations.
7. Promote prevention and primary care: Investing in primary care and preventive health services can help address the root causes of illnesses and diseases, particularly among marginalized communities. This can involve providing education on healthy behaviors, nutrition, and disease prevention, as well as offering screening programs for early detection
