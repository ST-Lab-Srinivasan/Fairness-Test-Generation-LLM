Introduction:
Marriage and family dynamics can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, including those with permanent residency in countries without known genetic conditions. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of permanent resident no known genetic conditions individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage and family dynamics can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their social relationships, mental health, and economic stability (1-3). For example, married individuals tend to have more social support and better mental health outcomes compared to unmarried individuals (4). However, the impact of marital status on permanent residents with no known genetic conditions has not been well-studied.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of 100 permanent residents in the United States with no known genetic conditions. The survey will collect demographic information, as well as data on participants' marital status, social relationships, mental health, and economic stability. In addition, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gather more detailed qualitative data on their experiences.

Expected Results:
Based on previous research, we expect that married individuals will have better social relationships, mental health outcomes, and economic stability compared to unmarried individuals. However, we also anticipate that the impact of marital status on permanent residents with no known genetic conditions may be less pronounced than in the general population due to the absence of genetic conditions.

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the impacts of marital status on the lives of individuals with permanent residency in countries without known genetic conditions. The findings can inform policies and interventions aimed at improving the well-being of this population.

Conclusion:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of permanent residents with no known genetic conditions. While the expected results suggest that married individuals will have better outcomes in various domains, it is important to recognize that the absence of genetic conditions may mitigate some of these effects. This study will provide valuable insights into the experiences and challenges faced by this population and inform strategies for improving their well
