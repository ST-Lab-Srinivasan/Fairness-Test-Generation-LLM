	* Consider providing private changing areas for students who may feel uncomfortable using shared spaces.
3. Respect students' preferred names and pronouns:
	* Ask students (and their families) about their preferred names and pronouns at the beginning of each school year.
	* Incorporate this information into classroom materials, emails, and other communications to show respect and support.
4. Offer gender-neutral uniform options:
	* Allow students to choose clothing that aligns with their gender identity, without being forced to conform to traditional gender norms.
5. Incorporate LGBTQ+ topics into curricula:
	* Provide age-appropriate education on LGBTQ+ issues and experiences, such as the history of the LGBTQ+ rights movement or the impact of discrimination on transgender individuals.
6. Support students' mental health and well-being:
	* Ensure that counseling services are available for all students, including those who may be experiencing stress or anxiety related to their gender identity.
7. Engage with parents and families:
	* Encourage open communication with parents and families about their child's gender identity and the support they need.
	* Offer training and resources to help families understand and support their transgender children.
8. Advocate for inclusive policies at school and district levels:
	* Work with administrators, teachers
