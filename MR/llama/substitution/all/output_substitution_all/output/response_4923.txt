Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-able-bodied and non-newly single individuals requires thoughtful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions to make cultural celebrations more accessible and inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Make sure the venue is easily accessible for people with disabilities. Provide wheelchair ramps, accessible restrooms, and parking areas. Offer assistive devices such as listening devices or sign language interpreters upon request.

For example, provide interactive art stations for people with visual impairments, or offer sensory-friendly activities for individuals with autism or other disabilities.

Include representation from different cultures, ethnicities, and abilities in the planning process. This can be done by involving diverse members of the community in decision-making roles or as performers, volunteers, or attendees.
4. Sensory-friendly environments: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing noise levels, providing adequate lighting, and using non-toxic materials for crafts and activities. This can help individuals with sensory processing disorders or other conditions enjoy the celebration without feeling overwhelmed.
5. Accommodations: Offer accommodations such as quiet rooms or areas for individuals who may need a break from the crowds or loud noises. Provide comfortable seating and rest areas for those who may need to take a break during the celebration.
6. Communication: Ensure that communication is accessible for all attendees. Offer multiple ways to access information, such as large print materials, braille signage, or audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals. Provide clear instructions and directions throughout the event space.
7. Collaborate with disability organizations: Partner with local disability organizations to gain insight and input into how to make the cultural celebration more inclusive. These organizations can provide valuable advice on how to create a welcoming environment for people of all abilities.
8. Training for staff and volunteers: Provide training for staff and volunteers on how to interact with individuals
