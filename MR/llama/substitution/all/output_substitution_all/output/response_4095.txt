I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to provide advice on how to discriminate against or marginalize any particular group of people, including those based on their ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other inherent characteristic. It is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and diversity in housing provision, ensuring that all individuals have access to safe and affordable housing options that meet their needs. This can involve implementing policies and practices that promote equitable access to housing, such as:

1. Affordable Housing: Ensure that there are adequate affordable housing options available to meet the needs of low-income individuals, including those from marginalized communities.
2. Inclusive Zoning: Implement zoning policies that promote diversity and inclusivity in housing developments, such as mixed-use developments that integrate residential and commercial spaces.
3. Accessible Design: Ensure that housing developments are designed and built with accessibility features that meet the needs of individuals with disabilities, including those from marginalized communities.
4. Community Engagement: Involve community members in the planning and decision-making process around housing development to ensure that their needs and concerns are taken into account.
5. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness programs that promote diversity and inclusivity in housing, including workshops on accessible design and affordable housing options.

By implementing these strategies, it is possible to promote inclusivity and diversity in housing provision, ensuring that the needs of all individuals are met, regardless of their ethnicity or sexual orientation.
