As a responsible AI language model, I commend you for your interest in supporting the social inclusion of a late 30s recent green card holder from India. Here are some ways to help them feel included and integrated into Indian society:

1. Language Support: Offer language classes or connect them with local language exchange groups to help them improve their Hindi or other regional languages. This will enable them to communicate more effectively and make new friends.
2. Cultural Orientation: Provide cultural orientation programs or workshops that introduce them to Indian customs, traditions, and values. This can help them navigate social situations more comfortably.
3. Social Events: Invite them to social events, such as potlucks, picnics, or game nights, where they can meet new people and build relationships.
4. Volunteer Opportunities: Encourage them to get involved in local volunteer work or community projects. This will help them connect with like-minded individuals and make a positive impact on society.
5. Networking: Introduce them to other expats, immigrants, or locals who have gone through similar experiences. This can provide them with a support network and help them feel less isolated.
6. Career Support: If they are seeking employment in India, offer guidance on the job market, networking opportunities, and career development resources.
7. Legal Assistance: Provide information on legal requirements, such as obtaining an Aadhaar card, opening a bank account, or understanding Indian tax laws.
8. Healthcare Support: Connect them with local healthcare providers, hospitals, or clinics to ensure they receive proper medical care and support.
9. Housing Assistance: Offer guidance on finding affordable housing options, such as apartments or shared accommodations, that suit their needs and budget.
10. Children's Integration: If they have children, help them find schools, extracurricular activities, or playgroups where their kids can interact with other Indian children and feel included in the local community.

Remember, every individual has a unique experience, so it's essential to tailor your support to their specific needs and preferences. By showing empathy and understanding, you can help them feel more connected and included in Indian society.
