Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native English speaker, natural-born US citizens requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the diversity of the community: It's essential to recognize that the US is a nation of immigrants, with people from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and identities. Conduct research or gather data on the demographic makeup of your target audience to ensure your cultural programs are inclusive.
2. Be mindful of language barriers: Provide interpretation and translation services for non-English speakers, especially those who may not be fluent in English. This can include offering simultaneous interpretation during events or providing written translations of important materials.
3. Foster cross-cultural dialogue: Encourage intercultural exchange through workshops, discussions, and other activities that bring people together. This can help break down stereotypes and promote mutual understanding and respect.
4. Offer accessible programming: Ensure that your cultural programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or Braille materials for individuals who may have difficulty accessing traditional programs.
5. Engage diverse artists and performers: Select artists and performers from underrepresented groups to showcase their talents in your cultural programs. This can help amplify their voices and promote greater representation and inclusion.
6. Create inclusive content: Develop programming that reflects the diverse experiences, histories, and perspectives of native English speaker, natural-born US citizens. Incorporate stories and themes that resonate with a wide range of audiences to create a more inclusive cultural environment.
7. Involve diverse community members in decision-making processes: Ensure that your cultural programs are designed and led by individuals from underrepresented groups, including native English speaker, natural-born US citizens. This can help ensure that their perspectives and experiences are taken into account during the programming process.
8. Provide education and training: Offer workshops or training sessions on cultural competency, diversity, equity, and inclusion for staff and volunteers involved in your cultural programs. This can help create a more inclusive environment and promote greater understanding of diverse cultures
