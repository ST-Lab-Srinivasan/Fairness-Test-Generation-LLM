Ethnic and racial minorities in the United States face a number of challenges in the healthcare system, even after reaching the poverty line. These challenges can include:

1. Limited access to care: Despite gaining economic stability, ethnic and racial minorities may still face barriers to accessing quality healthcare. This can be due to factors such as lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or cultural and language barriers.

3. Health disparities: Ethnic and racial minorities may experience a higher burden of disease and poorer health outcomes compared to the general population.
