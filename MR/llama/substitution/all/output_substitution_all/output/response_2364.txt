Supporting the economic empowerment of low-income refugees and undocumented immigrants in the United States is crucial for their well-being and integration into society. Here are some ways to support their economic empowerment:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many refugees and undocumented immigrants lack access to traditional banking services, making it difficult for them to save money, send remittances to their families back home, or start a business. Organizations such as the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) are working to address this issue by providing financial inclusion programs that include access to mobile banking and digital payment systems.
