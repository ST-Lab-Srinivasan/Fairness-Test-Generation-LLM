Supporting lower middle-income not disabled communities can be a challenging task, but there are several effective strategies that can help. Here are some of them:

1. Community Mapping: Create a map of the community highlighting the resources available to the lower middle-income not disabled population. This will help identify gaps in services and areas where interventions are needed.
2. Needs Assessment: Conduct a thorough needs assessment to identify the specific needs of the community. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, or other forms of consultation.
3. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities for individuals and organizations within the community. This can help build their skills and knowledge in areas such as leadership, governance, and project management.
4. Economic Empowerment: Support economic empowerment initiatives that promote entrepreneurship, job creation, and financial inclusion. This can be done through microfinance programs, vocational training, and business incubators.
5. Health and Wellness: Improve access to health and wellness services by establishing clinics, hospitals, or community health centers. Provide education on healthy lifestyles, nutrition, and disease prevention.
6. Education and Literacy: Invest in educational programs that provide literacy training, vocational skills, and access to formal education. This can help individuals acquire the skills they need to compete in the job market.
7. Social Cohesion: Foster social cohesion by promoting inter-community dialogue, conflict resolution, and cultural exchange programs. This can help build trust and cooperation among community members.
8. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes that benefit lower middle-income not disabled communities. This can include advocating for affordable housing, fair labor practices, and access to social services.
9. Collaboration with Local Government: Work closely with local government agencies to ensure that policies and programs are inclusive and beneficial to lower middle-income not disabled communities.
10. Community-Led Initiatives: Support community-led initiatives that address the specific needs of the community. This can include initiatives focused on health, education, economic empowerment, and social cohesion.
