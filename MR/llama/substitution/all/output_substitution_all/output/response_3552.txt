As a beginner-level Japanese speaker, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in Japan. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: The legal system in Japan can be complex and difficult to understand for non-native speakers, especially if you don't have a high level of proficiency in Japanese. Many legal documents, such as contracts and court orders, are written in Japanese, making it challenging for beginner-level speakers to comprehend them.
2. Cultural Barrier: The cultural context of the legal system in Japan can also present challenges for foreigners who are not familiar with the customs and traditions of the country. For example, the concept of " face" (or "migi") is an important aspect of Japanese culture, and it can impact how legal proceedings unfold.

This can make it more difficult to navigate the legal system and represent yourself in court.

You may also find it difficult to follow complex legal terminology or technical concepts that are discussed in court.
