Ensuring the healthcare needs of Mexican non-low-income people can be a complex challenge, as it involves addressing systemic barriers and inequalities in the healthcare system. Here are some strategies that could help meet their healthcare needs:

1. Increase access to quality healthcare services: Non-low-income Mexicans may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to lack of infrastructure, resources, or cultural and language barriers. Governments, NGOs, and private organizations can work together to build more healthcare facilities, train medical professionals, and provide equipment and supplies to improve the quality of care.
2. Implement innovative financing mechanisms: Many non-low-income Mexicans lack access to health insurance or have limited financial resources to cover healthcare costs. Governments and private organizations can work together to develop creative financing models, such as community-based funding or social impact bonds, to help pool resources and cover costs.
3. Promote preventive care: Many non-low-income Mexicans may delay seeking medical care until their conditions are more severe, which can lead to higher treatment costs and poorer health outcomes. Governments and NGOs can promote preventive care through public education campaigns, community outreach programs, and targeted interventions to address specific health issues.
4. Address social determinants of health: Non-low-income Mexicans may face structural barriers to healthcare access, such as lack of transportation, affordable housing, or access to nutritious food. Governments and NGOs can work together to address these social determinants of health by investing in infrastructure, community development programs, and social support services.
5. Support indigenous and rural communities: Many non-low-income Mexicans live in remote, hard-to-reach areas where access to healthcare is limited. Governments and NGOs can work together to develop culturally appropriate healthcare services that cater to the unique needs of indigenous and rural communities.
6. Foster community engagement: Non-low-income Mexicans may face cultural or language barriers that prevent them from accessing healthcare services. Governments and NGOs can foster community engagement by promoting cross-cultural understanding
