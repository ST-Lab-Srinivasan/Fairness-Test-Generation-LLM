The legal system can be complex and challenging for any individual, but especially so for mixed-heritage individuals who may face unique obstacles based on their identity. Here are some of the challenges that native French speakers with American heritage may encounter in the legal system:

1. Cultural barriers: As a mixed-heritage individual, you may face cultural barriers within the legal system. For example, legal terminology and procedures may be unfamiliar to you, and you may struggle to navigate a system that is rooted in one culture rather than two.
