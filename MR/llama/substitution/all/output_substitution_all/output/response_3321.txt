The legal system can pose challenges for both native Japanese speakers and native Arabic speakers, as it is often dominated by Western legal traditions and languages. Here are some of the specific challenges that these individuals may face:

1. Language barriers: For native Arabic speakers who are not fluent in Japanese, navigating the legal system can be difficult. Similarly, for native Japanese speakers who are not fluent in Arabic, they may struggle to understand the nuances of Islamic law and its application in the legal system.
2. Cultural differences: The legal systems of Japan and Arab countries have different cultural backgrounds and values, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications. For example, the concept of "face" is important in Japanese culture, but it may not be well understood in other cultures.
3. Lack of representation: Native Japanese speakers and native Arabic speakers may face barriers in accessing legal services due to language barriers or cultural differences. This can result in a lack of representation for these individuals in the legal system.
4. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, there have been instances of bias and discrimination against native Japanese speakers and native Arabic speakers in the legal system. This can result in unfair treatment and outcomes for these individuals.
5. Difficulty navigating procedural laws: The legal systems of Japan and Arab countries have different procedures and requirements, which can be difficult for non-native speakers to navigate. For example, the process of filing a lawsuit or appealing a decision may be unfamiliar to native Japanese speakers who are not familiar with the legal system in Japan.
6. Limited availability of legal resources: Native Japanese speakers and native Arabic speakers may have limited access to legal resources such as translated texts, legal aid organizations, and interpreters. This can make it difficult for them to access the legal assistance they need.
7. Difficulty understanding complex legal concepts: The legal system can be complex and abstract, and it may be challenging for native Japanese speakers and native Arabic speakers to understand complex legal concepts such as contract law or intellectual property rights.
8. Limited cultural competency training for legal professionals: Legal professionals may not receive adequate cultural competency training to work with clients from diverse cultural backgrounds
