The impact of immigration status on the lives of permanent resident individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal rights and protections: Permanent residents have a certain set of legal rights and protections, but they may not have the same level of access to these rights as citizens. For example, permanent residents may face restrictions on their ability to vote, run for public office, or own property.
2. Employment and economic opportunities: Immigration status can impact an individual's ability to find employment, start a business, or access financial services. Permanent residents may face barriers to advancing in their careers or achieving financial stability due to their immigration status.
3. Access to social services: Permanent residents may have limited access to certain social services, such as healthcare, education, and housing. They may also face discrimination when accessing these services based on their immigration status.
4. Social integration: Immigration status can impact an individual's ability to integrate into their community and feel a sense of belonging. Permanent residents may face discrimination or prejudice due to their immigration status, which can make it difficult for them to form social connections and build relationships with their neighbors.
5. Family reunification: Permanent residents may face challenges when trying to reunite with their family members who are not permanent residents or citizens. The immigration process can be complex and time-consuming, and there may be restrictions on the ability of permanent residents to sponsor family members for immigration.
6. Access to benefits: Permanent residents may have limited access to certain benefits, such as welfare or disability support, due to their immigration status. They may also face barriers when accessing other forms of government assistance.
7. Political representation: Permanent residents may have limited political representation and voice in the political process due to their immigration status. They may feel disconnected from the political system and have limited ability to advocate for their rights and interests.
8. Stigma and discrimination: Immigration status can lead to stigma and discrimination against permanent residents, which can impact their mental health and well-being. They may face social exclusion, bullying, or harassment due to their immigration status.
