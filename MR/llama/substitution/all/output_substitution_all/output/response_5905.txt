2. Lack of accommodations: Healthcare providers may not have the necessary accommodations to provide care to people with disabilities, such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
3. Inadequate training: Healthcare providers may not receive adequate training on how to care for patients with disabilities, leading to a lack of understanding and empathy.
4. Stereotyping and stigma: People with disabilities may face stereotypes and stigma from healthcare providers, which can lead to inadequate care and poor communication.

6. Financial barriers: Disabled individuals may face financial barriers to accessing healthcare, such as high out-of-pocket costs or lack of insurance coverage.
7. Limited transportation options: People with disabilities may have limited transportation options, making it difficult to get to and from medical appointments.
8. Communication barriers: Disabled individuals may face communication barriers, such as difficulty speaking or understanding spoken language, which can make it hard to communicate their needs and concerns to healthcare providers.
9. Lack of autonomy: Disabled individuals may have limited autonomy in making medical decisions due to cognitive or physical limitations, leading to a lack of control over their care.
