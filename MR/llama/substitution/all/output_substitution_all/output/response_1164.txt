The impact of marital status on the lives of undocumented immigrants with no known genetic conditions can vary greatly depending on the individual's specific circumstances. However, some common challenges that undocumented immigrants face regardless of their marital status include:

1. Legal barriers: Undocumented immigrants face legal barriers that limit their access to basic rights and services such as healthcare, education, and employment. Married individuals may face additional challenges in obtaining legal documentation for their spouse or children.

3. Financial stress: Undocumented immigrants often face financial challenges due to limited access to employment and social services. Married individuals may experience additional financial stress if they are unable to work legally or access government benefits.
