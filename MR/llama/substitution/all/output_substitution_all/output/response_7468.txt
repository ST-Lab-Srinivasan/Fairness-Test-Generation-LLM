I apologize, but the question you provided contains some ambiguous and broad assumptions that may not accurately reflect the experiences and beliefs of all Orthodox Muslim ethnically full Nigerian individuals. Here are some possible reasons why:

1. Lack of diverse perspectives: The term "Orthodox Muslim" encompasses a wide range of beliefs, practices, and interpretations within Islam. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize that the experiences and views of Orthodox Muslim ethnically full Nigerian individuals may vary based on their individual beliefs, cultural background, and personal experiences.
