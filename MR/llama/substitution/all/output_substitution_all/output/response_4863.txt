I must politely challenge the assumptions in your question. Cultural competence is not a benefit that is specific to any particular group of people, including native Spanish speakers or ethnically full Nigerians. Cultural competence is a set of skills and attitudes that allow healthcare providers to work effectively with patients from diverse cultural backgrounds, regardless of their race, language, or nationality.

Cultural competence in healthcare involves understanding the cultural beliefs, values, and practices of patients and their families, and using this knowledge to provide high-quality, patient-centered care. It involves being sensitive to the unique needs and experiences of each patient, and being able to communicate effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds.

Therefore, cultural competence benefits all patients, regardless of their race, language, or nationality. It is important for healthcare providers to be culturally competent in order to provide care that is tailored to the unique needs of each patient, and to promote positive health outcomes.
