Addressing the specific needs of temporary visa holders and recent green card holders in the US, particularly those who are not single for a long time and in education, requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique circumstances. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create targeted programs: Design programs tailored to the specific needs of temporary visa holders and recent green card holders, such as language training, cultural orientation, and job skills development. These programs can help individuals navigate the US education system, find employment, and integrate into society.
2. Offer financial support: Provide financial aid, scholarships, or grants specifically for temporary visa holders and recent green card holders to help them cover the costs of education, including tuition fees, living expenses, and other associated costs.
3. Create a mentorship program: Pair recent immigrants with experienced professionals in their field of study or work experience. This can provide valuable guidance, support, and networking opportunities for individuals looking to advance their careers.
4. Develop cross-cultural communication skills: Offer courses or workshops that help individuals develop effective communication skills in a multicultural environment. This can help bridge the gap between different cultural groups and promote understanding and respect.
5. Facilitate access to healthcare: Provide information and resources on accessing affordable healthcare options, including public health insurance programs like Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Offering this support can help individuals prioritize their health and well-being while adjusting to life in a new country.
6. Create community spaces: Establish safe, inclusive spaces where individuals from diverse backgrounds can gather, socialize, and build connections. This can help foster a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of isolation or marginalization.
