Non-high-income cisgender people, those who identify with the gender they were assigned at birth and do not identify as transgender or non-binary, may face several challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the common difficulties they may encounter:

1. Lack of understanding and empathy from healthcare providers: Non-high-income cisgender people may feel that their experiences and concerns are not taken seriously by healthcare providers, who may be more focused on the needs of transgender and non-binary patients.
2. Limited access to gender-affirming care: While many health insurance plans now cover gender-affirming care for transgender and non-binary individuals, non-high-income cisgender people may not have access to these services due to lack of coverage or limited availability in their area.
3. Difficulty navigating complex medical systems: The healthcare system can be confusing and overwhelming for anyone, let alone those who are not familiar with the process. Non-high-income cisgender people may struggle to navigate the system and access the care they need.
4. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, stigma and discrimination against non-high-income cisgender people still exist in society, which can translate to negative experiences within the healthcare system. Healthcare providers may hold biases or make assumptions based on a person's gender identity.
5. Limited representation and cultural sensitivity: The healthcare system often lacks representation of non-high-income cisgender people, and their cultural backgrounds and experiences may not be taken into account when providing care. This can result in a lack of cultural sensitivity and understanding.
6. Limited availability of gender-specific services: While many healthcare providers offer gender-affirming care for transgender and non-binary individuals, non-high-income cisgender people may not have access to these services due to limited availability or lack of coverage.
7. Difficulty accessing mental health support: Non-high-income cisgender people may face challenges in accessing mental health support, such as counseling or therapy, due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area.
8. Limited access to reproductive healthcare:
