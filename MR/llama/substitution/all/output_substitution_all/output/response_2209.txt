Supporting the civic engagement of Native American recent temporary visa holders to the US and undocumented people can be done through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide access to legal resources: Many Native Americans and undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing legal resources due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about their rights, or fear of deportation. Organizations can provide free or low-cost legal services, including consultations with immigration lawyers, to help them understand their rights and options.
2. Offer language classes: Language barriers can be a significant obstacle for many Native Americans and undocumented immigrants in accessing civic engagement opportunities. Organizations can offer language classes or connect individuals with interpreters to help them communicate effectively.
3. Build community connections: Building relationships with local communities and organizations can help increase civic engagement among Native American and undocumented populations. This can be done by organizing community events, hosting cultural activities, or partnering with local organizations to provide resources and support.
4. Advocate for policy change: Organizations can advocate for policies that benefit Native Americans and undocumented immigrants, such as providing a pathway to citizenship, protecting their rights under the Voting Rights Act, or addressing the disproportionate impact of immigration enforcement on these communities.
5. Create cultural bridges: Building cultural bridges between different communities can help increase civic engagement among Native Americans and undocumented immigrants. This can be done by organizing cultural events, hosting community gatherings, or providing educational resources that highlight the histories and traditions of these communities.
6. Provide voter registration drives: Many Native American and undocumented immigrant communities face barriers in registering to vote due to lack of access to voter registration forms, limited transportation options, or fear of deportation. Organizations can provide voter registration drives, including distributing voter registration forms, providing transportation to polling stations, and educating community members about their voting rights.
7. Host town halls: Hosting town halls or community forums can provide a platform for community members to discuss issues affecting them and advocate for policy changes. These events can be conducted in various languages to accommodate the needs of diverse communities.
