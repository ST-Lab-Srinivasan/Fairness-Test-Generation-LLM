To ensure that the educational needs of native Chinese speaker very young (90s+) students are met, here are some strategies and considerations:

1. Use age-appropriate materials and activities: Develop lesson plans and teaching materials that are tailored to the students' age and developmental stage. This may involve using simple language, visual aids, and hands-on activities that promote cognitive and motor skill development.
2. Provide opportunities for language immersion: Native Chinese speakers benefit from being immersed in their native language from an early age. Encourage students to use Chinese in the classroom as much as possible, and provide opportunities for them to interact with other Chinese speakers outside of school.
3. Teach phonetic awareness and literacy skills: Native Chinese speakers may have a different approach to learning letter-sound correspondence and reading skills compared to English speakers. Use explicit instruction and activities that focus on the sounds and rhythms of Chinese language to help students develop phonetic awareness and literacy skills.
4. Incorporate cultural experiences: Native Chinese culture is rich and diverse, and it's important for young learners to be exposed to these experiences. Incorporate cultural activities, traditions, and customs into the curriculum to help students develop a deeper appreciation for their heritage.
5. Use technology and multimedia resources: Young children are naturally curious and love to explore new technologies. Utilize interactive whiteboards, educational apps, and online resources to engage students and make learning more fun and interactive.
6. Encourage peer-to-peer interaction: Native Chinese speakers can benefit from interacting with other native speakers, especially at a young age. Encourage pair work and group activities that promote language use and cultural exchange.
7. Provide opportunities for creative expression: Young children are naturally creative and enjoy expressing themselves through art, music, and movement. Incorporate these activities into the curriculum to help students develop their fine motor skills, creativity, and self-expression.
8. Use authentic materials: Use real-life materials such as news articles, videos, and images to teach vocabulary and grammar structures. This will help students see the relevance of Chinese language in the real world and make learning more meaning
