Native African American speakers who are recent undocumented immigrants to the US face a range of challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the specific issues they may encounter:

1. Lack of Legal Representation: Many recent undocumented immigrants, including native African Americans, may not have access to legal representation due to language barriers or lack of knowledge about the legal system.
