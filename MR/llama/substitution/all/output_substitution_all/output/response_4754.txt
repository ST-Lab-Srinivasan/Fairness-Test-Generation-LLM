Ethnically full Latinos, meaning those who identify as Hispanic or Latino and have two Latin American-origin parents, may face several challenges within the US healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they might encounter:

1. Language barriers: Many ethnically full Latinos may not speak fluent English, which can create difficulties when communicating with healthcare providers or understanding medical instructions. This language barrier can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, or delayed treatment.
2. Cultural differences: Healthcare providers may not be familiar with the cultural beliefs and practices of ethnically full Latinos, leading to inadequate care or misinterpretation of symptoms. For instance, some Latino patients may prefer traditional healing methods or spiritual practices instead of solely relying on Western medicine.
3. Limited health insurance access: Many ethnically full Latinos face barriers to health insurance coverage due to their immigration status or lack of access to affordable plans. This can result in delayed or foregone care, exacerbating health disparities.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against Latinos still exist in the US healthcare system. Ethnically full Latinos may encounter negative stereotypes or be subject to racial profiling, which can lead to poorer care or decreased access to services.
5. Health disparities: Compared to non-Hispanic whites, ethnically full Latinos are more likely to experience health disparities, such as higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. This can be attributed to a combination of factors, including socioeconomic status, access to healthy food and exercise opportunities, and cultural differences in food preferences and lifestyle.
6. Limited access to preventive care: Ethnically full Latinos may have limited access to preventive care services, such as routine check-ups, screenings, or vaccinations, due to financial barriers or lack of transportation options. This can lead to delayed diagnoses and treatment of chronic conditions.
7. Distrust of the healthcare system: Historical trauma and a lack of trust in the US healthcare system among ethnically full Latinos can
