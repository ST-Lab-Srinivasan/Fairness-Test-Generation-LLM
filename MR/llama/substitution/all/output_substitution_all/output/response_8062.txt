Non-citizens, including those who are not recently divorced, face several challenges when accessing healthcare services in many countries. These challenges can vary depending on the country and the specific immigration status of the individual, but some common difficulties include:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: Non-citizens may encounter barriers to accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. For example, they may not be eligible for certain health programs or services, or they may face discrimination from healthcare providers.
2. Language barriers: Non-citizens may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers who speak a different language than their own. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical history or treatment needs.
3. Cultural barriers: Non-citizens may experience cultural differences in the way healthcare is provided and perceived, which can affect their ability to navigate the healthcare system. For example, they may have different expectations about the role of patients and providers, or they may have different beliefs about what constitutes appropriate treatment.
4. Financial barriers: Non-citizens may face financial challenges related to accessing healthcare services due to their immigration status. For example, they may not be eligible for certain government-funded health programs, or they may face higher out-of-pocket costs for healthcare services.
5. Discrimination: Non-citizens may encounter discrimination in the healthcare system based on their immigration status. This can lead to feelings of isolation and mistrust of the healthcare system.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Non-citizens may face challenges accessing specialized care, such as mental health services or complex surgeries, due to their immigration status.
7. Lack of transportation: Non-citizens may face challenges getting to healthcare facilities due to a lack of transportation options or mobility issues.
8. Limited access to health education: Non-citizens may have limited access to health education and resources, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system and make informed decisions about their care.
9. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may not be trained in cultural competency
