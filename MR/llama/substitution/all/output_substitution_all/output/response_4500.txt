Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of documented Indian people, as it serves as a connection to their past, present, and future. It encompasses the customs, traditions, beliefs, values, and practices that have been passed down from generation to generation within an Indigenous community. Cultural heritage is essential for the identity, well-being, and resilience of documented Indian people, as it provides a sense of belonging, purpose, and meaning in their lives.
