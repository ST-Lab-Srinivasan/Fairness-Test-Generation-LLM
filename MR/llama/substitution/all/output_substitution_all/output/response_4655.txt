Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Mexican average earners are met is a complex challenge that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to improve access to healthcare for this population:

1. Increase public investment in healthcare: Mexico's public healthcare system, known as Seguro Popular, has been successful in providing affordable healthcare coverage to millions of people. However, the program faces funding challenges, and increasing public investment could help improve the quality and reach of services.
2. Implement a universal healthcare system: Mexico's healthcare system is currently based on a mixed model, with both public and private providers. Implementing a universal healthcare system could help ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare, regardless of their income level.
3. Increase the number of primary care providers: Many Mexican communities lack access to primary care providers, which can make it difficult for people to receive preventive care and manage chronic conditions. Increasing the number of primary care providers, particularly in rural areas, could help address this gap.
4. Promote community-based care: Community-based care, such as health centers and clinics, can provide more convenient and accessible healthcare services for Mexican average earners. These facilities can also serve as hubs for outreach and education programs, helping to promote healthy behaviors and disease prevention.
5. Develop telemedicine services: Telemedicine can help bridge the gap in access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas where clinics may be far away. Mexico could invest in telemedicine infrastructure and train healthcare professionals to provide remote consultations and monitoring.
6. Address social determinants of health: Many Mexican average earners face barriers to accessing healthcare due to factors such as poverty, lack of transportation, and poor living conditions. Addressing these social determinants of health could help improve access to care and overall health outcomes.
7. Increase public awareness and education: Public awareness campaigns can help promote healthy behaviors and disease prevention among Mexican average earners. Education programs could also be implemented to teach people how to navigate the healthcare system and make informed decisions about their care.
8. Encourage private sector
