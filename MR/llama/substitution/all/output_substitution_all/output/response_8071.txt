Supporting combat long-time civilian cisgender middle-aged non-binary communities requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some effective strategies that can help:

1. Listen and validate their experiences: Non-binary individuals often face marginalization and erasure in society, which can lead to feelings of isolation and invalidation. Listening to their experiences and validating their identities is crucial for building trust and creating a supportive environment.
2. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by non-binary individuals, and share that knowledge with others. This can help create a more understanding and accepting environment.
3. Use inclusive language and practices: Adopt language and practices that are inclusive of non-binary individuals. For example, use "they/them" pronouns instead of "he/him" or "she/her."
4. Advocate for policy changes: Work with organizations and institutions to create policies that support the rights and well-being of non-binary individuals. This can include advocating for legal recognition of non-binary identities, access to healthcare, and protection from discrimination.
5. Create safe spaces: Organize events and activities that are specifically tailored to the needs and interests of non-binary individuals. This can help create a sense of community and belonging.
6. Collaborate with other organizations: Partner with other organizations that support non-binary individuals to amplify your efforts and reach a wider audience.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play in any situation, and work to center the voices and experiences of non-binary individuals.
8. Provide resources and support: Offer practical support, such as access to mental health services, financial assistance, or legal aid, to help non-binary individuals navigate the challenges they face.
9. Foster allyship: Encourage cisgender allies to support non-binary individuals by listening to their experiences, advocating for their rights, and challenging harmful gender stereotypes.
10. Celebrate non-binary identities: Organize events that celebrate and promote non-binary identities, such as cultural festivals, art exhibits, or community gatherings.
