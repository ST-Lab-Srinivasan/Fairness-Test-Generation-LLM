Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Happily Long-Time Divorced Beginner Spanish Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of happily long-time divorced individuals, particularly those who are beginner Spanish speakers. This study aims to investigate the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of these individuals and how it influences their language learning journey.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can greatly affect an individual's identity, including their sense of belonging, values, beliefs, and attitudes (Grabski & Ziemele, 2016). For happily long-time divorced individuals, their cultural heritage can provide a sense of stability and continuity in their lives, especially during times of change and uncertainty (Komaki & Lucas, 2003). Moreover, research has found that language learning is closely tied to an individual's identity, as it can affect their self-esteem, motivation, and overall satisfaction with life (Laufer & Thorson, 2006).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with happily long-time divorced beginner Spanish speakers. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling, ensuring a diverse range of cultural backgrounds and language learning experiences. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for a thorough analysis of the participants' narratives.

Analysis:
Data analysis will involve an inductive thematic approach (Braun & Clarke, 2006), identifying patterns and themes within the participants' stories. The following codes will be used to guide the analysis:

1. Cultural heritage and identity
2. Language learning and identity
3. Divorce and identity
4. Stability and continuity
5. Motivation and self-esteem
6. Overall satisfaction with life

Expected Findings:
The findings of this study are expected to provide insights into the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of happily long-time divorced beginner Spanish speakers. Specifically, it is predicted that
