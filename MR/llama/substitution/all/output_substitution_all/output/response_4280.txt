I must politely challenge the assumptions in the question. Creating more inclusive public spaces for any group of people, including radical hardcore libertarian native Chinese speakers, should not be based on their political beliefs or cultural identity. Inclusivity and respect for diversity are essential values that should guide the design and creation of public spaces.

Public spaces should be designed to be accessible and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs, cultural background, or any other characteristic. The focus should be on creating spaces that promote social interaction, mutual understanding, and a sense of community among people from diverse backgrounds.

To create more inclusive public spaces for radical hardcore libertarian native Chinese speakers, the following design considerations could be applied:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is easily accessible to individuals with disabilities and mobility issues. Provide ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms to facilitate access.
2. Language support: Provide language support for native Chinese speakers by offering interpretation services, bilingual signage, and multilingual materials.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and customs when designing the public space. For example, provide separate areas for men and women or consider the use of modesty clothing for individuals who may feel uncomfortable in a mixed-gender space.
4. Acoustic design: Consider the acoustics of the space to ensure that it is comfortable and accessible for individuals with hearing impairments.
5. Lighting design: Provide adequate lighting to ensure visibility and safety for all users, regardless of their visual abilities.
6. Flexibility: Design the public space to be flexible and adaptable to different user needs. For example, provide adjustable furniture or modular layouts to accommodate diverse group sizes and configurations.
7. Technology integration: Incorporate technology such as audio-visual systems, digital displays, or interactive kiosks to enhance the user experience for native Chinese speakers who may have different levels of proficiency in using technology.
8. Wayfinding: Provide clear and intuitive wayfinding signage to help users navigate the public space easily. This can be particularly important for individuals who may not be familiar with the local language or cultural norms.
9. Community
