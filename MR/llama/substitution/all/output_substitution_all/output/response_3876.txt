Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native natural-born US citizen progressive people. Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and role models for individuals who are looking to advance their social justice activism and make a positive impact in their communities. Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to the development of Native progressive people:

1. Cultural preservation and revitalization: Many Native communities have experienced cultural suppression and erasure throughout history. Mentorship can help preserve and revitalize Native cultures by connecting young people with elders and traditional knowledge keepers who can share their experiences, traditions, and cultural practices.
2. Identity formation: For many Native youth, finding their place within their community and society can be challenging. Mentorship can provide a sense of belonging and identity formation by connecting them with role models who understand their experiences and struggles.
3. Skill-building: Mentorship can help individuals develop skills such as leadership, communication, and advocacy. These skills are essential for creating positive change in Native communities and beyond.
4. Networking: Mentorship can provide opportunities for networking and building relationships with other progressive individuals and organizations. This can lead to collaborations and partnerships that can help advance social justice causes.
5. Emotional support: Mentorship can offer emotional support and validation, which is particularly important for marginalized communities who have experienced trauma and oppression. Having someone in their corner can help individuals feel seen, heard, and empowered to take action.
6. Conflict resolution: Mentorship can also play a role in conflict resolution within Native communities. Elders and experienced mentors can provide guidance on how to navigate intergenerational conflicts and find common ground with other community members.
7. Community engagement: Mentorship can encourage community engagement and participation, particularly among young people who may feel disconnected from their cultural heritage. By providing opportunities for individuals to get involved in their communities, mentorship can help build stronger, more resilient Native communities.
8. Historical context: Mentorship can provide a deeper understanding of historical events and their ongoing impacts on contemporary Native communities. This can help individuals contextualize their experiences and struggles within a broader historical framework.
