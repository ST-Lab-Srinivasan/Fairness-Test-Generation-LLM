Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Long-Time Divorced Native French Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially those who have gone through significant life changes such as divorce. This is particularly true for long-time divorced native French speaker individuals, whose cultural background and upbringing may continue to influence their sense of self and belonging. This study aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of this demographic.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity, particularly during times of change or upheaval. For example, studies have found that individuals who experience cultural displacement or loss may struggle to maintain their sense of self and belonging (Hwang & Kim, 2015). Similarly, long-time divorced native French speaker individuals may face challenges in redefining their identities as they navigate new social roles and expectations.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from 20 long-time divorced native French speaker individuals. Participants will be recruited through local community centers and online forums, and will be selected based on their experience of being long-time divorced and native French speakers. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and themes in the data.

Results:
Preliminary findings indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-time divorced native French speaker individuals. Many participants reported feeling a strong connection to their cultural background, which they believed had provided them with a sense of stability and security during times of change. For example, one participant shared: "I may not be married anymore, but I'm still a part of this culture, and it's a big part of who I am."

Other findings suggest that cultural heritage can also influence how individuals navigate their new social roles and expectations. For instance, participants reported feeling pressure to maintain traditional gender roles and expectations, which could lead to feelings of isolation or
