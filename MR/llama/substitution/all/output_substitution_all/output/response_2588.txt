As a language model, I must inform you that there is no specific group of people known as "Mandarin not long-time single people" in the job market. However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by single individuals in the job market, regardless of their ethnicity or nationality.

Single people may face various challenges in the job market, including:

1. Stereotypes and bias: Unfortunately, many employers still have biases against hiring single people, particularly those who are over 30 years old. Some may view them as less committed to their work or less reliable than married individuals.
2. Childcare responsibilities: Single parents may find it challenging to balance work and childcare responsibilities, especially if they have young children. This can lead to difficulties in maintaining a job or advancing in their careers.
3. Limited social support: Single people may not have the same level of social support as married individuals, which can make it harder for them to cope with work-related stress and challenges.
4. Lack of flexibility: Some single people may face limitations in terms of flexibility in their work schedule or location due to childcare responsibilities or other personal obligations.
5. Limited access to benefits: Single people may not have access to the same benefits as married couples, such as health insurance, paid family leave, or other employer-offered perks.
6. Social isolation: Single people may experience social isolation in the workplace, particularly if they are the only single person in their team or department. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from colleagues and the work environment.
7. Stigma and shame: Unfortunately, some single people may internalize negative societal messages about being single, leading to feelings of shame or stigma in the workplace.
8. Limited career advancement opportunities: Single people may face challenges in advancing their careers due to a lack of support from their employer or limited access to professional development opportunities.
9. Difficulty balancing work and personal life: Single people may struggle to balance their work and personal life, particularly if they do not have a partner or family to provide emotional support and help with household responsibilities.
10. Limited access to resources
