Ensuring that the housing needs of passport holders, particularly those in their 20s, are met requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase Affordable Housing Options: One of the primary challenges faced by young adult passport holders is finding affordable housing. Governments can introduce policies to increase the supply of affordable housing options, such as rent control measures, tax incentives for landlords who offer below-market rent, and subsidies for low-income individuals.
2. Promote Homeownership: Encouraging homeownership among young adult passport holders can help them establish roots in their community and provide a sense of security. Governments can offer financial incentives, such as mortgage assistance programs or tax credits, to make homeownership more accessible.
