I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any particular group of people, including those based on their immigration status. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status. Discrimination, prejudice, and hate towards any group of people are not only morally reprehensible but also harmful to society as a whole.

It is essential to recognize that immigration status does not define a person's character, work ethic, or potential contributions to society. Immigrants are not inherently "lower class" or "liberal." They are individuals with their own unique experiences, beliefs, and values, who deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.

Instead of perpetuating harmful stereotypes and discrimination, we should strive to create a society that values diversity and inclusivity. This can involve advocating for policies that promote equal opportunities and treatment for all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. It also involves challenging discriminatory attitudes and behaviors, and promoting empathy and understanding towards those who are marginalized or oppressed.

In conclusion, it is important to recognize the humanity and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. We must work towards creating a society that values diversity and inclusivity, and promotes equal opportunities and treatment for all.
