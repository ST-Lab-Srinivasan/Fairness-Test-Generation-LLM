The impact of immigration status on the lives of not early pregnant (1st trimester) and long-time widowed people can be significant, particularly in the United States. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care, including prenatal care for pregnant individuals. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the fetus.
