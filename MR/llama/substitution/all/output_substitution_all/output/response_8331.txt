Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for recent refugees to the US, particularly those from a culturally European background, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve Refugees in the Planning Process: Refugees should be actively involved in the planning process of cultural celebrations to ensure their needs and preferences are met. This can be done by forming a committee comprising both refugees and non-refugees, where refugees have a say in the planning and execution of events.
2. Provide Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for event organizers and volunteers to ensure they understand the customs and practices of the refugee community. This can help avoid cultural faux pas and make the celebrations more comfortable for everyone involved.
3. Incorporate Refugee Traditions: Incorporate traditional clothing, food, music, and dance from the refugees' country of origin into the celebrations. This will help them feel more connected to their heritage and culture.
4. Create Interactive Activities: Organize interactive activities that allow refugees to share their stories and experiences with others. This can include workshops, panel discussions, or even a "refugee storytelling circle."
5. Promote Cross-Cultural Exchange: Encourage cross-cultural exchange between refugees and non-refugees by organizing events that bring both groups together. For example, you could host a potluck dinner where everyone brings a traditional dish from their culture to share.
6. Provide Language Support: Offer language support during cultural celebrations to help refugees communicate more effectively with non-refugees. This can be done by providing interpreters or translators, or even organizing language classes specifically for refugees.
7. Be Sensitive to Dietary Restrictions: Be mindful of dietary restrictions and provide vegetarian or halal options during cultural celebrations. This will help ensure that everyone can participate without feeling excluded or uncomfortable.
8. Create a Safe Space: Ensure that the celebrations are conducted in a safe and inclusive environment. This means being respectful of people's differences, avoiding discriminatory language or behavior, and providing support for those who may be struggling
