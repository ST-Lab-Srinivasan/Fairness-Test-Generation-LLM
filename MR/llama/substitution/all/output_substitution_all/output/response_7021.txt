As a family law attorney, I must inform you that there is no specific legal term for "not recently divorced permanent resident people" in the United States. However, I can provide some general information on the challenges that individuals may face in the legal system based on their marital status or residency status.

In the US legal system, couples who are married or have been in a long-term romantic relationship may face unique challenges when it comes to dividing assets and debts, as well as making decisions about child custody and support in the event of a divorce. These challenges can be particularly complex if one spouse has been out of the workforce or has not contributed financially to the marriage in the same way as the other spouse.

Similarly, permanent residents who have lived in the US for an extended period of time may face challenges when it comes to navigating the legal system, particularly if they are not familiar with US laws and regulations. For example, they may struggle to understand their rights and responsibilities as a non-citizen, or they may encounter difficulties when trying to access certain benefits or services that are only available to US citizens.

Some common challenges faced by individuals in these situations include:

1. Lack of legal representation: Individuals who are not recently divorced or do not have permanent residency status may not have access to legal representation, which can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
2. Limited understanding of US laws and regulations: As mentioned earlier, individuals who are not recently divorced or do not have permanent residency status may be unfamiliar with US laws and regulations, which can lead to confusion and mistakes when dealing with legal issues.
3. Language barriers: Individuals who are not fluent in English may face challenges communicating with legal professionals, court officials, and other parties involved in the legal system.
4. Limited access to benefits and services: Non-citizens may face limitations on their access to certain benefits and services, such as public assistance programs or social security benefits.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on marital status or residency status still exists in some areas of the legal system. Individuals may encounter biases or prejudices when
