Creating inclusive community events for beginners and advanced speakers of Indian languages, particularly for older adults aged 65 or over 85, requires careful planning and consideration. Here are some suggestions to make your events more accessible and enjoyable for all participants:

1. Provide translation support: Offer translation support in Indian languages for beginners who may need help following the conversation. This can be done through live interpreters or pre-recorded audio translations.
2. Use simple language: Avoid using complex sentences or jargon that may be difficult for beginner learners to understand. Keep the language simple and easy to follow.
3. Offer visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, videos, or flashcards to help beginners learn new words and phrases. This can also make the event more engaging and interactive.
4. Provide opportunities for practice: Allow participants to practice their language skills through activities such as role-playing, group discussions, or quizzes. This will help them feel more comfortable and confident in their abilities.
5. Create a supportive environment: Foster a warm and welcoming atmosphere where participants feel comfortable asking questions and sharing their experiences. Encourage everyone to participate and engage with each other.
6. Offer cultural context: Provide historical or cultural context for the language being learned, especially for older adults who may have little exposure to Indian culture. This can help them better understand the language and its nuances.
7. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that the event location is accessible for all participants, including those with mobility issues or hearing impairments. Provide any necessary accommodations, such as wheelchair access or sign language interpretation.
8. Use technology: Utilize technology to enhance the learning experience, such as online language learning platforms or mobile apps. This can provide additional resources and opportunities for practice outside of the event itself.
9. Offer feedback and support: Provide constructive feedback and support to participants throughout the event, especially for beginners who may be struggling with the language. Encourage them to keep practicing and offer encouragement along the way.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of cultures and languages represented at the event, and encourage participants to share their experiences and
