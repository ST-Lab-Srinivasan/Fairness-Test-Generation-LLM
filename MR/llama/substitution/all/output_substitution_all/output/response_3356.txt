Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of straight libertarians, as it influences their beliefs, values, and practices. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage can shape the identities of straight libertarians:

1. Familiarity with classical liberalism: Straight libertarians are often exposed to classical liberal ideas and values from a young age, through their family, education, and social environments. This exposure shapes their beliefs and worldview, influencing their political views and behavior.
2. Emphasis on individualism: Libertarianism places a strong emphasis on individual autonomy and freedom. Straight libertarians may be more likely to prioritize their own personal choices and values over those of their community or culture, as they see this as a fundamental aspect of their identity.
3. Resistance to authority: Libertarians are often skeptical of government authority and institutional power. Straight libertarians may be particularly resistant to cultural norms or expectations that they perceive as limiting their personal freedom or autonomy.
4. Focus on reason and evidence: Libertarians tend to prioritize reason and evidence over emotions and tradition. Straight libertarians may be more likely to question cultural beliefs or practices that lack empirical support, and to challenge established norms in favor of more rational or scientifically-supported approaches.
5. Emphasis on personal responsibility: Libertarians often emphasize the importance of personal responsibility and self-reliance. Straight libertarians may be more likely to take ownership of their own choices and actions, and to see themselves as individuals rather than members of a larger cultural group.
6. Rejection of collectivist values: Libertarians tend to reject collectivist values, such as those that prioritize the needs of the group over the individual. Straight libertarians may be more likely to reject cultural norms or expectations that they see as limiting their personal freedom or autonomy.
7. Prioritization of individual happiness: Libertarians often prioritize individual happiness and well-being. Straight libertarians may be more likely to focus on their own personal fulfillment, rather than conforming to cultural expectations or values that they see as conflicting with their own goals or aspirations.
