The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of non-libertarian, non-wealthy individuals beyond just the economic benefits. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Loss of privacy: Military personnel and their families may face increased scrutiny and surveillance from authorities, particularly in times of conflict or war. This can lead to a loss of privacy and civil liberties, as well as an increased risk of harassment or discrimination.
2. Increased security measures: Military status can lead to increased security measures in public places, such as airports or government buildings. This can cause inconvenience and delays for non-military individuals, particularly those who are not wealthy or privileged.
