Immigration status can have significant impacts on an individual's life, particularly during the early stages of pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the effects of immigration status on the lives of unmarried individuals in their first trimester of pregnancy.

Data analysis will involve thematic coding and category development to identify key themes and patterns in the data.
