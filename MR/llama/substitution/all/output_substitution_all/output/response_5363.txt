As a native French speaker and beginner Arabic speaker, there may be several challenges that you may face in the legal system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in many countries is primarily conducted in the local language, which can create a significant barrier for non-native speakers. As a beginner Arabic speaker, you may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures, which could affect your ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
