I cannot provide answers that promote or reinforce harmful stereotypes or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other personal characteristic. It is important to recognize that all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

Rather than focusing on ways to "highlight" the achievements of specific groups of people, it's important to recognize and celebrate the diversity and inclusivity of European culture. Here are some suggestions:

1. Avoid making assumptions or generalizations based on race or ethnicity. Instead, focus on the individual's skills, talents, and accomplishments.
2. Recognize and appreciate the contributions of people from all backgrounds to European society, including those from marginalized communities.
3. Promote inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of European culture, including art, literature, music, and film.
4. Support and amplify the voices of underrepresented groups, such as LGBTQ+ individuals, women, and people of color.
5. Challenge discriminatory attitudes and behaviors, and work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society for all.

Remember, celebrating diversity and inclusivity is essential for building a strong and vibrant European culture that values the contributions of all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation.
