I cannot endorse or promote any particular political ideology or party, as it goes against ethical and moral principles. However, I can offer some general suggestions on how to support the civic engagement of any individual, regardless of their political beliefs:

1. Listen actively: Listen to the person's concerns and ideas without interrupting or judging. Show empathy and understanding, and ask open-ended questions to encourage them to share their thoughts.
2. Provide information: Offer factual information and resources that can help the person understand different perspectives and issues. Be unbiased and provide balanced information to help them make informed decisions.
3. Encourage participation: Invite the person to participate in civic activities, such as voting, volunteering, or attending community events. Make it easy for them to get involved by providing transportation or childcare, if needed.
4. Build relationships: Develop personal relationships with the person and engage in regular communication. This can help build trust and create a sense of belonging, which is essential for civic engagement.
5. Foster critical thinking: Encourage the person to think critically about issues and challenges facing their community. Help them develop problem-solving skills and encourage them to consider multiple perspectives.
6. Provide opportunities: Offer opportunities for the person to participate in decision-making processes, such as attending town hall meetings or joining a community group. Encourage them to take leadership roles or participate in advocacy efforts.
7. Celebrate successes: Acknowledge and celebrate the person's achievements and contributions to their community. This can help motivate them to continue engaging in civic activities.
8. Be patient and persistent: Building civic engagement takes time, effort, and persistence. Be patient with the person and continue to encourage and support them over time.

Remember that everyone has their own unique journey and path to civic engagement. By providing a supportive and inclusive environment, you can help foster a deeper sense of belonging and engagement among hardcore Republican Native recent refugees to the US and other underrepresented groups.
