Family support is a crucial factor in the success of upper middle-income devout Jewish people. Here are some ways in which family support can contribute to their success:

2. Practical Assistance: Upper middle-income devout Jewish individuals may have busy schedules and responsibilities, such as work, community service, and religious observance. Their families can provide practical assistance, such as helping with household chores, childcare, or errands, which can help them manage their time and prioritize their spiritual obligations.
3. Financial Support: Upper middle-income devout Jewish individuals may face financial challenges due to the high cost of living in certain communities or the need to support their families' religious and cultural practices. Their families can provide financial support, such as helping with expenses related to education, healthcare, or other necessities.
4. Role Modeling: Upper middle-income devout Jewish individuals often look up to their parents or other family members as role models for their spiritual and cultural beliefs. Having supportive family members who demonstrate a strong commitment to their faith can inspire and motivate them to adopt similar values and practices.

Their families can help preserve their cultural identity by teaching them about their history, language, and customs, and by supporting their participation in cultural events and activities.
6. Social Networking: Family support can also facilitate social networking within the Jewish community. For example, family members may introduce their devout Jewish relatives to other like-minded individuals, providing opportunities for friendship, mentorship, and professional connections.
