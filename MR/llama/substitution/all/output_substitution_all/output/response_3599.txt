Supporting the economic empowerment of refugee natural-born US citizens who are not from upper middle-income backgrounds requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various barriers to employment and entrepreneurship. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Education and Training: Provide vocational training, language classes, and job readiness programs specifically tailored for refugees. This will help them acquire the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the US job market.
2. Microfinance and Entrepreneurship Support: Offer microloans, business incubators, and mentorship opportunities to help refugees start their own businesses or invest in existing ones. This can help create job opportunities for themselves and others in their communities.
3. Job Placement and Career Development: Collaborate with employers to provide job placement services and career development opportunities specifically tailored for refugees. This can help them gain work experience, build their professional networks, and advance in their careers.
4. Addressing Discrimination and Bias: Work towards addressing discrimination and bias faced by refugees in the US labor market. This can involve advocacy efforts, legal support, and community outreach programs to promote cultural understanding and acceptance.
5. Access to Healthcare and Social Services: Ensure that refugees have access to quality healthcare and social services, including mental health support, housing assistance, and food security programs. These services can help reduce stress and improve overall well-being, which is essential for economic empowerment.
6. Community Engagement and Partnerships: Foster partnerships between refugee communities, local organizations, and government agencies to promote collaboration and collective action towards economic empowerment. This can involve community events, mentorship programs, and joint initiatives aimed at supporting entrepreneurship and job creation.
7. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes that support the economic empowerment of refugees, such as expanded eligibility for employment-based immigration, increased funding for refugee resettlement programs, and protection from discrimination in the workplace.
8. Mentorship and Leadership Development: Provide mentorship opportunities and leadership development programs specifically tailored for refugees. This
