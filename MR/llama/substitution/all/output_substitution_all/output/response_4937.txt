Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for temporary visa holders in the US, particularly for devout Catholic individuals, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their beliefs and practices: It's essential to understand the beliefs and practices of the devout Catholics you want to include in your cultural celebrations. Learn about their customs, traditions, and rituals to ensure that your events are respectful and inclusive.
2. Involve them in the planning process: Invite devout Catholic individuals to participate in the planning process for your cultural celebrations. This will not only make them feel included but also give you valuable insights into their needs and preferences.
3. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for devout Catholics who may have specific dietary or spiritual needs. For example, offer vegetarian or vegan options for those who follow a plant-based diet, or provide quiet areas for prayer and reflection.
4. Celebrate their traditions: Incorporate the cultural traditions and practices of devout Catholics into your celebrations. This could include incorporating Catholic rituals, music, or art into your events.
5. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops on Catholicism to help non-Catholic attendees better understand the beliefs and practices of devout Catholics. This can help create a more inclusive and respectful environment for everyone involved.
6. Foster a sense of community: Encourage attendees to connect with one another and build relationships. This can be done through interactive activities, group discussions, or simply providing opportunities for people to mingle and get to know each other.
7. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and respectful space for devout Catholics to practice their faith without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could include designated prayer areas or quiet spaces for reflection.
8. Involve the local Catholic community: Reach out to the local Catholic church or other religious organizations to get involved in your cultural celebrations. This can help create a sense of unity and shared purpose among attendees.
9. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use language and terminology that is respectful and inclusive
