Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly during times of crisis such as a third-trimester pregnancy. The stress and uncertainty of immigration proceedings can affect a person's mental and physical health, as well as their ability to access essential services and support. In this scenario, we will explore the potential impacts of immigration status on the lives of recently pregnant (third trimester) not single for a long time people.

Impact on Mental Health:
The stress of immigration proceedings can take a significant toll on an individual's mental health, particularly during a high-risk pregnancy.

Additionally, the lack of access to adequate prenatal care and medical resources can further compromise an individual's physical health during pregnancy.

Impact on Access to Healthcare:
Immigration status can significantly impact an individual's ability to access essential healthcare services, including prenatal care. Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek medical attention due to fear of deportation or discrimination, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment. This can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby during pregnancy, particularly during times of crisis such as a third-trimester pregnancy.

Impact on Social Support:
Immigration status can also impact an individual's social support network during a high-risk pregnancy. Undocumented immigrants may be hesitant to seek help from friends and family due to fear of deportation or discrimination, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness. This can
