Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly when it comes to accessing basic rights and services. In Australia, there are approximately 3.5 million immigrants, including those who have recently become naturalized citizens. This research paper aims to explore the impact of immigration status on the lives of natural-born Australian citizen people who have recently naturalized as citizens.

Methodology:
This study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey was conducted among a sample of 500 natural-born Australian citizen individuals who had recently naturalized as citizens, along with 20 in-depth interviews with a subset of this sample. The survey included questions on demographic information, socioeconomic status, access to services and benefits, and perceived impact of immigration status on their lives. The in-depth interviews were conducted to gather more detailed insights into the participants' experiences and perceptions.

Findings:
The study found that naturalized citizens face significant challenges and barriers in accessing basic rights and services compared to their natural-born counterparts. These included difficulties in accessing healthcare, education, and employment opportunities, as well as experiencing discrimination and stigma due to their immigration status. Many participants reported feeling like they were "in limbo" between their old and new identities, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection from their communities.

The study also found that naturalized citizens often face additional challenges in terms of legal and bureaucratic barriers, including complex and time-consuming processes for obtaining identification documents, voting rights, and access to social security benefits. Many participants reported feeling frustrated with the lack of support and resources available to them, particularly those who had experienced trauma or difficulties in their country of origin.

Implications:
The findings of this study highlight the need for greater awareness and understanding of the challenges faced by naturalized citizens in Australia. It is essential that policies and programs are developed to address these issues and promote greater inclusion and support for this vulnerable population. This may involve improving access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities, as well as addressing legal and bureaucratic barriers to full citizenship.
