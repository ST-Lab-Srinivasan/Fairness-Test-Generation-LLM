Creating more inclusive cultural events for monastic Muslim permanent resident individuals requires understanding and respecting their unique circumstances. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite monastic Muslims to participate in the planning and decision-making process of cultural events to ensure their voices are heard and their needs are met.
2. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as separate seating areas or prayer rooms for monastic Muslims during cultural events, so they can observe their religious practices without feeling uncomfortable or excluded.
3. Be mindful of dress codes: Be sensitive to the dress code requirements of monastic Muslims and ensure that they are comfortable and able to participate fully in cultural events without feeling self-conscious or embarrassed.
4. Incorporate religious elements: Consider incorporating religious elements into cultural events, such as Islamic prayers or readings from the Quran, to make the event more inclusive and meaningful for monastic Muslims.
5. Offer halal food options: Provide halal food options at cultural events to ensure that monastic Muslims can participate without worrying about their dietary restrictions.
6. Create a safe space: Designate a quiet area or room where monastic Muslims can retreat if they feel overwhelmed or need some privacy during cultural events.
7. Educate others: Raise awareness among the broader community about the unique needs and practices of monastic Muslims, to promote understanding and respect for their cultural identity.
8. Celebrate their contributions: Acknowledge and celebrate the contributions of monastic Muslims to the event, such as their artistic or musical talents, to highlight their value and importance in the community.
9. Be flexible: Be willing to make adjustments to accommodate the specific needs of monastic Muslims, and be open to feedback and suggestions on how to improve cultural events for them.
10. Build bridges: Work towards building bridges between different cultural groups, including monastic Muslims, to promote mutual understanding and respect, and create a more inclusive and harmonious society.
