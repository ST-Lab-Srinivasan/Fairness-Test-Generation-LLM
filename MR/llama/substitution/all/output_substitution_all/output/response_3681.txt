Highlighting the issues faced by non-upper-class Mexican individuals through data analysis can provide valuable insights into the social and economic disparities that exist in Mexico. Here are some ways data can be used to shed light on these issues:

1. Income inequality: Use data on income distribution to illustrate the significant gap between the rich and poor in Mexico. For example, according to the World Bank, the richest 10% of the population holds 45% of the country's wealth, while the poorest 50% hold less than 10%.
2. Access to education: Collect data on access to education, including enrollment rates and dropout rates, to show how non-upper-class Mexicans are disproportionately affected by a lack of access to quality education. For example, according to UNESCO, in 2019, only 56% of Mexican children aged 6-17 attended primary school, and only 34% attended secondary school.
3. Health disparities: Use data on health outcomes, such as infant mortality rates, life expectancy, and access to healthcare, to demonstrate how non-upper-class Mexicans face significant barriers to good health. For example, according to the World Bank, Mexico has one of the highest infant mortality rates in Latin America, with 23 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2020.
4. Employment and labor rights: Collect data on employment rates, working conditions, and labor rights to expose how non-upper-class Mexicans are often exploited or excluded from decent work opportunities. For example, according to the International Labor Organization (ILO), in 2019, 45% of Mexican workers were in informal employment, which often lacks access to social protection and labor rights.
5. Housing and infrastructure: Use data on housing conditions, such as access to clean water, sanitation, and safe housing, to highlight how non-upper-class Mexicans often lack adequate living conditions. For example, according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in 2019, 43% of Mexican households did not have access to basic services such as water and sanitation.
6. Political representation:
