Non-low-income mixed-English heritage individuals face a range of challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: Mixed-English heritage individuals may have varying levels of proficiency in English, which can create language barriers when communicating with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications about their medical history, symptoms, or treatment options.
2. Cultural insensitivity: Healthcare providers may not be aware of the cultural practices and beliefs of mixed-English heritage individuals, which can result in inadequate care or mistreatment. For example, some cultures may have specific dietary restrictions or beliefs about medical treatments that are not taken into account by healthcare providers.
3. Discrimination: Mixed-English heritage individuals may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, or cultural identity. This can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and reluctance to seek medical care.
4. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce may not reflect the diversity of mixed-English heritage individuals, leading to a lack of representation and understanding of their unique needs and experiences.
5. Limited access to care: Mixed-English heritage individuals may face barriers to accessing medical care due to systemic inequalities or lack of resources in their communities. This can result in delayed diagnosis or treatment for chronic conditions, exacerbating health disparities.
6. Stigma and shame: Mixed-English heritage individuals may experience stigma and shame related to their cultural identity, which can affect their mental health and well-being. This can also impact their willingness to seek medical care or disclose personal information to healthcare providers.
7. Lack of culturally competent care: Healthcare providers may not be trained in culturally competent care, which can result in a lack of understanding of the unique needs and experiences of mixed-English heritage individuals. This can lead to inadequate care or mistreatment.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Mixed-English heritage individuals may face barriers to accessing specialized medical care, such as cardiologists or oncologists,
