Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are newly pregnant or in their first trimester. This study aims to explore the experiences of immigrants in the early stages of pregnancy and how their immigration status affects their lives.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that immigration status can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's mental and physical health, particularly during pregnancy (1,2). Immigrants who are undocumented or have uncertain immigration status may face additional stressors such as fear of deportation, lack of access to healthcare, and social isolation (3,4). These stressors can lead to higher levels of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues during pregnancy (5,6).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, employing in-depth interviews with immigrant women who are pregnant or have recently given birth. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare providers that serve immigrant populations. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Expected Results:
We expect to find a range of experiences among immigrant women during pregnancy and the early postpartum period, including challenges related to immigration status, access to healthcare, and social support. Specifically, we anticipate finding higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression among undocumented or uninsured immigrants compared to those with more stable immigration status. We also expect to find differences in birth outcomes and breastfeeding practices based on immigration status.

Implications for Practice:
This study has important implications for healthcare providers, policymakers, and community-based organizations that serve immigrant populations. Findings can inform the development of culturally sensitive and trauma-informed care for pregnant and postpartum immigrants, as well as advocacy efforts to address systemic barriers to healthcare access and social support.

Conclusion:
Immigration status has a significant impact on the lives of newly pregnant or early postpartum immigrant
