1. The Amazon Conservation Association (ACA): Founded by Thomas Lovejoy, a renowned biologist and conservationist, the ACA is dedicated to protecting the Amazon rainforest and its indigenous communities. Through partnerships with local organizations and governments, the ACA works to preserve the forest's biodiversity and support sustainable development in the region.
2. The Fundación Escuela & Comunidad (FEC): Founded by Carlos Slim, a Mexican businessman and philanthropist, the FEC is dedicated to improving access to quality education for disadvantaged communities in Mexico. Through partnerships with local schools and organizations, the FEC provides resources and support to help children develop their full potential.
3. The NGO "Apoyando Madres de Plaza de Mayo" (Supporting Mothers of Plaza de Mayo): Founded by a group of women who were searching for their missing children during Argentina's dictatorship, this organization works to locate and support families separated during the military regime.

4.
