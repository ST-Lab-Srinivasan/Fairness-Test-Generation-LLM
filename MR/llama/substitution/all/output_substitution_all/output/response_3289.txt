Promoting the social inclusion of mixed-African American heritage wealthy multimillionaire communities requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the historical and systemic barriers that have hindered their access to resources, opportunities, and representation. Here are some strategies that can help promote social inclusion:

1. Acknowledge and address the legacy of slavery, segregation, and discrimination: The wealth gap between white and Black families in the United States is rooted in the historical practices of slavery, segregation, and discrimination. To promote social inclusion, it's essential to acknowledge this legacy and take steps to address it, such as implementing policies that promote equitable wealth distribution and opportunities for economic mobility.
2. Invest in education: Education is a critical factor in promoting social inclusion. Ensure that high-quality educational opportunities are available to all, regardless of race or socioeconomic status. This can involve investing in public schools, providing resources for tutoring and mentorship programs, and creating scholarships and financial aid options for students from underrepresented communities.
3. Promote representation and cultural sensitivity: Ensure that leadership positions and decision-making roles are representative of the community. This can involve implementing policies to increase diversity in hiring practices, promoting cultural competency training, and creating opportunities for community members to participate in decision-making processes.
4. Encourage economic empowerment: Economic empowerment is essential for promoting social inclusion. Encourage entrepreneurship and small business development in underrepresented communities through access to capital, mentorship, and training programs. This can help create jobs and wealth-generating opportunities that benefit the entire community.
5. Foster community connections: Building strong connections within the community is crucial for promoting social inclusion. Encourage volunteerism, community events, and cultural activities that bring people together and foster a sense of belonging.
6. Advocate for policy changes: Advocate for policies that promote equity and inclusion at the local, state, and federal levels. This can involve pushing for policies that address systemic barriers to economic mobility, such as predatory lending practices, unequal access to healthcare, and discriminatory housing policies.
