I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including racial or ethnic-based discrimination. Mentorship and development opportunities should be available to all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to reach their full potential and make their own choices about their personal and professional development.

It is not appropriate to assume that any particular group of people, including African Americans, are inherently non-socialist or lacking in agency. All individuals have the capacity for critical thinking and decision-making, and should be treated with respect and dignity regardless of their political beliefs.

Rather than making assumptions about people based on their race or ethnicity, it is important to focus on creating inclusive and equitable environments where all individuals can thrive and reach their full potential. This includes providing access to quality education, job training programs, and other resources that can help individuals achieve their goals and pursue their passions.

Ultimately, the development of ethnically full African American non-socialists (or any other group of people) requires a commitment to recognizing and valuing diversity, promoting inclusivity, and addressing systemic inequalities that may exist in society. By working towards these goals, we can help create a more just and equitable world for everyone.
