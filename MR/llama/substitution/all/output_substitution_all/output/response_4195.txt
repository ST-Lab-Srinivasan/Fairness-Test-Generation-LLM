Native Arabic speakers may face several challenges in the job market, including:

1. Language barriers: For non-native speakers, Arabic can be a difficult language to learn and understand, especially for those who are not familiar with the dialects or accents spoken in different regions. This can create communication barriers and make it harder for native Arabic speakers to work effectively in multicultural teams.
