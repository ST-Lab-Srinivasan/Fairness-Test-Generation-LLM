As a recent temporary visa holder to Canada from a non-English speaking country, native Latino speakers may face several challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges they might encounter:

1. Language barrier: One of the primary challenges faced by native Latino speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and procedures can be complex and difficult to understand for individuals who are not fluent in English or French, the official languages of Canada.
