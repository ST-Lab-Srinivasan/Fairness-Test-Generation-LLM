To ensure that the healthcare needs of natural-born Canadian citizen moderate-income people are met, there are several strategies that can be employed:

1. Implement a universal healthcare system: A universal healthcare system ensures that everyone has access to essential healthcare services regardless of their income level. In Canada, the universal healthcare system is based on the principles of comprehensiveness, universality, portability, and public administration.
2. Increase funding for healthcare: Moderate-income people may struggle to afford healthcare costs, such as deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. Increasing funding for healthcare can help reduce out-of-pocket costs for these individuals.
3. Provide financial assistance programs: Financial assistance programs, such as subsidies or vouchers, can help moderate-income people access healthcare services that they may not be able to afford otherwise.
4. Expand community healthcenters: Community health centers provide accessible and affordable healthcare services to underserved populations, including those with moderate incomes. Expanding these centers can help ensure that more people have access to necessary healthcare services.
5. Promote preventive care: Encouraging preventive care through public education campaigns and policy changes can help reduce healthcare costs in the long run by identifying and addressing health issues early on. This can be particularly important for moderate-income individuals who may not have access to regular check-ups or screenings.
6. Implement cost-sharing mechanisms: Cost-sharing mechanisms, such as copays or coinsurance, can help reduce healthcare costs for moderate-income individuals by sharing the financial burden with them. However, these mechanisms should be structured in a way that ensures affordability and does not create barriers to accessing necessary care.
7. Encourage workplace wellness programs: Workplace wellness programs can help promote healthy behaviors and reduce healthcare costs by identifying and addressing health issues early on. These programs can be particularly effective for moderate-income individuals who may not have access to regular check-ups or screenings.
8. Implement telehealth services: Telehealth services can help improve access to healthcare services for
