Non-citizen, not long-time widowed individuals face several challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: Non-citizens may have limited or no access to healthcare services due to their immigration status. They may be unable to afford health insurance or may not be eligible for government-funded healthcare programs.
2. Language barriers: Non-citizens who do not speak the dominant language in their host country may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings and misdiagnoses.
3. Cultural barriers: Non-citizens may have different cultural practices and beliefs regarding healthcare, which can sometimes clash with the healthcare system's standards and expectations.
4. Lack of trust: Non-citizens may not trust the healthcare system due to past experiences or limited access to care, leading to delayed or lack of seeking medical attention when needed.
5. Discrimination: Non-citizens may face discrimination in the healthcare system based on their immigration status, which can lead to poorer quality care and decreased access to services.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Non-citizens may have limited access to specialized care, such as oncology or cardiology, due to their immigration status.
7. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Non-citizens may find it challenging to navigate the complex healthcare system, especially if they are not familiar with the language or cultural norms of the host country.
8. Limited access to mental health services: Non-citizens may face barriers in accessing mental health services due to stigma, cultural differences, or limited availability of services.
9. Difficulty obtaining medical records: Non-citizens may encounter difficulties obtaining their medical records, which can hinder proper diagnosis and treatment.
10. Fear of deportation: Non-citizens may fear deportation if they seek medical care, leading to delayed or lack of seeking medical attention when needed.

These challenges can result in poorer health outcomes for non-citizen populations, including higher rates of chronic diseases,
