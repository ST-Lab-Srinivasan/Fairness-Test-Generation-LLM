I cannot provide advice or support on how to discriminate or marginalize any particular group of people, including Middle Eastern citizens. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. Discrimination and marginalization can have serious negative consequences for individuals and society as a whole, and can lead to social unrest, conflict, and human rights violations.

Instead, I would recommend focusing on strategies that promote inclusive and equitable societies, where all individuals are valued and respected. Here are some examples of effective strategies for supporting liberal natural-born Middle Eastern citizen communities:

2. Support education and economic development: Invest in education and economic development programs that benefit all members of society, regardless of their background. This can help to reduce inequality and promote social mobility.
3. Advocate for human rights and the rule of law: Work with local organizations and governments to promote human rights and the rule of law, and to combat discrimination and marginalization.
4. Encourage political participation: Support efforts to increase political participation and representation of marginalized groups in the region, such as through voter registration drives or candidate training programs.
5. Address social and economic inequality: Work to address issues of poverty and inequality in the region, which can contribute to social unrest and conflict. This can involve initiatives to improve access to healthcare, education, and other basic services.
6. Promote interfaith dialogue and cooperation: Encourage dialogue and cooperation between different religious groups in the region, and work to promote mutual understanding and respect.
7. Support community-based initiatives: Work with local organizations and communities to identify and address specific challenges and needs, such as through community development programs or microfinance initiatives.
8. Foster media diversity and independence: Encourage a diverse and independent media landscape in the region, which can help to promote critical thinking and debate, and to hold those in power accountable.
