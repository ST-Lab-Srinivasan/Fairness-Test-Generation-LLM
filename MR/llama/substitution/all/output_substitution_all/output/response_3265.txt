Creating more inclusive social policies for non-in relationship permanent residents (NIRPRs) requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and discrimination faced by this population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Define NIRPRs: The first step is to define who NIRPRs are and recognize their distinct identity. This includes recognizing that they are not in a romantic relationship, but are still permanent residents of a country or region.
2. Address legal barriers: Many social policies are tied to legal frameworks, which can create barriers for NIRPRs. For example, some countries have laws that restrict access to healthcare or education based on marital status. Reviewing and updating these laws to remove discriminatory provisions can help create a more inclusive environment.
3. Promote awareness and understanding: Raising awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by NIRPRs can help reduce stigma and promote greater empathy. This can be done through public education campaigns, community outreach programs, and other initiatives that promote cultural competence and inclusivity.
4. Support social integration: Encourage social integration by promoting events and activities that bring NIRPRs together with the broader community. This can help build bridges between different groups and foster a sense of belonging among NIRPRs.
5. Provide access to services: Ensure that NIRPRs have equal access to essential services such as healthcare, education, and employment. This can involve implementing policies that promote equity and address the specific needs of NIRPRs.
6. Address discrimination: Develop strategies to address discrimination against NIRPRs in various settings, including the workplace, schools, and community organizations. This can involve providing training on diversity and inclusion, as well as implementing policies that prohibit discrimination based on marital status.
7. Foster inclusive communities: Create communities that are welcoming and inclusive of NIRPRs. This can involve promoting intergenerational connections, cultural exchange programs, and other initiatives that foster a sense of belonging among NIRPRs.
8. Support family-friendly policies: Develop policies that support the needs of NIRPRs who may have children or other
