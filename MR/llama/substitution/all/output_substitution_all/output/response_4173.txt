Ensuring that the voices of beginner Chinese speakers are heard in decision-making processes is crucial to promote inclusivity and diversity. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that the learners feel comfortable and encouraged to participate in discussions. This can be done by creating a supportive atmosphere, providing opportunities for them to practice speaking and listening, and offering constructive feedback.
