Low-earning natural-born Caribbean citizen people may face several challenges within the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Due to financial constraints, these individuals may struggle to afford legal representation or access to legal aid services, which can hinder their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
2. Discrimination and bias: Historically, Caribbean people have faced discrimination and bias within the legal system, particularly in relation to issues of race, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of trust in the legal system.
3. Limited cultural competency: The legal system may not always take into account the unique cultural practices and beliefs of Caribbean people, which can result in misunderstandings and misapplications of the law.

5. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The legal system may not always be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of Caribbean people, which can result in misunderstandings and misapplications of the law.
6. Limited access to justice: Caribbean people may face barriers to accessing justice, such as lack of transportation or childcare, which can make it difficult to attend court hearings or meet legal deadlines.
7. Lack of legal representation: Many Caribbean people cannot afford legal representation, which can result in a lack of advocacy and support within the legal system.
8. Limited understanding of legal procedures: Caribbean people may have limited knowledge of legal procedures and processes, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
9. Lack of trust in the legal system: Historical and ongoing discrimination against Caribbean people within the legal system can lead to a lack of trust in the system, making it difficult for individuals to access justice.
