However, in general, immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic background or political beliefs. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal and financial stability: Depending on their immigration status, individuals may face uncertainty regarding their legal rights and protections, as well as their access to financial resources such as employment, housing, and healthcare.
2. Social isolation and discrimination: Non-citizens may experience social isolation and discrimination due to their immigration status, which can lead to feelings of loneliness, stigma, and marginalization.
3. Limited access to education and job opportunities: Depending on their immigration status, individuals may face barriers to accessing educational resources and job opportunities, which can limit their future prospects and earning potential.
4. Separation from family and community: Non-citizens may be separated from their families and communities due to immigration restrictions, which can have emotional and psychological impacts on their well-being.
5. Healthcare access and mental health: Non-citizens may face challenges in accessing healthcare services, particularly if they are undocumented or have limited legal status. This can lead to poorer mental health outcomes and reduced access to necessary medical care.
6. Criminalization and detention: Depending on their immigration status, individuals may be at risk of criminalization and detention, which can result in significant harm to their well-being and human rights.
7. Lack of representation and advocacy: Non-citizens may face barriers in accessing legal representation and advocacy services due to their immigration status, which can exacerbate the challenges they face.
8. Internalized oppression: Non-citizens may internalize the oppressive messages and experiences they encounter due to their immigration status, leading to self-blame, shame, and low self-esteem.
