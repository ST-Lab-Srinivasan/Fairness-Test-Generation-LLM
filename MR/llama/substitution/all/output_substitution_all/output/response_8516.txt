As a language model, I can suggest several legislative changes that could potentially benefit beginner French speaker active-duty communities:

1. Language training support: Provide additional resources and support for military personnel to learn and improve their French language skills, such as language classes, tutors, and language immersion programs.
2. Cultural exchange programs: Organize cultural exchange programs that allow military personnel to interact with French-speaking communities abroad, promoting mutual understanding and respect between the military and local populations.
3. Language proficiency testing: Develop standardized language proficiency tests for French speakers in the military, allowing for easier assessment and tracking of progress towards fluency.
4. Language learning incentives: Offer incentives to encourage military personnel to learn French, such as bonuses or promotions for those who demonstrate proficiency in the language.
5. Interagency cooperation: Encourage interagency cooperation between the military and French-speaking countries' governments, allowing for more effective communication and collaboration on issues of mutual interest.
6. Language training infrastructure: Invest in language training infrastructure, such as language learning software, apps, and online resources, to provide military personnel with access to high-quality language learning tools.
7. French language immersion programs: Establish immersion programs that allow military personnel to live and work in a French-speaking environment for extended periods, promoting fluency and cultural understanding.
8. Language skills recognition: Develop a system to recognize and validate the language skills of military personnel, allowing them to demonstrate their proficiency and gain credits or certificates recognizable across different branches of the military.
9. Language-related training opportunities: Provide language-related training opportunities for military personnel, such as translation and interpretation courses, cultural competency training, and language teaching certification programs.
10. Language mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair beginner French speakers with more proficient speakers, providing guidance and support in their language learning journey.

By implementing these legislative changes, the military can better support beginner French speaker active-duty communities, fostering a stronger understanding of the French language and culture, and improving communication and collaboration between the military and French-speaking countries' governments.
