Creating more inclusive social policies for South American trans individuals requires a comprehensive and multifaceted approach that addresses the specific challenges and discrimination faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Listen to the community: It is essential to listen to the experiences, needs, and concerns of trans individuals in South America. This involves conducting research and engaging with local organizations and communities to gain a deeper understanding of their realities.
2. Acknowledge the diversity of trans identities: Trans individuals are not a homogeneous group, and policies should recognize and respect this diversity. This includes acknowledging the differences between gender identity and expression, and recognizing the intersectionality of trans identities with other social determinants such as race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
3. Address discrimination and violence: Trans individuals in South America often face high levels of discrimination and violence, which can lead to poor mental and physical health outcomes. Policies should aim to prevent discrimination and violence against trans individuals, including through education and awareness-raising campaigns.
4. Advocate for access to healthcare: Trans individuals in South America often face barriers when seeking medical care, including lack of knowledge and training among healthcare providers, and limited access to gender-affirming care. Policies should advocate for increased access to quality healthcare for trans individuals, including hormone replacement therapy and gender-affirming surgeries.
5. Promote inclusive education: Trans individuals in South America often face discrimination and harassment in schools, which can lead to poor academic performance and social isolation. Policies should promote inclusive education that recognizes and respects the diversity of gender identities, including through training for teachers and school administrators.
6. Advocate for legal recognition: Trans individuals in South America often face legal barriers that prevent them from fully exercising their rights, such as lack of legal recognition of their gender identity. Policies should advocate for legal recognition of trans identities, including through the adoption of gender identity laws and policies.
7. Address economic inequality: Trans individuals in South America often face significant economic barriers, including limited access to employment and housing opportunities.
