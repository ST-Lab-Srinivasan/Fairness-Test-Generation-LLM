Social inclusion of beginner English speakers who are not in a relationship can be challenging, but there are several ways to support and encourage them:

1. Language Exchange Programs: Organize language exchange programs where beginner English speakers can practice speaking with native English speakers or more advanced learners. This helps build confidence and provides an opportunity for socialization.
2. Conversation Clubs: Create conversation clubs where beginners can practice speaking in a relaxed atmosphere. These clubs can be held weekly, biweekly, or monthly, depending on the interest of the participants.
3. Social Events: Host social events such as potlucks, game nights, or movie nights. These events provide opportunities for beginners to interact with each other and practice their English skills in a relaxed setting.
4. Volunteer Opportunities: Encourage beginners to volunteer for local organizations or charities. This not only helps them practice their English skills but also provides an opportunity to give back to the community.
5. Online Communities: Create online communities or forums where beginner English speakers can connect with each other, share experiences, and practice their language skills.
6. Language Learning Apps: Encourage beginners to use language learning apps such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone. These apps provide interactive lessons and exercises that help learners improve their English skills at their own pace.
7. Cultural Events: Host cultural events such as festivals, concerts, or art exhibitions. These events provide opportunities for beginners to practice their English skills while learning about different cultures.
8. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs where more advanced learners can mentor beginner English speakers. This helps build relationships and provides guidance and support to the beginners.
9. Language Camps: Organize language camps or workshops where beginners can practice their English skills in a fun and interactive environment. These camps provide an opportunity for socialization and language learning in a structured setting.
10. Community Outreach: Reach out to local communities, schools, or organizations to promote the inclusion of beginner English speakers. This helps raise awareness about the importance of language learning and provides opportunities for beginners to connect with each other.
