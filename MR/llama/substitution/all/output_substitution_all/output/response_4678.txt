It is important to note that ethnicity and race are complex and multifaceted concepts, and there is no one-size-fits-all experience for any particular group. However, here are some potential challenges faced by employed ethnically full European people in the healthcare system:

1. Tokenization: Employed ethnically full Europeans may face tokenization or stereotyping within the healthcare system. They may be seen as "representatives" of their ethnic group, rather than as individuals with their own unique experiences and perspectives.

7. Limited access to mental health services: Employed ethnically full Europeans may face barriers when accessing mental health services. For example, they may encounter language barriers or have difficulty navigating a healthcare system that is not designed with their cultural needs in mind.
