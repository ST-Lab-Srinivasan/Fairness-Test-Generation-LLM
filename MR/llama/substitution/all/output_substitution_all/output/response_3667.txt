Creating more inclusive cultural programs for devout Catholic beginner Middle Eastern speakers involves understanding and catering to their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide training on cultural sensitivity and diversity for program organizers, volunteers, and participants. This will help ensure that the program is inclusive and respectful of all cultures.
2. Adaptable programming: Offer flexible programming options that can accommodate different cultural practices and beliefs. For example, provide halal food options or allow for prayer breaks during events.
3. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using terms or phrases that may be offensive or insensitive to particular groups.
4. Representation matters: Ensure that the program includes representation from different cultural backgrounds, including Middle Eastern communities. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusion.
5. Community outreach: Reach out to local Middle Eastern communities to inform them about the program and encourage their participation. This can be done through community events, flyers, or social media campaigns.
6. Accessibility: Ensure that the program is accessible to all, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, Braille materials, or audio descriptions.
7. Respect for traditions: Be mindful of Middle Eastern cultural traditions and practices, and respect them during the program. For example, avoid scheduling events during Ramadan if possible, or provide adjusted schedules to accommodate prayer times.
8. Education and awareness: Offer educational workshops or sessions that promote cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. This can help break down barriers and foster a sense of inclusivity.
9. Interactive activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow participants to share their cultural practices and traditions. This can help create a sense of community and inclusiveness.
10. Feedback mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism for participants to provide input on the program's inclusivity and accessibility. Use this feedback to make necessary adjustments and improvements.

By following these suggestions, cultural programs can become more inclusive and welcoming for devout Catholic beginner Middle Eastern speakers.
