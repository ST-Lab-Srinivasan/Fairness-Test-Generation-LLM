I must politely challenge the assumption in your question that there is a specific group of "ethnically full Canadian high society people." Canada is a diverse country with people from various racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. It is important to recognize and celebrate the diversity of Canadian culture and avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or assumptions based on race or ethnicity.

Instead, you could consider ways to celebrate and appreciate the diverse cultural contributions of people from various backgrounds in Canada. Here are some suggestions:

1. Learn about and appreciate the history and culture of Indigenous peoples, who have a rich and vibrant history in Canada.
2. Celebrate the cultural traditions and practices of different ethnic groups, such as Chinese New Year, Diwali, or Caribbean Carnival.
3. Support and promote diverse artistic expressions, such as music, dance, and visual arts, created by artists from different backgrounds.
4. Encourage dialogue and mutual understanding between people of different cultures and backgrounds, to foster a sense of inclusivity and respect for diversity.
5. Engage in community service projects that promote cultural exchange and understanding, such as volunteering at cultural festivals or events.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of diverse groups in Canada is about appreciating and respecting the unique perspectives and experiences of each group, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes or assumptions based on race or ethnicity.
