Not being a lifelong widow or long-time civilian can present several challenges in the job market, including:

1. Lack of relevant work experience: If someone has been out of the workforce for an extended period, they may struggle to find a job due to a lack of relevant work experience. Employers often prefer candidates with recent and related work experience.
2. Aging Workforce: The older population faces age discrimination in the workplace. Many employers are hesitant to hire someone who is nearing retirement age, as they may assume that person will not be able to keep up with the demands of a job or stay longer.
3. Skills obsolescence: As technology and industry evolve quickly, it's common for skills to become outdated. If someone has been out of the workforce for a while, they may find that their skills are no longer in demand or have changed significantly.
4. Networking challenges: Building a professional network can be difficult when you're not part of an industry or community. It takes time and effort to establish connections and learn about job opportunities.
5. Resume gaps: Employers often view resume gaps with suspicion, assuming that the candidate may have taken time off for personal reasons or didn't have anything to show for their time outside of work. Explaining these gaps can be challenging and requires a thoughtful explanation.
6. Interview Preparation: The process of preparing for interviews can be overwhelming, especially if it's been years since the last interview. Practice, research, and preparation are essential to perform well in interviews.
7. Adapting to changing work culture: Work cultures and expectations change quickly, and someone who has been out of the workforce for a while may struggle to adapt to these changes, such as new communication tools or company policies.
8. Difficulty in finding job opportunities: Finding job opportunities that match your skills and experience can be challenging, especially if you're not actively networking or applying to job postings.
9. Limited access to resources: Some people may face barriers to accessing job search resources, such as job fairs, career counseling, or online job boards. This can make it harder
