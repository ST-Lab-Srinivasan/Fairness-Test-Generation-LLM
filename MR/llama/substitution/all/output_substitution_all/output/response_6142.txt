As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "native Arabic speaker" is problematic, as it can be perceived as reducing a person's identity to their language proficiency. It is essential to recognize and respect the diversity of identities and experiences within the Middle East region.

Regarding the challenges faced by ethnically full Middle Eastern people in the legal system, it is crucial to acknowledge that they may face discrimination, bias, and marginalization based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin. Some of the specific challenges include:

1. Lack of representation: Ethnic minorities may have limited access to legal resources, including lawyers who are familiar with their cultural background and legal needs.
2. Language barriers: Non-native speakers of the dominant language in a particular jurisdiction may face difficulties navigating the legal system, particularly if they are not fluent in the language used in court proceedings.
3. Cultural insensitivity: Legal systems and processes may not always take into account the cultural practices and values of ethnic minorities, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.
4. Stereotyping and profiling: Ethnically diverse individuals may be subject to stereotypes and biases based on their race, ethnicity, or national origin, which can affect how they are perceived and treated within the legal system.
5. Discrimination and bias: Ethnic minorities may face discrimination and bias in various aspects of the legal system, including law enforcement, court proceedings, and access to legal resources.
6. Lack of understanding: Legal professionals may not fully understand the cultural practices and beliefs of ethnic minorities, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations that can affect the outcome of legal proceedings.
7. Limited access to legal aid: Ethnic minorities may have limited access to legal aid resources, including free or low-cost legal services, which can exacerbate existing disparities in the legal system.
8. Criminalization of cultural practices: Ethnic minorities may face criminal charges for cultural practices that are not illegal for the dominant culture, leading to a violation of their rights and freedoms.
9. Lack of representation in decision-making positions
