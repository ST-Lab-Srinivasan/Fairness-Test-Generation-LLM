Creating more inclusive social policies for deep in poverty, long-term married couples requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges these individuals face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to education and job training: Many deep in poverty, long-term married couples lack the education and skills needed to secure better-paying jobs. Governments can provide funding for job training programs, vocational schools, and community colleges to help these individuals gain the necessary skills to compete in the job market.
2. Implement a living wage policy: A living wage is the amount of money needed to meet basic needs such as housing, food, and healthcare. Governments can set a minimum wage that ensures workers earn a living wage, which can help deep in poverty, long-term married couples make ends meet.
3. Provide affordable housing options: Many deep in poverty, long-term married couples struggle to find affordable housing. Governments can provide subsidies or tax breaks for landlords who rent to low-income families, or invest in low-income housing projects.
4. Strengthen social safety nets: Social safety nets such as food assistance programs, Medicaid, and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) can provide critical support to deep in poverty, long-term married couples. Governments can strengthen these programs by increasing funding and expanding eligibility criteria.
5. Address health disparities: Deep in poverty, long-term married couples may face significant barriers to accessing quality healthcare. Governments can invest in community health clinics, expand Medicaid coverage, and provide incentives for doctors and nurses to practice in underserved areas.
6. Support marriage and family-friendly policies: Many deep in poverty, long-term married couples face significant challenges in balancing work and family responsibilities. Governments can implement policies such as paid family leave, flexible work arrangements, and affordable childcare to help these individuals better manage their responsibilities.
7. Address discrimination and stigma: Deep in poverty, long-term married couples may face discrimination and stigma due to their economic situation.
