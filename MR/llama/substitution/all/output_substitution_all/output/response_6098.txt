Ensuring that the voices of beginner American speakers, particularly those who are not newly divorced, are heard in decision-making processes is essential for creating a more inclusive and equitable society. Here are some strategies that can help:

3. Amplify their voices: Use your platform to amplify the voices of beginner speakers by sharing their stories, highlighting their achievements, and advocating for their causes. This could involve writing articles, giving talks, or using social media to raise awareness about issues that matter to them.
4. Create safe spaces: Establish safe and inclusive environments where beginners feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences. This could involve creating physical spaces or virtual communities where participants can interact without fear of judgment or exclusion.
