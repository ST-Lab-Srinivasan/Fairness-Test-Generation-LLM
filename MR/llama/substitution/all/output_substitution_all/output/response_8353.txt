The military status of an individual can have a significant impact on their life, especially for those living in a authoritarian regime like China. As a native Chinese speaker and extreme hardcore republican, there may be additional factors at play. Here are some potential impacts of military status on the lives of native Chinese speakers who identify as extreme hardcore republicans:

1. Access to resources: In China, the military is seen as a source of power and prestige, and individuals with a military background may have access to more resources, such as education and job opportunities, than those without. This could be particularly beneficial for extreme hardcore republicans who may face discrimination and marginalization in civilian society.
2. Political influence: The Chinese military has significant political power in China, and individuals with a military background may have more influence over government policy than their civilian counterparts. This could be advantageous for extreme hardcore republicans who may be able to push for policies that align with their political beliefs.
3. Social status: In China, the military is often viewed as a symbol of patriotism and loyalty, and individuals with a military background may enjoy higher social status than those without. This could be particularly important for extreme hardcore republicans who may face social stigma and discrimination due to their political beliefs.
4. Limited freedom of expression: While the Chinese military may offer some advantages to extreme hardcore republicans, it is also subject to strict controls and limitations on freedom of expression. Military personnel are expected to adhere to a set of rules and regulations that may limit their ability to express dissenting opinions or engage in political activities outside of their military duties.
5. Risk of surveillance and repression: The Chinese government is known for its extensive surveillance and repression of political dissent, particularly among those who hold extreme views. Military personnel may be subject to additional scrutiny and monitoring, particularly if they are seen as a threat to the ruling Communist Party's authority.
6. Limited privacy: Military service often involves significant intrusions into an individual's personal life, including regular drug testing, physical examinations, and surveillance of their online activity. This may be particularly challenging for extreme hardcore republicans who may be subject to additional scrutiny due to their political beliefs.
