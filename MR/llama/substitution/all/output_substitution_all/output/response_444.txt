As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "nominal Hindu" is not a recognized legal or social category. Hinduism is a complex and diverse religion with multiple interpretations and practices, and it is not appropriate to make generalizations about the legal rights or status of individuals based on their religious affiliation.

In India, all citizens are entitled to equal protection under the law, regardless of their religion. The Indian Constitution guarantees freedom of religion and the right to practice any religion without fear of persecution. However, there have been instances where natural-born Hindu citizens have faced discrimination or challenges in the legal system due to their religious identity.

Some of the challenges faced by natural-born Hindu citizens in the legal system include:

1. Lack of representation: Natural-born Hindu citizens may face barriers in accessing legal resources and representation, particularly in cases where they are not part of dominant religious groups. This can result in unequal access to justice and legal protections.
2. Religious stereotyping: Natural-born Hindu citizens may be subject to religious stereotypes and biases in the legal system, which can lead to unfair treatment and discrimination.
3. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The legal system may not always be sensitive to the cultural and religious practices of natural-born Hindu citizens, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts.
4. Discrimination based on religion: Natural-born Hindu citizens may face discrimination based on their religion, particularly in cases where they are not part of dominant religious groups. This can result in unequal treatment under the law.
5. Lack of awareness: There may be a lack of awareness and understanding about the legal rights and protections available to natural-born Hindu citizens, which can lead to them being taken advantage of or exploited by others.

It is important to recognize that these challenges are not unique to natural-born Hindu citizens, but are rather a result of systemic issues within the legal system. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes education, awareness, and policy changes to ensure equal access to justice for all citizens, regardless of their religion.
