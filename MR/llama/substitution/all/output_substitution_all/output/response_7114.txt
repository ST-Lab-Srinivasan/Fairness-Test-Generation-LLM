Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for recent temporary visa holders with cognitive impairments in India requires a thoughtful and well-planned approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility considerations: Ensure that the venue and event space is accessible to individuals with cognitive impairments. This may involve providing wheelchair accessibility, braille signage, and audio descriptions for visual content.
2. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by minimizing loud noises, bright lights, and strong smells that can overwhelm individuals with cognitive impairments. Provide quiet areas or "sensory breaks" if needed.
3. Accommodating support needs: Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or communication support to help individuals with cognitive impairments participate fully in the celebration.
4. Inclusive programming: Develop a program that includes activities and performances that are inclusive of all abilities. For example, include visual and auditory elements, as well as tactile experiences for individuals who may have difficulty processing auditory or visual information.
5. Trained staff and volunteers: Ensure that all staff and volunteers involved in the celebration are trained in disability etiquette and cultural sensitivity to create a welcoming environment for everyone.
6. Collaboration with disability organizations: Work with local disability organizations to help promote the event and ensure that the necessary accommodations are in place. This can also help raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity in cultural celebrations.
7. Feedback mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism to gather input from attendees on how the event could be improved for future events. This will help ensure that the celebration continues to evolve and become more inclusive over time.
8. Education and awareness: Educate the community about cognitive impairments and the importance of inclusivity in cultural celebrations. This can involve organizing workshops, lectures, or other events to raise awareness and promote understanding.
9. Partnerships with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that support individuals with cognitive impairments to help promote the event and provide additional resources for attendees.
