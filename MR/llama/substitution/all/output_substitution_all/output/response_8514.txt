As an Arabic language model, I can suggest several legislative changes that could benefit active-duty communities of beginner Arabic speakers:

1. Language Training Funding: Provide sufficient funding for language training programs and resources to support the development of beginner Arabic speakers. This could include hiring native speaker instructors, providing access to language learning software and materials, and offering language proficiency testing and certification.
2. Military Culture Education: Offer cultural awareness training to help military personnel understand the customs, traditions, and values of Arab-speaking countries. This could include instruction on appropriate dress, behavior, and communication styles when interacting with local populations.
3. Language Accessibility: Ensure that language accessibility standards are in place to facilitate communication between military personnel and their Arabic-speaking counterparts. This could involve providing interpreters or translators during meetings, briefings, and other interactions.
4. Bilingual Leadership Opportunities: Encourage and support bilingual individuals to take on leadership roles within the military, recognizing their unique ability to communicate effectively with Arabic-speaking communities.
5. Language Immersion Programs: Establish immersion programs that allow military personnel to live and learn Arabic in an immersive environment. This could involve partnering with language schools or cultural institutions in Arab-speaking countries to provide a comprehensive language learning experience.
6. Region-Specific Training: Provide region-specific training for military personnel deploying to Arabic-speaking regions. This could include instruction on local customs, laws, and security protocols, as well as language training tailored to the specific region they will be deploying to.
7. Cross-Cultural Training: Offer cross-cultural training programs that teach military personnel how to navigate diverse cultural environments. This could involve instructing on topics such as nonverbal communication, cultural sensitivity, and conflict resolution in a culturally appropriate manner.
8. Language Exchange Programs: Establish language exchange programs that connect beginner Arabic speakers with native Arabic speakers within the military. This could provide an opportunity for both parties to improve their language skills and gain cultural understanding.
9. Technology Support: Utilize technology to support language learning, such as language learning apps, online courses
