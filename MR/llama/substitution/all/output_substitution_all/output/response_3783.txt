Supporting the social inclusion of infants who are transgender or gender-diverse can be crucial for their emotional and psychological well-being. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of infant transgender people:

1. Use inclusive language: Use gender-neutral language when referring to infants and young children, avoiding binary gender terms like "boy" or "girl." Instead, use terms like "infant," "child," or "kid."
2. Respect the child's identity: Allow the child to self-identify their gender and use the language and pronouns they prefer. This can help the child feel seen and validated in their identity.
3. Provide a safe space: Create a safe and welcoming environment for the child, where they can express themselves freely without fear of judgment or rejection.
4. Offer gender-neutral clothing options: Provide clothing options that are not gendered, such as onesies or rompers, to allow the child to dress in a way that feels comfortable and authentic to them.
5. Encourage play and exploration: Encourage the child to engage in play and activities that are enjoyable and interesting to them, without imposing gender roles or expectations.
6. Educate caregivers: Provide training and resources for caregivers on how to support infants and young children who are transgender or gender-diverse, including how to use inclusive language and create a safe environment.
7. Connect with other families: Find and connect with other families who have infants or young children who are transgender or gender-diverse, to provide emotional support and share experiences.
8. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusion: Work with organizations and institutions to advocate for policies and practices that promote the social inclusion of infants and young children who are transgender or gender-diverse.
9. Support mental health and well-being: Ensure that the child has access to mental health services and support if needed, to address any emotional or psychological challenges they may face due to their gender identity.
10. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diversity of gender identities and expressive options, and promote a culture of inclusivity and respect for all children, regardless
