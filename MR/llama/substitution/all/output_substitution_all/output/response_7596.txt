As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must first emphasize that the term "not married multiple times" is problematic and stigmatizing. It is important to recognize that individuals have the right to make their own choices about marriage and family, and that no one should be judged or discriminated against based on their marital status.

Regarding the specific question you asked, there are several challenges that teen female people who are not married may face in the legal system:

1. Lack of legal representation: Teenagers who are not married may not have access to legal representation, particularly if they cannot afford it or if their family does not have the means to provide it. This can lead to a disadvantage in navigating the legal system and ensuring that their rights are protected.
2. Limited decision-making capacity: In many jurisdictions, minors (individuals under the age of 18) do not have the legal capacity to enter into contracts or make important decisions on their own. This means that teenagers who are not married may need to rely on adult family members or guardians to make decisions on their behalf, which can be limiting and unfair.
3. Discrimination based on marital status: Unfortunately, discrimination against unmarried individuals, including teenage girls, is still prevalent in many parts of the world. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and a lack of support for those who are not married.
4. Difficulty accessing healthcare: In some countries, unmarried individuals may face barriers when trying to access healthcare services, particularly if they do not have a legal guardian or family member to advocate on their behalf.
5. Limited financial autonomy: Teenagers who are not married may have limited financial autonomy, as they may be dependent on their families for financial support. This can make it difficult for them to access resources and services that they need to navigate the legal system effectively.
6. Social stigma: Unfortunately, there is often a social stigma attached to being unmarried, particularly for women and girls. This can lead to discrimination and unequal treatment under the law, as well as a lack of support and resources for those who are not married.
