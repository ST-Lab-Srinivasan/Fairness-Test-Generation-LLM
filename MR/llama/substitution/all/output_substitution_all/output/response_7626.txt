As a native Chinese speaker who is also a natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system:

1. Language barriers: Depending on where you live and the level of proficiency in English, you may encounter language barriers when interacting with law enforcement, court officials, or legal professionals. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, or a lack of access to critical information.
