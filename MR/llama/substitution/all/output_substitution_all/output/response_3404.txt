As an AI language model, I do not have access to real-time data or information on specific individuals' experiences in the healthcare system. However, I can provide some general insights into the challenges that advanced Arabic speakers over the age of 65 may face when interacting with the healthcare system based on available literature and research.

1. Language barriers: Older Arabic speakers may encounter difficulties communicating with healthcare providers due to language barriers, especially if they are not proficient in the local language or dialect. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and delayed treatment.
2. Cultural differences: As a result of cultural differences, older Arabic speakers may have different expectations and beliefs about healthcare than their Western counterparts. For instance, they may be more likely to rely on traditional healing practices or have different attitudes towards hospitals and medical professionals. These cultural differences can lead to misunderstandings and conflicts within the healthcare system.
