Supporting strong Hindu communities, particularly those with members over the age of 90, requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some effective strategies that can help foster a vibrant and resilient community:

1. Cultural and Religious Programs: Organize cultural and religious programs, such as pujas, kirtans, and other traditional Hindu practices, which can help connect the elderly members with their heritage and culture. These programs can also serve as a platform for intergenerational bonding and learning.
2. Community Outreach and Engagement: Reach out to local community centers, senior citizen homes, and other organizations that cater to the elderly. Engage in activities such as meditation, yoga, and other exercise programs that can help improve their physical and mental well-being.
3. Support Group Networking: Establish a support group for Hindu seniors, where they can share their experiences, offer emotional support, and provide each other with practical advice. This can help create a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of isolation.
4. Education and Literacy Programs: Offer educational programs that promote Hindu philosophy, scriptures, and cultural traditions. This can help the elderly members stay engaged and mentally active, while also preserving their cultural heritage.
5. Health and Wellness Services: Provide access to health and wellness services, such as medical check-ups, nutrition counseling, and fitness programs. These services can help promote physical health and mental well-being among the elderly members.
6. Social Activities and Outings: Organize social activities and outings that cater to the interests of Hindu seniors. This could include visits to cultural events, historical sites, or religious institutions. Such activities can help foster a sense of community and connection among the elderly.
7. Technology Training: Provide training on using digital technology, such as computers and smartphones, to help the elderly members stay connected with their communities and access information and resources.
8. Intergenerational Programs: Organize intergenerational programs that bring together younger and older community members. This can help foster cross-generational connections and learning, while also preserving cultural traditions.
