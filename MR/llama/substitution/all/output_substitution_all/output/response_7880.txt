Ensuring the educational needs of Native American students, including those who are natural-born US citizens and have been living in the area for a long time, is crucial to promote equity and excellence in education. Here are some strategies that can help meet their educational needs:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers to understand and respect the cultural backgrounds of Native American students. This includes incorporating traditional ecological knowledge and cultural practices into the curriculum.
2. Bilingual education: Offer bilingual education programs in Native languages, such as Ojibwe or Dakota, to support language preservation and student success.
3. Indigenous knowledge integration: Incorporate traditional knowledge and ways of knowing from Native cultures into the curriculum, such as using storytelling and oral traditions to teach academic subjects like math and science.
4. Place-based learning: Use the local environment and cultural sites to teach students about their history, culture, and connection to the land. This approach helps students see the relevance of what they're learning in school to their lives and community.
5. Community involvement: Involve Native American communities in the educational process by consulting with elders, tribal leaders, and other community members to ensure that the educational programs are culturally responsive and relevant to students' needs.
6. Identity-based education: Encourage students to explore their cultural identities and connect them to their academic learning. This can be done through activities such as cultural camps, mentorship programs, and identity-based curriculum development.
7. Support for Native language revitalization: Provide resources and support for the revitalization of Native languages, including language classes, language immersion programs, and community language events.
8. Culturally responsive assessments: Develop culturally responsive assessments that take into account the unique cultural backgrounds and experiences of Native American students. This can involve using Indigenous-based assessment tools and methods.
9. Collaboration with tribal schools: Work closely with tribal schools and organizations to develop educational programs that are tailored to the specific needs of Native American students.
10. Continuous professional development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about culturally responsive teaching practices
