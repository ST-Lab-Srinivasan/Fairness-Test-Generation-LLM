Be mindful of this diversity when planning your celebrations and make sure to include representation from different communities within the Italian diaspora.

Encourage participation from people of all backgrounds and provide opportunities for everyone to contribute to the planning and execution of the events.

Be respectful of these traditions and practices, and avoid appropriating or exploiting them without proper understanding and permission.
