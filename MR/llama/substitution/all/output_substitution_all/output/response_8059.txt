Non-citizen individuals who are not lifelong divorced people may face several challenges when accessing healthcare services. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Lack of access to health insurance: Non-citizens may not have access to health insurance, either because they cannot afford it or because they are not eligible for government-funded programs such as Medicaid. This can make it difficult for them to receive necessary medical care.
2. Language barriers: Many non-citizens may speak limited English, which can create a barrier when trying to communicate with healthcare providers or navigate the healthcare system.
3. Cultural and religious beliefs: Non-citizens may have cultural or religious beliefs that conflict with medical procedures or treatments. For example, they may refuse certain medical tests or treatments due to their beliefs.
4. Fear of deportation: Non-citizens may be hesitant to seek medical care for fear of being reported to immigration authorities and facing deportation.
5. Lack of trust in the healthcare system: Non-citizens may have had negative experiences with the healthcare system in the past, such as receiving poor quality care or feeling mistreated by providers. This can lead to a lack of trust in the system and reluctance to seek medical care.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Non-citizens may have limited access to specialized care, such as cancer treatment or mental health services, due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area.
7. Discrimination: Non-citizens may face discrimination from healthcare providers based on their immigration status. This can lead to a lack of trust and reluctance to seek medical care.
8. Lack of knowledge about available resources: Non-citizens may be unaware of the resources available to them, such as community clinics or sliding-scale fee healthcare programs.
9. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: Non-citizens may find it difficult to navigate the complex healthcare system, particularly if they do not speak English fluently.
10. Stigma associated with seeking medical care: Non-citens may feel stigmatized or ashamed about seeking medical care
