Not being an upper middle-income refugee, I cannot claim to have firsthand knowledge of the challenges faced by this group. However, based on research and anecdotal evidence, here are some potential challenges that recent temporary visa holders to the US may face in accessing healthcare:

1. Lack of health insurance: Many recent refugees may not have access to health insurance, particularly if they do not qualify for Medicaid or other government-funded health programs. This can make it difficult for them to afford medical care, including preventive services and emergency treatments.
2. Language barriers: Refugees may face language barriers that can hinder their ability to communicate effectively with healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or delays in diagnosis and treatment.
3. Cultural differences: Refugees may have different cultural beliefs and practices surrounding health and illness, which can impact their adherence to medical advice or treatment plans. For example, they may be hesitant to seek medical care for certain conditions due to cultural or religious beliefs.
4. Limited access to specialized care: Refugees may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as mental health services or complex surgeries, due to geographic barriers or lack of knowledge about available resources.
5. Trauma and stress: Many refugees have experienced trauma and stress in their home countries or during their migration journey, which can impact their mental and physical health. They may need access to mental health services, but may face barriers such as stigma or lack of cultural competency among providers.
6. Documentation challenges: Refugees may face difficulties obtaining or replacing important medical documents, such as immunization records or prescriptions, due to language barriers or issues with document authenticity.
7. Financial constraints: Refugees may have limited financial resources, which can make it difficult for them to access healthcare services or pay for medications and treatments.
8. Limited awareness of available resources: Refugees may be unaware of the availability of healthcare resources in their area, such as community clinics or sliding-scale fees for medical care.
9. Discrimination and stigma: Refugees may face discrimination and stigma from healthcare
