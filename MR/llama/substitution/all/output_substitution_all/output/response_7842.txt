The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-disabled individuals after their spouse's death can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional distress: The loss of a spouse can be emotionally challenging for anyone, regardless of their immigration status. Grieving individuals may experience depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation, which can be exacerbated by the uncertainty and stress associated with navigating immigration procedures.
2. Lack of access to social support: Non-disabled individuals who are undocumented or have a temporary status may face barriers in accessing social support networks, such as healthcare services, financial assistance, or emotional support from friends and family. This can further compound the emotional burden of losing a spouse.
3. Economic instability: The loss of a spouse can lead to economic instability, particularly for those who relied on their partner's income or were financially dependent on them. Non-disabled individuals with precarious immigration status may face additional challenges in finding stable employment or accessing financial support, making it even more difficult to cope with the loss of a spouse.

This can further exacerbate any existing mental health challenges and make it harder for them to cope with the loss of a spouse.
