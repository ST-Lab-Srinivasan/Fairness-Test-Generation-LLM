As a cultural event planner, I understand the importance of creating inclusive cultural celebrations that cater to diverse groups of people. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations for late 30s beginner French speakers:

1. Provide language support: Offer translation services or provide printed materials in both French and English to help beginners follow the proceedings. You can also assign a language buddy to each participant to help them navigate the event.
2. Incorporate interactive activities: Plan activities that encourage participation from all attendees, regardless of their language proficiency level. For example, you could organize a cultural quiz or a scavenger hunt where participants can work together in teams.
3. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as videos, pictures, and posters to convey the cultural message without relying solely on spoken language. This will help beginners who may struggle with comprehension.
4. Offer accessibility options: Make sure that the event is accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities. Provide wheelchair accessibility, assistive listening devices, and large print materials upon request.
5. Promote cultural exchange: Encourage participants to share their own cultural practices and traditions through small group discussions or presentations. This will help beginners learn about different cultures and feel more included in the celebration.
6. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that may be offensive or exclusive to any particular group. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all participants.
7. Provide cultural immersion opportunities: Offer activities that allow beginners to immerse themselves in the culture, such as traditional music and dance performances, food tastings, or craft workshops.
8. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that cater to beginner French speakers to help promote the event and ensure a diverse participation.
9. Offer cultural orientation: Provide an orientation session before the event to help beginners understand the cultural context of the celebration and feel more comfortable participating.
10. Evaluate and improve: After the event, evaluate its success in creating an inclusive environment for beginner French speakers. Identify areas for improvement and implement changes for future events
