The benefits of having diverse perspectives in leadership roles, particularly from individuals who are over the age of 85 and part of a minority group such as the Jewish community, can be numerous and far-reaching. Here are some potential advantages:

1. Unique Insights: Older adults, especially those from underrepresented groups, bring a wealth of life experience and historical context to the table. Their perspectives can offer fresh insights and innovative approaches to problem-solving, as they have lived through different times and circumstances than their younger counterparts.
2. Emotional Intelligence: Older adults tend to have higher emotional intelligence due to years of experience navigating complex social situations. This emotional intelligence can help them navigate conflicts and make more informed decisions in leadership roles.
3. Resilience and Adaptability: Those who have lived through challenging times, such as the Holocaust survivors, have developed resilience and adaptability skills that are essential for leadership. They know how to persevere and thrive under difficult circumstances.
4. Intergenerational Learning: The involvement of older adults in leadership positions can provide an opportunity for intergenerational learning and knowledge sharing. Younger generations can learn from the experiences and wisdom of their elders, while older adults can gain a deeper understanding of contemporary issues and challenges.
5. Diversity and Inclusion: Having diverse perspectives in leadership roles can foster a more inclusive and diverse workplace culture. Older adults, particularly those from underrepresented groups, can contribute to the creation of a more equitable and inclusive environment for everyone.
6. Role Model Effect: The involvement of older adults in leadership positions can serve as a role model for younger generations, inspiring them to pursue leadership roles and make a positive impact in their communities.
7. Community Engagement: Older adults often remain actively involved in their communities, bringing their skills and experience to bear on local issues and causes. By involving them in leadership roles, you can leverage their community connections and networks for the greater good.
8. Historical Context: Older adults have a unique historical context that can inform decision-making and problem-solving. Their knowledge of the past can provide valuable insights into current challenges and opportunities
