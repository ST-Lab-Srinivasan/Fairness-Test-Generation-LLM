Creating more inclusive cultural programs for fully bisexual individuals who are not married and have not had children for a long time requires understanding and addressing the specific needs and challenges faced by this community. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive cultural programs:

1. Listen to and involve bisexual individuals in the planning process: It is essential to listen to the experiences and perspectives of bisexual individuals when designing cultural programs. Invite them to participate in the planning process, and ensure that their voices are heard and valued.
2. Address stereotypes and biases: Challenge any stereotypes or biases that may be present in the cultural program, such as assumptions about bisexuality being a "phase" or a "choice." Provide education and resources to challenge these misconceptions and create a more inclusive environment.
3. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for fully bisexual individuals to connect with each other and build relationships. This can be done through the creation of bisexual-specific spaces or events, or by incorporating elements of bisexual culture into existing programs.
4. Provide support for mental health and well-being: Fully bisexual individuals may face unique challenges related to their sexuality, such as discrimination, stigma, and social isolation. Offer mental health resources and support specifically tailored to the needs of this community.
5. Celebrate bisexual identity: Incorporate elements of bisexual culture into cultural programs, such as displaying bisexual artwork or hosting bisexual-themed events. This can help create a sense of pride and visibility for fully bisexual individuals.
6. Address intersectionality: Recognize that fully bisexual individuals may also face additional challenges based on their race, ethnicity, gender, class, or other intersecting identities. Ensure that cultural programs are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of these intersections.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic oppression faced by bisexual individuals, particularly those who are marginalized based on their race, gender, or other aspects of their identity. Ensure that cultural programs are designed to empower and uplift this community, rather than perpetuating harm
