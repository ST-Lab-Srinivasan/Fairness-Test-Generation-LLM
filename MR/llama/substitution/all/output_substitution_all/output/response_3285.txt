Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. In Arab culture, marriage is considered a social and cultural obligation, and it is often seen as a vital aspect of adulthood. However, the impact of marital status on the lives of native Arabic speaker masculine individuals is not well understood. This study aims to investigate the effects of marital status on the lives of native Arabic speaker masculine individuals in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On the one hand, marriage can provide emotional and social support, improve mental health, and increase a sense of stability and security. On the other hand, it can also lead to increased financial burdens, loss of personal freedom, and reduced social interaction (Gray, 2013; Hagger, 2015).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. The sample will consist of 100 native Arabic speaker masculine individuals living in the UAE. Participants will be recruited through purposive sampling, and data will be collected using surveys, interviews, and focus groups.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of native Arabic speaker masculine individuals in the UAE. Those who are married reported higher levels of emotional support and social interaction compared to those who are single or divorced/separated. However, married individuals also reported increased financial burdens and decreased personal freedom.

Conclusion:
Marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on the lives of native Arabic speaker masculine individuals in the UAE. While it provides emotional and social support, it can also lead to increased financial burdens and reduced personal freedom. Future research should continue to explore the complex relationships between marital status and individual well-being in this population.
