Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-relationship active-duty individuals requires understanding and catering to their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Include a wide range of activities: Offer a variety of activities that appeal to different interests and preferences, such as musical performances, art exhibitions, dance classes, or food festivals. This will help ensure that there is something for everyone to enjoy.
2. Provide childcare options: Many non-relationship active-duty individuals have children, and finding quality childcare can be challenging. Offering on-site childcare services or providing referrals to local providers can make it easier for them to participate in cultural events.
3. Create a safe space: Non-relationship active-duty individuals may feel uncomfortable attending cultural events due to social stigmas or feelings of isolation. Creating a safe and welcoming environment by providing a quiet area for napping, relaxation, or meditation can help them feel more at ease.
4. Offer flexible attendance options: Many non-relationship active-duty individuals have busy schedules and may find it difficult to attend cultural events during traditional hours. Consider offering events in the evening or on weekends, or providing virtual attendance options for those who cannot physically attend.
5. Involve them in the planning process: Encourage non-relationship active-duty individuals to participate in the planning and organization of cultural events. This can help them feel more invested in the event and more likely to attend.
6. Provide accessible venues: Ensure that the venue is accessible for individuals with disabilities or mobility issues. This can include providing wheelchair accessibility, audio descriptions, or braille signage.
7. Offer affordable tickets: Many non-relationship active-duty individuals may have limited budgets due to financial constraints. Consider offering discounted tickets or scholarships for military personnel and their families.
8. Promote cultural exchange: Encourage non-relationship active-duty individuals to share their culture and traditions with others through cultural exchange events. This can help break down social barriers and create a more inclusive environment.
