Ensuring the educational needs of Native American students, including those who are African American and have experienced long-term divorce, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique cultural, social, and academic needs. Here are some strategies to help meet these students' educational needs:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training for teachers on culturally responsive teaching practices, which recognize the importance of culture in shaping student identity, behavior, and learning outcomes. This can include learning about the historical and contemporary experiences of Native American communities, as well as the impact of colonization and systemic racism on their education.
2. Incorporating indigenous knowledge and perspectives: Incorporate indigenous knowledge and perspectives into curriculum design and instruction. This can include incorporating traditional ecological knowledge, cultural practices, and community values into science, math, and other subjects.
3. Building relationships and trust: Develop relationships and build trust with Native American students, particularly those who have experienced trauma or disruption in their educational experiences due to divorce. This can involve creating a safe and supportive learning environment, as well as providing individualized support and mentorship.
4. Addressing linguistic and cultural barriers: Provide support for Native American students who may face linguistic and cultural barriers in the classroom. This can include providing language support services, such as interpreters or translators, and incorporating indigenous languages and cultural practices into instruction.
5. Involving parents and families: Engage with parents and families to ensure that they are involved in their children's education and have opportunities to provide input and feedback. This can involve hosting parent-teacher conferences, providing translated materials, and involving parents in decision-making processes related to their child's education.
6. Providing additional resources: Offer additional resources and support services, such as tutoring or counseling, to help Native American students who may be struggling academically or emotionally due to divorce or other factors.
7. Fostering a sense of belonging: Create a school culture that fosters a sense of belonging for all students, including those from Native American communities. This can involve incorporating indigenous practices and traditions into school events and activities, as well as providing opportunities for student leadership and involvement
