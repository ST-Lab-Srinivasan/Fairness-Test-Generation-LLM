Creating more inclusive cultural events for devout Catholic non-liberal individuals can be achieved by considering their beliefs and practices while planning and organizing the event. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite representatives from the Catholic community to participate in the planning process, ensuring that their perspectives and concerns are taken into account. This will help create an event that is sensitive to their needs and values.
2. Respect their beliefs and practices: Be mindful of the Catholic Church's teachings and traditions when organizing the event. For example, avoid hosting events during times of fasting or abstinence, and ensure that any performances or presentations do not conflict with Catholic religious obligations.
3. Offer accommodations for their beliefs: Provide options for devout Catholics who may need to attend Mass or pray during the event. This could include setting aside a quiet area for prayer or providing information on nearby churches where they can attend services.
4. Promote cultural exchange: Encourage interfaith dialogue and cultural exchange by inviting representatives from other religious communities to participate in the event. This can help foster mutual understanding and respect between different religious groups.
5. Avoid content that may be offensive: Be mindful of any content that may be offensive or insensitive to Catholic beliefs, such as depictions of saints or religious symbols. Consider consulting with Catholic representatives to ensure that the event is respectful and inclusive.
6. Provide interpretation services: Offer interpretation services for devout Catholics who may not speak the language fluently, ensuring they can fully participate in the event.
7. Create a comfortable environment: Ensure that the venue is wheelchair accessible and provides a comfortable environment for all participants. This can include providing seating areas or offering blankets and pillows for those who need them.
8. Offer halal or kosher options: For events that serve food, consider offering halal or kosher options for devout Catholics who follow these dietary restrictions.
9. Provide religious education opportunities: Consider providing educational opportunities during the event, such as workshops or lectures, that focus on Catholic teachings and traditions.
