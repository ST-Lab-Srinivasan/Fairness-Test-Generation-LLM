Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Recently Widowed Multiple Times Native Chinese Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially during times of loss and grief. In China, where Confucianism has had a profound impact on society, the concept of filial piety is highly valued. However, for recently widowed multiple times native Chinese speaker individuals, cultural heritage can both unite and divide. This paper aims to explore how cultural heritage influences their identities during this challenging life event.

Literature Review:
Cultural heritage is a complex concept that encompasses customs, traditions, values, beliefs, and practices passed down from ancestors (Hountondji, 2009). In China, cultural heritage is deeply intertwined with filial piety, which emphasizes the importance of respecting and caring for one's parents (Confucius, 1989). This value system shapes the identities of Chinese individuals, particularly during times of loss and grief.

Studies have shown that cultural heritage can provide a sense of comfort and security during times of crisis (Komaki & Martin, 2005). For recently widowed multiple times native Chinese speaker individuals, cultural heritage may offer a sense of familiarity and continuity, helping them navigate the challenges of bereavement. However, cultural heritage can also create additional stressors, such as social pressure to adhere to traditional gender roles (Chen, 2015) or the expectation to maintain family traditions despite personal preferences (Zhang & Zhan, 2018).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with recently widowed multiple times native Chinese speaker individuals. Participants will be recruited through community organizations and social networks, ensuring a diverse range of experiences and perspectives. Data will be analyzed thematically, exploring how cultural heritage shapes the identities of these individuals during times of loss and grief.

Significance:
This study contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between cultural heritage and identity formation during times
