As a cultural and linguistic AI model, I can provide some insights on the challenges faced by native Arabic speakers who are recently single and looking for jobs. However, it's important to note that these challenges may vary depending on individual circumstances and locations. Here are some common challenges that these individuals might face:

1. Language barrier: Depending on where they live and work, native Arabic speakers may encounter language barriers in the job market. Many jobs require proficiency in multiple languages, and if their native language is Arabic, they may struggle to communicate effectively in other languages.
