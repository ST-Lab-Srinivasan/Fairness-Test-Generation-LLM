Creating more inclusive cultural events for recently arrived temporary visa holders who identify as soft liberals can be achieved by taking into consideration their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their backgrounds: Take the time to research and understand the cultures, values, and beliefs of the individuals you are trying to include. This will help you tailor your events to their interests and needs.
2. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services during events to ensure that everyone can participate and understand what is happening.
3. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure your events are physically accessible and have a welcoming atmosphere for all attendees. This can be achieved by providing comfortable seating, adequate lighting, and clear signage.
4. Offer cultural activities: Incorporate cultural activities that cater to the interests of temporary visa holders, such as traditional music, dance, or art. This will allow them to connect with their peers and feel included in the event.
5. Foster a sense of community: Encourage attendees to mingle and get to know one another by creating opportunities for networking and socializing. You can do this by hosting social events outside of the cultural events, such as potlucks or game nights.
6. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the potential power imbalances that may exist between temporary visa holders and local individuals. Take steps to address these imbalances by creating spaces for marginalized voices to be heard and valued.
7. Involve them in the planning process: Involve temporary visa holders in the planning and decision-making process of cultural events. This will give them a sense of ownership and agency, and ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into consideration.
8. Provide educational opportunities: Offer workshops or lectures that provide information about local culture, customs, and history. This can help temporary visa holders better understand the context of the events they are participating in.
9. Create intercultural dialogue: Facilitate discussions between temporary visa holders and local individuals to promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange. This can be done through structured activities or informal conversations.
