Creating more inclusive cultural events for Documented Individuals (DI) within the context of Orthodox Christianity can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve DI representatives in event planning: Invite representatives from different DI communities to participate in the planning process, providing them with a platform to share their ideas and perspectives.
