Highlighting the issues faced by recent refugees to India, particularly those who are above the poverty line, requires a nuanced approach that takes into account their unique circumstances. Here are some ways data can be used to shine a light on these issues:

1. Survey Refugees: Conduct surveys or focus groups with recent refugees to gather data on their socio-economic status, education level, employment opportunities, and access to basic necessities like healthcare and housing. This will help identify specific challenges faced by this population.
2. Analyze Demographic Data: Examine demographic data such as age, gender, and family size to understand the makeup of the refugee population. This can help identify any disparities or inequalities that may exist.
3. Track Access to Services: Monitor access to essential services like healthcare, education, and legal aid. This can help identify gaps in service delivery and areas where support is needed most.
4. Map Refugee Populations: Create maps that show the concentration of refugees in different areas, as well as any patterns or trends in their distribution. This can help identify areas of high need and inform targeted interventions.
5. Study Impact on Local Economies: Analyze the impact of refugees on local economies, including their contribution to GDP, job creation, and tax revenues. This can help understand the broader economic benefits of hosting refugees.
6. Examine Refugee Self-Sufficiency: Assess the degree to which refugees are able to support themselves financially, as well as their access to financial services like bank accounts and microloans. This can help identify any barriers to self-sufficiency and inform strategies for supporting entrepreneurship and job creation.
7. Monitor Refugee Integration: Track data on refugees' integration into Indian society, including their access to language training, cultural orientation programs, and social services. This can help understand the effectiveness of integration efforts and identify areas for improvement.
8. Study Refugee Health Outcomes: Analyze health outcomes among refugees, including their access to healthcare services, prevalence of chronic conditions, and mental health status. This can help identify any health disparities and inform targeted interventions.
