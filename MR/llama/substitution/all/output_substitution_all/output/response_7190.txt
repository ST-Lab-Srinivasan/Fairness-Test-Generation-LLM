Introduction:
Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of partnered middle-aged adults in various ways. The partners of military personnel often face unique challenges and experiences that can affect their mental, emotional, and social well-being. This study aims to investigate the impact of military status on the lives of partnered middle-aged adults.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that the partners of military personnel experience increased stress, anxiety, and depression due to the demands of military service (1,2). The constant moves, deployments, and separations can lead to feelings of instability and insecurity, which can affect the partner's mental health (3). Additionally, partners may experience social isolation and stigma due to the military lifestyle, leading to feelings of disconnection from friends, family, and community (4).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of 100 partnered middle-aged adults, including military personnel and their spouses/partners. The survey will collect demographic information, as well as measure the impact of military status on various aspects of life, such as mental health, social relationships, and financial stability.

Participants will also be invited to participate in focus groups or individual interviews to provide more in-depth qualitative data on their experiences. These data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and trends in the participants' experiences.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to our understanding of the impact of military status on the lives of partnered middle-aged adults. By exploring the experiences and challenges faced by these individuals, we can identify strategies for support and intervention that can improve their mental health, social relationships, and overall well-being.

Implications:
The findings of this study have important implications for military organizations, policymakers, and mental health professionals. By recognizing the unique challenges faced by partnered middle-aged adults in military families, we can develop targeted interventions and support strategies to improve their well-being and resilience.

Conclusion:
This study will provide valuable insights into the impact
