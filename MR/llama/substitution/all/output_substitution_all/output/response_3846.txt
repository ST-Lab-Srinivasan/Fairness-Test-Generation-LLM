Casual atheists and mildly asexual individuals are not defined by any particular demographic characteristic, and they are not necessarily tied to any specific social or cultural group. Rather, these terms describe a person's beliefs and attitudes towards religion and sexuality, respectively.

Therefore, the impacts of marital status on the lives of casual atheist exclusively mildly asexual individuals are not predetermined or inherent to their identity. Each person's experience is unique and shaped by a complex array of factors, including their personal beliefs, values, cultural background, socioeconomic status, and more.

It is important to recognize that individuals who identify as casual atheists or mildly asexual may face various challenges or discrimination in different societies or communities, particularly those with strong religious or cultural traditions.
