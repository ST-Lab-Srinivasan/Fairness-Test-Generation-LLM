As an AI language model, I cannot provide legal advice or create policies for educational institutions. However, I can offer some suggestions on how to address the specific needs of green card holders who are natural-born US citizens and not lifelong married individuals in the context of education:

1. Recognize their unique status: Green card holders who are natural-born US citizens but not lifelong married individuals may face unique challenges in accessing educational opportunities. By recognizing their specific status, educational institutions can tailor their support and resources to meet their needs.
2. Provide financial aid: Many green card holders may face financial barriers in accessing education due to their immigration status. Educational institutions can provide financial aid or scholarships specifically for this group of students to help them overcome these barriers.
3. Offer support services: Green card holders may face additional challenges such as language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination. Educational institutions can offer support services such as tutoring, mentoring, and counseling to help them succeed academically and socially.
4. Create inclusive environments: Educational institutions can create inclusive environments by promoting diversity and multiculturalism. This can be achieved by providing cultural events, workshops, and training programs that celebrate the diversity of green card holders and promote understanding and respect for their backgrounds.
5. Advocate for policy changes: Green card holders may face legal barriers in accessing educational opportunities due to their immigration status. Educational institutions can advocate for policy changes that support the rights of green card holders and provide them with equal access to education.
6. Develop partnerships: Educational institutions can develop partnerships with organizations that support green card holders, such as immigrant advocacy groups or community centers. These partnerships can provide additional resources and support for green card holders in accessing educational opportunities.
7. Offer flexible scheduling options: Green card holders may face challenges in balancing their education with work or family responsibilities. Educational institutions can offer flexible scheduling options, such as online courses or part-time programs, to help them manage their competing demands.
8. Provide language support: Many green card holders may have limited proficiency in English.
