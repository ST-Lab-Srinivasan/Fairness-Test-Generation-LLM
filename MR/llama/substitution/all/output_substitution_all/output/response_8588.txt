As a native English speaker and recent green card holder to the US, there are several challenges you may face within the legal system. Here are some potential issues to consider:

1. Language Barriers: Depending on where you live in the US, you may encounter language barriers that can make it difficult to navigate the legal system. If you don't speak fluent English, you may have difficulty understanding court procedures, interpreting legal documents, and communicating with lawyers and other legal professionals.
2. Cultural Differences: As a non-US citizen, you may experience cultural differences that can impact your interactions with the legal system. For example, you may be unfamiliar with US legal traditions and customs, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
3. Lack of Legal Knowledge: As a recent green card holder, you may not have a comprehensive understanding of US laws and regulations. This lack of knowledge can make it difficult to navigate the legal system, especially when dealing with complex legal issues.
4. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Depending on your location, you may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal clinics, and other support services. This can make it more challenging to navigate the legal system and address any legal issues that arise.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, non-US citizens may face discrimination within the legal system. You may encounter biases or prejudices from legal professionals, which can affect your ability to access justice.
6. Difficulty Proving Citizenship: As a green card holder, you may face challenges when trying to prove your citizenship status within the legal system. This can be particularly problematic if you encounter issues related to your immigration status.
7. Limited Legal Protections: As a non-US citizen, you may have limited legal protections and rights within the US. This can make it more difficult to navigate the legal system and access justice when needed.
8. Difficulty Navigating Court Procedures: The US court system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. You may have difficulty navigating court procedures, such as filing documents, attending hearings, and communicating with court officials.
9. Limited Access to Legal Aid
