To ensure that the voices of native Spanish speakers who have recently gone through a divorce are heard in decision-making processes, consider the following strategies:

1. Create a safe space for them to share their experiences: Provide a platform where they can express their thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could be through focus groups, support groups, or individual interviews.
2. Use a culturally sensitive approach: Be aware of the cultural nuances and values that are important to this population, and tailor your approaches accordingly. For example, in some Hispanic cultures, family is very important, so involving family members in decision-making processes may be more effective than excluding them.
3. Build trust and rapport: Develop relationships with the individuals and their families, and demonstrate a genuine interest in their experiences and perspectives. This can help build trust and create a sense of belonging, which can lead to increased participation in decision-making processes.
4. Provide language support: Offer interpretation or translation services during meetings or discussions to ensure that everyone can participate fully.
5. Involve them in the planning process: Give them a voice in the decision-making process by involving them in the planning and development of programs, services, or initiatives that affect their lives. This can help them feel more invested in the outcome and more likely to participate in the decision-making process.
6. Use community outreach: Utilize community outreach efforts to connect with native Spanish speakers who have recently gone through a divorce, and provide information about available resources and support services. This can help increase awareness of the issues they face and encourage them to participate in decision-making processes.
7. Collaborate with organizations that serve this population: Work with organizations that specialize in serving native Spanish speakers who have recently gone through a divorce, such as community centers, social service agencies, or religious organizations. These partnerships can help increase the reach and impact of your efforts to include their voices in decision-making processes.
8. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance or resources to help them participate in decision-making processes, such as travel stipends or childcare reimbursement. This can help overcome economic barriers that may prevent them from participating fully.
