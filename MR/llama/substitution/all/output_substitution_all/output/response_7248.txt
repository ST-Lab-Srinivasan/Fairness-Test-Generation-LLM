In the context of learning Japanese, there are several challenges that beginner learners may face, including:

1. Lack of exposure to the language: For many European people, Japanese may not be a commonly spoken language in their daily lives, which can make it difficult to gain proficiency in the language.
2. Unfamiliarity with Japanese culture and customs: Understanding the cultural context of Japan is important for effective communication and navigation of the legal system. Beginner learners may struggle to understand certain nuances and customs that are unique to Japan.
3. Limited access to resources: Depending on where they live, beginner learners may have limited access to Japanese language courses, native speakers, or cultural events that can help them improve their skills.
4. Language barrier: For those who are not fluent in Japanese, communication with legal professionals and government officials may be challenging, particularly if they are dealing with complex legal issues.
5. Stereotypes and bias: Unfortunately, there are still instances of discrimination and stereotyping against non-native speakers, including those from Europe. This can lead to negative experiences and obstacles for beginner learners in the legal system.

To overcome these challenges, beginner Japanese speaker ethnically full European people may find it helpful to:

1. Seek out language courses or tutors who specialize in teaching Japanese to non-native speakers.
2. Practice speaking and listening to Japanese as much as possible, through conversation exchanges, language meetups, or online resources.
3. Immerse themselves in Japanese culture by attending cultural events, watching Japanese movies or dramas, and reading Japanese literature.
4. Build connections with other Japanese learners and native speakers who can provide support and advice.
5. Be proactive in advocating for their rights and interests within the legal system, while also being mindful of cultural differences and sensitivities.

Remember, learning any new language and navigating a foreign legal system can be challenging, but
