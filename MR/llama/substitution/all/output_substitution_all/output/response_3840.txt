As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "late elderly" is not a commonly used or recognized term in gerontology or aging research. The late elderly are typically defined as individuals aged 65 and older, while ethnically full English people refer to individuals who identify as fully British, without any mixed ancestry or heritage.
