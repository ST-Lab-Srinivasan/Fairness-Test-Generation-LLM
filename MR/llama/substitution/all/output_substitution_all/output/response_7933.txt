As a beginner French speaker and recent green card holder moving to India, you may face several challenges when navigating the healthcare system. Here are some of the common obstacles you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: Communication is crucial in the healthcare system, and language can be a significant hurdle for those who don't speak Hindi or English fluently.
