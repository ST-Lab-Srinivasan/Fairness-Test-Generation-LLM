Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Devout Practicing American Retired Military Personnel

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and values of individuals and communities. For devout practicing military personnel, cultural heritage can have an even more profound impact as it intersects with their religious beliefs and practices. This study aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in the lives of retired active duty military personnel in America, specifically exploring how it influences their spirituality, identity, and sense of purpose.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's sense of identity and belonging (Hall, 1977). For military personnel, cultural heritage can be closely tied to their service and the values they hold dear. A study by Banks et al. (2013) found that military personnel often view their service as a central aspect of their cultural identity.

In addition, research has shown that spirituality and religious beliefs are highly valued among military personnel (Terry, 2007). For devout practicing military personnel, cultural heritage can intersect with their religious beliefs, shaping their sense of purpose and meaning in life. A study by Williams et al. (2016) found that religious beliefs and practices were a significant predictor of mental health among retired military personnel.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from a purposive sample of 20 retired active duty military personnel who are also devout practicing Christians. Participants will be recruited through local veterans' organizations and Christian churches. Interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for themes related to the role of cultural heritage in their lives.

Results:
Preliminary findings indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of retired military personnel. Participants spoke about how their cultural heritage shaped their sense of identity and belonging, and how it intersects with their religious beliefs and practices. Many participants expressed a deep sense of pride and loyalty to their country and military service, which is closely tied to their cultural heritage.
