Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for moderate, long-term newly married couples requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make these celebrations more welcoming and enjoyable:

1. Involve the couple in the planning process: Encourage the couple to participate in the planning process by asking for their input on the theme, decorations, food, and other aspects of the celebration. This will help them feel more invested in the event and ensure that it reflects their preferences.
2. Be sensitive to dietary restrictions: Many couples have specific dietary needs or preferences, such as vegetarian or gluten-free. Make sure to consider these requirements when planning the food and drinks for the celebration. Provide options that cater to different dietary needs and preferences.
3. Create a diverse guest list: Encourage guests from different backgrounds and cultures to attend the celebration. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere and allow the couple to share their cultural heritage with others.
4. Incorporate traditional dress from both sides: Encourage the couple and their guests to wear traditional clothing or accessories from their respective cultures. This will add an element of cultural exchange and appreciation to the celebration.
5. Play music from different cultures: Create a playlist that includes music from both sides of the couple's culture. This will help create a lively and inclusive atmosphere during the celebration.
6. Serve food from different cultures: Offer a variety of dishes that represent both sides of the couple's culture. This could include traditional dishes, desserts, or even street food from different countries.
7. Use decorations that reflect both cultures: Incorporate elements from both sides of the couple's culture in the decorations. This could include traditional colors, patterns, or symbols from each culture.
8. Create a cultural exchange program: Plan a cultural exchange program during the celebration where guests can share their cultural practices, traditions, and customs with each other. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere and foster greater understanding between cultures.
9. Offer language support: Provide translation services or interpretation during the celebration to ensure that all guests can fully participate and enjoy
