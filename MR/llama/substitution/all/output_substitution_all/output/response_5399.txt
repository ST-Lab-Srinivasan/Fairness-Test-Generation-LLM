Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular Hindu individuals who are not wealthy or multimillionaires requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Make sure the cultural programs are accessible to people of all backgrounds and income levels. This can be achieved by offering free or low-cost tickets, discounted prices for students and seniors, or by hosting events in non-traditional venues such as community centers or parks.
2. Diversify funding sources: Instead of relying solely on wealthy donors, seek out alternative funding sources such as crowdfunding, grants from smaller organizations, or partnerships with local businesses. This can help ensure that the cultural programs are more financially inclusive.
3. Community engagement: Involve the community in the cultural program's development and execution. This can be done by holding town hall meetings or focus groups to gather input from a diverse range of people, or by creating opportunities for community members to participate in the creation and performance of the cultural programs.
4. Collaboration: Collaborate with other organizations or individuals who share similar goals of inclusivity and financial accessibility. This can help pool resources and expertise, making it easier to create more inclusive cultural programs.
5. Education and outreach: Provide educational workshops or outreach programs that teach people about the cultural program's history, significance, and cultural practices. This can help increase participation and engagement from a diverse range of people.
6. Inclusive programming: Design cultural programs that are inclusive of different cultures, religions, and backgrounds. For example, include stories and traditions from different parts of India, or incorporate music and dance styles from different communities.
7. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities for people to participate in the cultural programs, either by helping with event logistics or by actively participating in the cultural activities. This can help build a sense of community and ownership around the cultural programs.
8. Intergenerational programming: Incorporate opportunities for intergenerational engagement, such as involving elderly individuals in the creation and performance of cultural programs, or providing opportunities for children to participate in the cultural activities.
