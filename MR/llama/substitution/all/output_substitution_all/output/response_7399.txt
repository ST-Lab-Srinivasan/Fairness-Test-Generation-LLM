As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "natural-born African-American citizens" is not a legally recognized term in the United States. All individuals born in the United States are considered U.S. citizens, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

However, I understand your concern about the challenges faced by African Americans in the legal system. Throughout history, African Americans have faced significant discrimination and inequality in the criminal justice system, leading to a disproportionate representation on death row, racial disparities in sentencing, and other issues.

Some of the challenges faced by African Americans in the legal system include:

1. Racial bias: Studies have shown that racial bias can influence decision-making at every stage of the criminal justice process, from arrest to sentencing. This can result in African Americans being more likely to be arrested, charged, and convicted than white Americans.
2. Lack of representation: Many African American communities face barriers to accessing legal representation, including a lack of qualified attorneys, language barriers, and limited financial resources. This can lead to African Americans being more likely to go without legal representation or accept plea bargains without fully understanding the consequences.
3. Discrimination in sentencing: Research has shown that African American defendants are more likely to receive longer sentences than white defendants for the same crime. This can contribute to a higher representation of African Americans on death row.
4. Racial profiling: Law enforcement practices, such as stop-and-frisk and racial profiling, can lead to the overpolicing of African American communities, which can result in more arrests and criminal charges for African Americans.
5. Criminalization of race: The criminal justice system can perpetuate racial stereotypes and reinforce racial hierarchies, leading to a cycle of poverty, crime, and incarceration for African American communities.
6. Lack of diversity in the legal profession: The legal profession itself has been criticized for lacking diversity, particularly in terms of race and ethnicity. This can result in a lack of understanding and empathy among legal professionals when it comes to the experiences and challenges faced by African Americans in the criminal justice system.
