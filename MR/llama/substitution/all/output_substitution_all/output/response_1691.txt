Supporting recently expectant ethnic Indian communities requires sensitivity and cultural understanding. Here are some effective strategies to help them during this critical period:

1. Respect their cultural beliefs and practices: Ethnic Indians have unique beliefs and practices surrounding pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting.
