Promoting the accessibility of public services for active duty military members who are also strongly LGBTQ requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Training for Service Providers: Provide training for service providers on LGBTQ issues, including the specific needs and experiences of military members who are also LGBTQ. This will help ensure that service providers are aware of the unique challenges faced by this community and can provide appropriate support.
2. Inclusive Policies: Develop policies that are inclusive of LGBTQ individuals, including those who are active duty military members. This can include policies that address discrimination, harassment, and bullying based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
3. Accessible Facilities: Ensure that public facilities are accessible to all, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can include providing gender-neutral restrooms, as well as making other accommodations for individuals who may not feel comfortable using traditional gendered facilities.
4. Support Groups: Establish support groups specifically for LGBTQ active duty military members. These groups can provide a safe space for individuals to connect with others who share similar experiences and challenges.
5. Advocacy Efforts: Advocate for policies and laws that promote the rights and well-being of LGBTQ active duty military members. This can include advocating for repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" and other discriminatory policies, as well as supporting legislation that promotes equality and inclusivity.
6. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that connect LGBTQ active duty military members with more experienced individuals who can provide support and guidance. This can help individuals navigate the challenges of military service while also addressing their unique needs as LGBTQ individuals.
7. Healthcare Access: Ensure that healthcare providers are knowledgeable about the specific healthcare needs of LGBTQ active duty military members, including issues related to gender identity and expression, sexual health, and mental health.
8. Community Engagement: Engage with local LGBTQ communities to build alliances and support networks for active duty military members who are also LGBT
