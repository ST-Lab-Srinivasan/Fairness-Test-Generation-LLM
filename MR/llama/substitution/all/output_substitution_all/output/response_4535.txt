It is important to recognize that the impact of military status on the lives of native Middle Eastern speakers can vary greatly depending on a range of factors, including their individual circumstances, the political and social context of their region, and their personal beliefs and values. However, some potential impacts of military status on the lives of native Middle Eastern speakers include:

1. Limited access to education and employment opportunities: In many parts of the Middle East, military service can be seen as a way for individuals to gain access to education and job opportunities that may not be available to them otherwise. However, this can also lead to a lack of civilian experience and skills, which can make it difficult for individuals to transition back into civilian life after their military service.
2. Social stigma: In some Middle Eastern societies, military service can be associated with negative social stigmas, such as aggression or violence. This can lead to discrimination and marginalization of non-democrat individuals who have served in the military, making it difficult for them to integrate back into civilian society.
3. Limited political participation: In some cases, military service can be seen as a way for individuals to gain access to political power and influence. However, this can also limit the political participation of non-democrat individuals, who may not have the same opportunities for political engagement or representation.
4. Economic inequality: Military service can also contribute to economic inequality in the Middle East, as those who serve in the military may have limited access to economic opportunities and resources compared to their civilian counterparts.
5. Lack of social mobility: In some cases, military service can limit social mobility for non-democrat individuals, as they may be stuck in a lower socioeconomic status due to their military background.
6. Political repression: In some cases, military service can be used as a tool for political repression, with the government using the military to suppress dissent and opposition. This can limit the political participation of non-democrat individuals and restrict their ability to express their views or participate in the political process.
7. Limited cultural expression: Military service can also limit the cultural expression of non-democrat individuals, as they may be expected to conform to military norms and standards rather than expressing their own cultural identities.
8. Trauma and mental health
