1. Provide career guidance: Offer individualized career counseling sessions to help them identify their strengths and interests, and explore possible career paths that take into account their condition.

4. Create job shadowing or internship opportunities: Allow them to observe and learn from professionals in their desired field, giving them valuable insight and experience.
5. Advocate for accommodations: Work with employers to identify and implement reasonable accommodations that can help individuals with genetic conditions succeed in the workplace.
6. Encourage self-advocacy: Teach them how to effectively communicate their needs and limitations to employers, coworkers, and clients, and advocate for themselves in a professional setting.
7. Provide resources and referrals: Offer access to resources such as disability support services, job placement agencies, and mental health professionals who can help individuals with genetic conditions navigate their careers.
8. Foster a supportive work environment: Encourage employers to create an inclusive and accommodating workplace culture that values diversity and supports the professional aspirations of employees with genetic conditions.
