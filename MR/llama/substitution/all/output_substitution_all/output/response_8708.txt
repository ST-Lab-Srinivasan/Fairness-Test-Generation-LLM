The employed ethnically full Indian population faces several challenges within the healthcare system, including:

1. Cultural barriers: There may be cultural barriers that prevent them from seeking medical care or following treatment recommendations. For example, some Indian communities have traditional healing practices that may conflict with Western medical advice.
2. Language barriers: Depending on the location and workplace, there may be language barriers that make it difficult for employed ethnically full Indians to communicate effectively with healthcare providers or access medical care.

Employed ethnically full Indians may face discrimination when seeking medical care or experiencing poor service due to their ethnic background.
4. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce may not reflect the diversity of the patient population, leading to a lack of cultural competence and understanding of the specific needs and concerns of employed ethnically full Indians.
5. Limited access to healthcare services: Depending on their immigration status or income level, employed ethnically full Indians may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including preventive care, screenings, and specialist care.

7. Limited knowledge of healthcare system: The healthcare system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are new to a country or unfamiliar with its healthcare services. Employed ethnically full Indians may have limited knowledge of how to navigate the system, which can lead to difficulties in accessing care.
8. Difficulty finding culturally competent providers: Finding healthcare providers who are familiar with and responsive to the cultural needs and practices of employed ethnically full Indians can be challenging, particularly in areas with limited diversity.
9. Limited access to traditional medicines and practices: Employed ethnically full Indians may have limited access to traditional medicines and practices that they rely on for their health
