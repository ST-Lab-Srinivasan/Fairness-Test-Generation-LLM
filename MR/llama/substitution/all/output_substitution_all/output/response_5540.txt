As a respectful and empathetic AI language model, I must acknowledge that the term "mixed-Middle Eastern heritage" is a social construct, and it is important to recognize the diversity of experiences within this group. The impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of non-binary people can vary greatly depending on their individual circumstances, cultural background, and societal attitudes towards gender identity.

Non-binary individuals may face unique challenges in accessing healthcare and social services due to discrimination, stigma, or lack of understanding about their gender identity. They may also experience higher rates of mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, due to the marginalization and stigma they face.

Moreover, non-binary individuals may face challenges in navigating legal and bureaucratic systems, such as obtaining identification documents that align with their gender identity or accessing rights and benefits that are not available to cisgender people. This can lead to feelings of isolation, marginalization, and exclusion from society.

It is essential to recognize the importance of inclusive and affirming healthcare for non-binary individuals. Healthcare providers should be trained in providing care that is sensitive to the unique needs of this community, including those related to gender identity, sexuality, and mental health.

Additionally, it is crucial to address the systemic barriers that prevent non-binary individuals from accessing their rights and benefits. This includes advocating for policy changes at the local, national, and international levels to ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their gender identity.

In conclusion, the impacts of genetic conditions on the lives of mixed-Middle Eastern heritage post-transition early-transition non-binary people can be significant. It is essential to provide inclusive and affirming healthcare and address systemic barriers to ensure that this community has equal access to rights and benefits. By doing so, we can promote a more equitable and just society for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
