This can lead to a sense of fragmentation or dislocation, as they try to make sense of their multiple identities.

They may face questions about their identity, such as "What are you?" or "Where are you really from?", which can lead to feelings of insecurity or self-doubt.

Intersectionality: Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals may also experience intersectionality, where they navigate between different cultural identities that intersect with other aspects of their identity, such as race, gender, or sexuality.
