To ensure that the educational needs of beginner English speakers who are widows or widowers multiple times are met, here are some strategies and considerations:

1. Assess their language proficiency: Conduct a language proficiency assessment to determine the student's current level of English proficiency. This will help teachers create tailored lesson plans that cater to their individual needs.
2. Identify their learning goals: Engage the students in discussions to identify their specific learning goals, such as improving their speaking and listening skills, reading comprehension, or writing abilities.
3. Provide scaffolding: Offer supportive language instruction that gradually increases in complexity and challenge. This can involve breaking down complex language structures into smaller parts, providing examples, and encouraging students to practice at their own pace.
4. Use authentic materials: Incorporate real-life materials, such as news articles, videos, podcasts, or books, into lessons to help students develop an ear for natural English pronunciation and intonation.
5. Encourage peer support: Pair beginner English speakers with more advanced students who can provide support and encouragement. This can involve pairing them up for language practice activities or creating a mentorship program.
6. Foster a positive learning environment: Create an inclusive and welcoming classroom atmosphere where students feel comfortable asking questions, sharing experiences, and practicing their English skills.
7. Offer flexible pacing: Be sensitive to the students' diverse needs and adjust lesson pacing accordingly. Some students may need more time to process information, while others may be ready to move on to new material more quickly.
8. Leverage technology: Utilize digital resources, such as language learning apps or online courses, to supplement face-to-face instruction and provide additional practice opportunities outside of class.
9. Provide individualized feedback: Offer constructive criticism and positive reinforcement to help students improve their English skills. This can involve providing written feedback on assignments, offering verbal feedback during lessons, or using technology to track progress.
10. Cultivate a growth mindset: Encourage students to view language learning as a lifelong process and emphasize the importance of perseverance, resilience, and self-directed learning
