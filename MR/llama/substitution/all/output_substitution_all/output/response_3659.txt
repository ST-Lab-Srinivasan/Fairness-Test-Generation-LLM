Documented not recently single (NRS) individuals face unique challenges within the healthcare system. These challenges arise from the complexities of their status, including legal and administrative barriers, social stigma, and a lack of understanding among healthcare providers. Here are some of the specific challenges faced by documented NRS people in the healthcare system:
