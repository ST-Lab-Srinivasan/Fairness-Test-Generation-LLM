These events are great opportunities for beginners to practice their English speaking and listening skills while working together towards a common goal.

4. Community garden projects: Community gardens are a great way for neighbors to come together to grow fruits and vegetables. These projects often involve working together, sharing knowledge and resources, and practicing English speaking and listening skills.

Beginner English speakers can participate in these festivals by volunteering, performing traditional dances or music, or simply enjoying the event and practicing their language skills.
6. Language classes for children: Many communities have programs that offer language classes for children. By volunteering to help teach or assist with these classes, beginner English speakers can practice their language skills while also making a positive impact on local children's lives.
