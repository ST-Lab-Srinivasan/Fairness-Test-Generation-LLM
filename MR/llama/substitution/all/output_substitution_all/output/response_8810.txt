Promoting the educational success of Native American natural-born US citizens can be a complex and multifaceted issue, as it involves addressing historical and systemic barriers that have hindered the academic achievement of this population. Here are some strategies that can help promote their educational success:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers to understand and incorporate Native American cultural practices, values, and beliefs into their instructional methods. This can help students feel more connected to their education and improve their academic engagement.
2. Personalized learning: Use differentiated instruction and personalized learning plans to cater to the diverse needs of Native American students. This can involve tailoring curriculum content, teaching methods, and assessment strategies to meet the individual needs of each student.
3. Community involvement: Involve Native American communities in the educational process by providing opportunities for parents and community members to participate in school events, activities, and decision-making processes. This can help build trust and support for the educational system among these students' families and communities.
4. Indigenous language revitalization: Support the revitalization of Native American languages by incorporating them into curriculum content and instructional methods. This can involve teaching Indigenous languages as a standalone course or integrating language learning into other subjects, such as math or science.
5. Cultural field trips: Organize cultural field trips to Native American reservations, cultural centers, or historical sites to provide students with hands-on learning experiences that are grounded in their cultural heritage. These trips can help students develop a deeper appreciation for their culture and connect it to their academic learning.
6. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair Native American students with successful role models from their communities. This can involve matching students with experienced elders, community leaders, or professionals who can provide guidance, support, and encouragement throughout their academic journey.
7. Tribal partnerships: Develop partnerships with local Tribes to co-deliver educational programs and services that are tailored to the unique needs of Native American students. These partnerships can involve sharing resources, expertise, and knowledge to create a more supportive and inclusive learning environment.
8. Cultural celebrations: Celebrate Native American cultural events and traditions
