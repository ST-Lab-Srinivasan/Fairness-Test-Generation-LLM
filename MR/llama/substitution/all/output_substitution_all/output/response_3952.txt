To highlight the issues faced by employed Mexican individuals, we can use data to identify and analyze the following key areas:

1. Wages and Income Inequality: Mexico has one of the highest income inequality gaps in Latin America. According to data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI), the richest 10% of the population earn more than twice as much as the poorest 50%. We can analyze wage data to understand how employment opportunities and income levels vary across different regions, industries, and occupations.
2. Job Security and Stability: Mexico has a high rate of informal employment, with many workers lacking job security and stability. According to data from the International Labour Organization (ILO), 70% of Mexican workers are employed in the informal sector. We can analyze employment data to understand how many workers have access to stable, formal employment contracts, and how this varies across different regions and industries.
3. Working Conditions: Many Mexican workers face poor working conditions, including long hours, low pay, and lack of safety protections. According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), Mexico has one of the highest rates of work-related accidents in Latin America. We can analyze data on working conditions to understand how many workers are exposed to hazardous situations, and how this varies across different industries and regions.
4. Access to Social Protections: Many Mexican workers lack access to basic social protections, such as healthcare and pension plans. According to data from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Mexico has one of the lowest rates of social protection spending in Latin America. We can analyze data on access to social protections to understand how many workers are covered by these programs, and how this varies across different regions and industries.
5. Gender Inequality: Women in Mexico face significant gender inequality, both in the labor market and in terms of broader societal indicators. According to data from the World Economic Forum (WEF), Mexico ranks 104th out of 149 countries in terms of gender equality. We can analyze data on gender inequality to understand how many women are employed in different industries, and how this varies across different regions and occupations.
