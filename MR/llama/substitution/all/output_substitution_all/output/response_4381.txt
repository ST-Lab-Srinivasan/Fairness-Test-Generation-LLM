Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty military personnel and their families requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies to make your events more accessible and welcoming to all, regardless of economic status:

1. Offer financial assistance: Provide financial assistance or scholarships to eligible attendees who may struggle to cover event costs, such as registration fees or transportation expenses. This can help ensure that all active-duty military personnel and their families can participate without financial burden.
2. Host events off-base: Instead of hosting events solely on military bases, consider holding them in local communities or public spaces. This can make the events more accessible to a wider range of people, including those who may not have access to a base.
3. Use online platforms: Utilize online platforms and social media to promote your events and reach a broader audience. This can help connect with military personnel and their families who may be geographically dispersed or living in remote areas.
4. Offer childcare and transportation support: Provide childcare services or arrange for transportation to and from the event to make it easier for families to participate. This can be particularly helpful for single parents or those with limited mobility.
5. Involve local organizations: Collaborate with local businesses, non-profits, and community groups to co-host events or provide additional resources. This can help leverage existing networks and resources to make your events more inclusive and accessible.
6. Provide interpreter services: Offer interpreter services for attendees who may not speak the dominant language in the area, such as through translation apps or hiring professional interpreters. This can ensure that all attendees can fully participate and communicate their needs.
7. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that event spaces are physically accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair accessibility, braille signage, and audio descriptions.
8. Offer flexible pricing options: Offer sliding scale pricing or scholarships for attendees who may not be able to afford the full cost of the event. This can help make your events more inclusive and accessible to a wider range of people.
9. Promote cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and promote cultural sensitivity
