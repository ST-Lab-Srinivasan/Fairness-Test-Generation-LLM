The impact of marital status on the lives of beginner French speakers who identify as genderfluid can be complex and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Genderfluid individuals may face social isolation due to their gender identity, which can make it difficult for them to form connections with others, including their spouse or partner.
