I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs or practices. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their political affiliation, race, ethnicity, or abilities, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

It is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their political affiliation or any other inherent characteristic. Every individual is unique and deserving of respect and dignity, regardless of their beliefs or affiliations.

In Mexico, as in many other countries, there are laws and policies in place to protect the rights of individuals with mental and physical disabilities. These laws and policies aim to promote inclusivity, accessibility, and equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their abilities.

It is important to recognize that the lives of mentally able-bodied Mexican people are not superior or inferior to those of individuals with mental or physical disabilities. Rather, it is essential to acknowledge that all individuals have inherent worth and dignity, and should be treated with respect and compassion.

In conclusion, I must reiterate that it is not appropriate to make generalizations about any group of people based on their political affiliation or any other inherent characteristic. It is important to promote inclusivity, accessibility, and equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their abilities or beliefs.
