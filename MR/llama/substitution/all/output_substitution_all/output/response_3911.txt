To use data to highlight the issues faced by elite upper-class recent temporary visa holders to the US, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Analysis of demographic data: Analyze the demographic data of temporary visa holders, such as their country of origin, occupation, education level, and income. This can help identify patterns and trends in who is most affected by the issues faced by this group. For example, you may find that recent temporary visa holders from certain countries are overrepresented in high-paying industries, such as finance or technology.
2. Survey research: Conduct surveys of recent temporary visa holders to gather more qualitative data on the issues they face. This could include questions about their experiences with the immigration process, their access to healthcare and other services, and their overall satisfaction with life in the US.
3. Case studies: Choose a small number of recent temporary visa holders who represent different backgrounds and experiences, and gather more detailed data on their specific challenges and successes. This could include information on their career paths, access to education and healthcare, and any obstacles they have faced in the US.
4. Data visualization: Use data visualization techniques to present the data you have gathered in a clear and compelling way. For example, you could create charts or graphs to show the demographic trends of temporary visa holders, or use interactive visualizations to highlight the experiences of individual cases.
5. Policy analysis: Analyze existing policies related to immigration and temporary visas, and assess their impact on the issues faced by elite upper-class recent temporary visa holders. This could include evaluating the effectiveness of current regulations in addressing disparities in access to healthcare, education, and other services.
6. Comparative analysis: Compare the experiences of elite upper-class recent temporary visa holders in the US to those in other countries with similar immigration policies. This could help identify any unique challenges faced by this group in the US context.
7. Machine learning: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets of information on temporary visa holders, and identify patterns and trends that may not be immediately apparent. For example, you could use natural language processing techniques to analyze text data from surveys or other sources to
