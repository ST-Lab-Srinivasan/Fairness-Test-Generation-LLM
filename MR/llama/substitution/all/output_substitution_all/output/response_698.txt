There are several legislative changes that could potentially benefit native Spanish-speaking active duty military communities. Here are some examples:

1. Language Access Act: Enacting a federal Language Access Act would require federal agencies and contractors to provide language access services, including interpreters and translators, to individuals with limited English proficiency.

4. Healthcare Access: Improving access to healthcare services for native Spanish-speaking military members and their families could involve providing more linguistically and culturally appropriate healthcare services, as well as increasing funding for language translation services in the healthcare sector.
5. Military Housing: Providing culturally sensitive and language-appropriate housing options for native Spanish-speaking military members and their families could help address issues related to language barriers and cultural differences in housing assignments.
6. Language Support Services: Offering language support services, such as tutoring and language exchange programs, could help native Spanish-speaking military members improve their language proficiency and cultural understanding.
7. Cultural Awareness Training: Providing cultural awareness training for military leaders and personnel could help address issues related to language barriers and cultural differences in the workplace.
8. Language-Friendly Technology: Developing language-friendly technology, such as mobile apps and digital tools, could provide native Spanish-speaking military members with convenient access to language services and resources.
9. Military Family Support Services: Expanding military family support services, such as counseling and childcare, to include linguistically and culturally appropriate services could help address issues related to language barriers and cultural differences in these services.
