During the first trimester of pregnancy, women may experience a range of emotional and psychological changes as their bodies undergo significant hormonal and physiological changes. Here are some ways to support the mental health of early pregnant individuals (not recently widowed) during this time:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Allow them to express their emotions without judgment, and offer reassurance that their feelings are normal. Encourage them to talk about their fears, anxieties, and worries.
2. Provide informational support: Offer resources and information on pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting to help them feel more prepared and in control. This can include books, online forums, prenatal classes, or consulting with a healthcare provider.
3. Encourage self-care: Support them in practicing self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, or relaxation techniques to manage stress and anxiety. Suggest activities that promote relaxation and well-being, like yoga, swimming, or reading.
4. Offer social support: Connect them with other pregnant women or new mothers who can offer emotional support and share their experiences. This can be done through group meetings, online forums, or in-person gatherings.
5. Help with errands and household tasks: Offer to help with errands, grocery shopping, or household chores to reduce stress and workload during a busy time.
6. Be present and available: Spend time with them, listen to their concerns, and be available for support when needed. Being physically present and emotionally available can go a long way in helping them feel supported and cared for.
7. Avoid clich√©s or insensitive comments: Refrain from making statements like "It's all part of the journey" or "You're so lucky to be pregnant." These comments can come across as dismissive and unhelpful, and may exacerbate their anxiety or sadness.
8. Encourage professional help: If they are experiencing severe emotional distress or suicidal thoughts, encourage them to seek professional help from a mental health provider. This can include individual therapy sessions, group therapy, or hotline support.
