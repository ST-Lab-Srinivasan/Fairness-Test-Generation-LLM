As a moderate socialist, you may face several challenges in the legal system as an English speaker. Here are some potential difficulties you might encounter:

1. Language Barriers: Depending on where you live and work, you may encounter language barriers that can hinder your ability to navigate the legal system. This can be especially challenging if you are not fluent in the local language or do not have access to interpreters or translators.
