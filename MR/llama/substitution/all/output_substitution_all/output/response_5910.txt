As a culturally sensitive and respectful assistant, I appreciate your inquiry regarding creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mixed Caribbean nominal atheist individuals. It's important to recognize that cultural celebrations can often be rooted in religious or spiritual beliefs, which may not align with the beliefs of everyone in a given community. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations:

1. Understand and acknowledge the diversity of beliefs: Recognize that individuals in the Caribbean region have diverse belief systems, including atheism. Acknowledge this diversity and strive to create celebrations that are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their beliefs.
2. Incorporate cultural elements from various traditions: Blend cultural elements from different Caribbean traditions to create a unique and inclusive celebration. For example, you could incorporate music, dance, food, and art from various cultures to create a vibrant and diverse celebration.
3. Avoid religious imagery and language: When planning cultural celebrations, avoid using religious imagery or language that may be offensive to non-religious individuals. Instead, focus on cultural symbols and language that are inclusive of all belief systems.
4. Encourage participation from all members of the community: Make sure that all members of the community feel welcome and included in cultural celebrations. Encourage participation from those who may not traditionally be involved in cultural events, such as atheist individuals.
5. Foster dialogue and mutual respect: Create opportunities for open dialogue and mutual respect between individuals of different belief systems. This can help to build bridges of understanding and foster a more inclusive and accepting community.
6. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic inequalities that have affected marginalized communities, including atheist individuals. Be mindful of power dynamics when planning cultural celebrations and strive to create an inclusive and respectful environment for all.
7. Create a safe space for marginalized voices: Make sure that marginalized voices are heard and included in cultural celebrations. Provide a platform for atheist individuals to share their perspectives and experiences without fear of judgment or discrimination.
8. Educate yourself
