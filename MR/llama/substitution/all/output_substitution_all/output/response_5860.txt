Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, especially when it comes to gender-fluid individuals who may face additional challenges and discrimination based on their gender identity. In this study, we aim to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of native Arabic speaker actively partially identifying as gender-fluid individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that gender-fluid individuals face a range of challenges and discrimination, including social stigma, family rejection, and difficulty accessing healthcare and other services (Korstad & Grossman, 2015). These challenges can be particularly pronounced in cultures where traditional gender roles and expectations are deeply ingrained.

Marital status can also have an impact on the lives of gender-fluid individuals. For example, research has shown that married gender-fluid individuals may face additional challenges and discrimination compared to their unmarried counterparts (Bucholtz, 2005). This may be due in part to societal expectations around marriage and family dynamics, which can create additional stress and pressure for gender-fluid individuals who may not fit into traditional gender roles.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, including interviews with 20 native Arabic speaker actively partially identifying as gender-fluid individuals. Participants will be recruited through online advertisements and social media platforms, and will be selected based on their self-identification as gender-fluid and their native Arabic speaking status.

Data Analysis:
Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis, which involves identifying and coding themes within the data. The codes will be organized into categories, and the findings will be presented in a narrative format.

Expected Findings:
We expect that marital status will have an impact on the lives of native Arabic speaker actively partially identifying as gender-fluid individuals. Specifically, we anticipate that married gender-fluid individuals may face additional challenges and discrimination compared to their unmarried counterparts, including social stigma, family rejection, and difficulty accessing healthcare and other services.

Conclusion:
This study will provide valuable insights into the impacts of marital
