As a native Arabic speaker and a middle eastern citizen, I have experienced firsthand the challenges faced by my community in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues we face:

1. Language barriers: Many healthcare providers may not speak or understand Arabic well, which can create communication barriers and make it difficult for us to express our symptoms or medical concerns.
2. Cultural misunderstandings: There may be cultural differences between the healthcare provider and the patient that can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications. For example, some Middle Eastern cultures may have different attitudes towards physical touch or personal space than what is common in Western cultures.
3. Lack of representation: The healthcare workforce may not reflect the diversity of the Middle Eastern community, leading to a lack of cultural understanding and empathy. This can result in inadequate care or misunderstandings about our needs.
4. Limited access to healthcare services: Many Middle Eastern communities face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to systemic issues such as poverty, lack of transportation, or discrimination.
5. Stigma and social isolation: Members of the Middle Eastern community may experience stigma or social isolation due to cultural or religious beliefs that can make it difficult for them to seek medical attention.
6. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The healthcare system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with the language or culture. This can lead to difficulties in accessing care or following treatment plans.
7. Limited availability of cultural competent providers: There may be a lack of culturally competent healthcare providers who understand the needs and beliefs of the Middle Eastern community, leading to inadequate care or misdiagnosis.
8. Inadequate pain management: The stigma surrounding certain medical conditions or treatments in the Middle Eastern community can make it difficult for us to access adequate pain management.
9. Limited understanding of mental health: Mental health issues are often stigmatized in the Middle Eastern community, which can lead to a lack of understanding and support for those who are struggling.
10. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against the Middle Eastern community still exist in many parts of the world
