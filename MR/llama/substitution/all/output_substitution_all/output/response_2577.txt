Impacts of Immigration Status on the Lives of Deaf Individuals in 3rd Trimester of Pregnancy:

1. Access to Healthcare: Deaf individuals who are undocumented or have temporary immigration status may face barriers when seeking medical attention, including prenatal care and delivery. They may be hesitant to seek help due to fear of deportation or lack of knowledge about their rights.
2. Language Barriers: For deaf individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of their host country, communication can be a significant challenge. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can have serious consequences during pregnancy and childbirth.
3. Social Isolationation: Deaf individuals may experience social isolation due to language barriers or discrimination. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, which can negatively impact their mental health and well-being during pregnancy.
4. Limited Access to Resources: Deaf individuals who are undocumented or have temporary immigration status may have limited access to resources such as prenatal care, birthing classes, and parenting support groups. This can lead to a lack of knowledge about prenatal care and childbirth, which can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth.
5. Fear of Discrimination: Deaf individuals may face discrimination in healthcare settings due to their immigration status or disability. This can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and fear of seeking medical attention, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being during pregnancy and childbirth.
6. Limited Access to Sign Language Interpreters: Deaf individuals may have limited access to sign language interpreters, which can make it difficult to communicate with healthcare providers and receive appropriate medical care.
7. Financial Stress: Deaf individuals who are undocumented or have temporary immigration status may face financial stress due to the cost of healthcare and other expenses related to pregnancy and childbirth. This can lead to a lack of access to necessary resources, such as prenatal care, which can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth.
8. Lack of Cultural Competency
