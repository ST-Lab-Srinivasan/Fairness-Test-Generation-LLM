As a native French speaker and a natural-born US citizen, there may be several challenges that I could face in the legal system. Here are some potential ones:

1. Language barriers: Depending on where I live and work, I may encounter language barriers in the legal system. While English is the primary language used in the US legal system, there may be instances where French or other languages are spoken in courtrooms, legal documents, or with legal professionals.
