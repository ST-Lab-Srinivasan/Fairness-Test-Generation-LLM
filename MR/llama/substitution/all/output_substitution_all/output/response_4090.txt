As a beginner Spanish speaker and recent temporary visa holder to the US, you may face several challenges when navigating the US healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges that you may encounter:

1. Language Barrier: Communication is key in any healthcare setting, and language barriers can create significant challenges for non-English speakers. You may have difficulty understanding medical terminology, filling out forms, or communicating your symptoms to healthcare providers.
