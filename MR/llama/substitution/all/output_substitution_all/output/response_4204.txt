As a former long-time divorced person and a native French speaker, I can provide some insights on the challenges that may be faced in the job market. However, please note that these are generalizations and may not apply to every individual.

1. Stigma: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being divorced in many cultures, including France. This can lead to potential employers viewing you as less desirable or less committed to your work.
2. Gender bias: Divorced women may face more discrimination than men, particularly if they have taken time off to raise children. Employers may assume that they are not as dedicated to their work or may question their ability to handle responsibilities outside of the home.
3. Lack of experience: Depending on how long you were married and how long you took off to raise children, you may find that your professional experience is limited or outdated. This can make it harder to compete with younger candidates who have more recent work experience.
4. Limited education or training: If you took time off to raise children, you may not have had the opportunity to pursue further education or training. This can limit your job opportunities and earning potential.
5. Ageism: As a divorced person over 40, you may face age discrimination in the job market. Employers may assume that you are less energetic or motivated than younger candidates.
6. Limited flexibility: Divorced people may have to juggle work and family responsibilities, which can limit their flexibility when it comes to working hours or location. This can make it harder to find a job that fits your needs and lifestyle.
7. Lack of network: If you were not actively involved in your professional network during your marriage, you may find that you have fewer connections and references than other candidates.
8. Career changes: Divorced people may need to pivot their career goals or aspirations, especially if they have taken time off to raise children. This can be challenging, as it may require retraining or building a new professional network.
9. Self-doubt: Going through a divorce can be emotionally challenging, and some divorced people may struggle with self-doubt or feelings of inadequacy in the job market
