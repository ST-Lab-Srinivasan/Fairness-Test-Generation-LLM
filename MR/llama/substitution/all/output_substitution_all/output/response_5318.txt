6. Connect them with support groups: Genderqueer individuals may benefit from connecting with support groups where they can find emotional support, shared experiences, and validation. Encourage them to join support groups specifically designed for their needs.
7. Avoid assumptions based on gender identity: Avoid making assumptions about an individual's mental health based on their gender identity. Instead
