As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that disability status does not define a person's identity or worth. Every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. However, I understand the context of your question and will provide a nuanced answer.

The impact of disability status on the lives of natural-born citizens can vary greatly, depending on various factors such as societal attitudes, access to resources and opportunities, and individual experiences. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face social isolation due to stigma, discrimination, or limited access to social spaces. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, low self-esteem, and depression.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Depending on the nature of their disability, individuals may face barriers in accessing quality education or finding employment opportunities. This can result in lower socio-economic status, reduced independence, and decreased sense of purpose.
3. Inadequate healthcare: People with disabilities may encounter challenges when seeking medical attention due to ableism, lack of accessibility in healthcare facilities, or inadequate training for healthcare providers. This can lead to poorer health outcomes, lower life expectancy, and reduced quality of life.
4. Resilience and adaptability: Despite facing various challenges, individuals with disabilities often develop resilience and adaptability as a coping mechanism. They may learn to rely on their support systems, advocate for themselves, or find creative solutions to overcome obstacles.
5. Political marginalization: Historically, people with disabilities have been marginalized in political discourse, receiving less representation and attention from policymakers. This can result in inadequate policies and services that fail to address their needs and rights.
6. Cultural representation: The underrepresentation or misrepresentation of people with disabilities in media and cultural spaces can perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce harmful attitudes towards disability.
7. Intersectionality: It's important to recognize that individuals with disabilities may experience multiple forms of discrimination based on their race, gender, sexuality, or other aspects of their identity.
