Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Widowed Multiple Times Beginner Spanish Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for those who have experienced multiple losses, including widowhood. As beginner Spanish speakers, these individuals may face additional challenges in navigating cultural norms and expectations. This study aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of widowed multiple times beginner Spanish speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity, particularly during times of loss and grief (Hall, 1976). For example, some cultures may place a greater emphasis on collectivist values, such as interdependence and shared responsibility, while others prioritize individualism (Hofstede, 1980). These cultural differences can affect how individuals cope with loss and construct their identities in the aftermath of widowhood.

Beginner Spanish speakers may face additional challenges in navigating cultural norms and expectations, particularly if they are not familiar with the language or customs of the host culture (Kim, 2013). This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from their own cultural heritage, as well as the host culture (Ward, 2006).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of beginner Spanish speakers who have experienced multiple losses, including widowhood. Participants will be recruited through community organizations and online forums, ensuring a diverse range of cultural backgrounds and language proficiency levels.

Data analysis will involve thematic analysis, focusing on the ways in which participants' cultural heritage shapes their identities during times of loss and grief. The following research questions will guide data collection and analysis:

1. How do beginner Spanish speakers experience cultural differences in the aftermath of widowhood?
2. What role does cultural heritage play in shaping the identities of widowed multiple times beginner Spanish speaker individuals?
3. How do participants navigate cultural norms and expectations
