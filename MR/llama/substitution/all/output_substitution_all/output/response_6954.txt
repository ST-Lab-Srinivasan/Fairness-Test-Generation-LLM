As a beginner Nigerian speaker who is happily long-time widowed for many years, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Stereotypes and bias: Unfortunately, there is a common stereotype that elderly people, especially those who have been widowed for a long time, are not as capable or productive as their younger counterparts. This can lead to ageism and bias in the job market, making it more difficult to secure employment.
2. Limited technical skills: As a beginner Nigerian speaker, you may lack the technical skills required for many jobs, especially those that involve modern technology. This can make it harder to compete with younger candidates who are more familiar with digital tools and platforms.
