Supporting the social inclusion of recent refugees in the United States, particularly those who have been married for a long time, requires a multifaceted approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language classes and cultural orientation: Provide language classes and cultural orientation programs to help refugees understand the customs and values of the US society. This will help them navigate everyday situations and communicate effectively with Americans.
2. Community-based programs: Develop community-based programs that bring refugees together with local residents, promoting mutual understanding and respect. Examples include intercultural dialogue events, cultural festivals, and volunteer opportunities.
3. Employment support: Offer job training and placement services to help refugees find employment in the US. This can include language training, resume building, and interview preparation.
4. Legal assistance: Provide legal aid to help refugees navigate the US immigration system, including obtaining work permits and citizenship.
5. Healthcare access: Ensure that refugees have access to quality healthcare services, including mental health support. Many refugees have experienced trauma and stress during their journey to the US, and these services can help them heal and recover.
6. Education and youth programs: Provide educational opportunities for children and young adults, including English language classes and extracurricular activities. This can help them integrate into the US education system and build social connections.
7. Housing support: Offer temporary or permanent housing options to help refugees settle into their new homes. This can include furniture donations, rental assistance, and home repairs.
8. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair refugees with local volunteers who can provide guidance and support in navigating US society.
9. Advocacy and awareness-raising: Collaborate with local organizations and community leaders to raise awareness about the challenges faced by refugees and the importance of inclusive policies. This can help build a more welcoming and supportive environment for refugees.
10. Capacity-building workshops: Host workshops and training sessions for local service providers, educators, and community leaders to enhance their understanding of refugee issues and
