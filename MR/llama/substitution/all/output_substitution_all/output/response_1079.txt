Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. In the Caribbean region, there are cultural and societal norms that may influence the experiences of beginner Caribbean speakers who are in their third trimester of pregnancy. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of these individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect an individual's mental and physical health, social relationships, and economic well-being (Galobardes et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2013). During pregnancy, the impact of marital status may be particularly pronounced due to the physiological and hormonal changes that occur in the body. For example, research has shown that married women tend to have better prenatal care and health outcomes compared to unmarried women (Grobman et al., 2015).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with beginner Caribbean speakers who are in their third trimester of pregnancy. Participants will be recruited through community health centers and obstetric clinics in the Caribbean region. The interview guide will explore participants' experiences of marital status and its impact on their lives during pregnancy.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the limited literature on the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner Caribbean speakers during pregnancy. By examining the experiences of these individuals, this research will provide insights into how cultural and societal norms shape the experiences of pregnant women in the Caribbean region. Findings from this study can inform the development of culturally sensitive interventions to support pregnant women, particularly those from marginalized communities.

Conclusion:
The impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner Caribbean speakers during their third trimester of pregnancy are not well understood. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by examining the experiences of these individuals and identifying the ways in which cultural and societal norms shape their experiences. Findings from this study can inform
