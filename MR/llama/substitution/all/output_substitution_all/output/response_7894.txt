Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberal Native Indian speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach to design, planning, and management. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive public spaces:

1. Inclusive Design: Involve diverse stakeholders, including non-liberal Native Indian speakers, in the design process to ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account. Use participatory design techniques such as workshops, focus groups, and surveys to gather feedback from these communities.

3. Language Support: Provide language support services such as signage in multiple languages, bilingual or multilingual staff, and translation services for non-liberal Native Indian speakers.
4. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and traditions of non-liberal Native Indian speakers. For example, provide designated areas for prayer or meditation, or allow individuals to wear traditional clothing or accessories in public spaces.
5. Education and Awareness: Offer educational programs and workshops that promote awareness and understanding of the diverse cultures and languages present in the community. This can help reduce misunderstandings and stereotypes, and foster a more inclusive environment.
6. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in public space design and management. Use participatory budgeting processes or other tools to involve local residents in decision-making.
7. Inclusive Programming: Develop programming that caters to the diverse needs and interests of non-liberal Native Indian speakers, such as cultural events, language classes, or community gatherings.
8. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve non-liberal Native Indian speaker communities, such as language schools or community centers, to leverage their expertise and resources in creating more inclusive public spaces.
9. Training for Public Space Staff: Provide training for staff working in public spaces on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. This can help ensure that staff are better equipped to serve diverse communities and
