Creating more inclusive cultural programs for long-time single, non-disabled individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to help make cultural programs more accessible and welcoming:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Avoid using terms like " disabled" or "handicapped," as these can be seen as stigmatizing. Instead, use language that emphasizes the individual's agency and autonomy, such as "person with a disability" or "individual with a mobility impairment."
2. Accessible facilities: Ensure that the cultural program takes place in a physically accessible location. This includes having ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Consider providing American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation or CART services for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Adaptive technology: Provide adaptive technology, such as audio describers or tactile graphics, to help individuals with visual impairments participate in the cultural program. This can include providing large print materials or Braille documents upon request.
4. Sensory-friendly environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by minimizing loud noises and bright lights. Offer earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones for individuals who may be sensitive to these stimuli. Provide a quiet area for individuals who may need a break from the main activity.
5. Accommodations for different learning styles: Recognize that individuals learn in different ways and provide accommodations accordingly. For example, provide visual aids or verbal descriptions for individuals who are auditory learners. Offer extra time for individuals who may need it to complete tasks or assignments.
6. Involve individuals with disabilities in the planning process: Involve individuals with disabilities in the planning and implementation of cultural programs. This can help ensure that the program is accessible and inclusive for all participants. Consider forming a disability advisory committee to provide input and guidance on how to make the program more inclusive.
7. Provide training and education: Provide training and education for staff, volunteers, and participants on accessibility and inclusion. This can help create a culture of inclusion and respect for individuals with disabilities.
