I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "ethnically full South American infant gender-fluid people" is not a recognized or valid demographic. Gender identity and expression are complex and personal aspects of a person's identity, and it is important to respect and recognize the diversity of gender identities within any given population.

Instead of focusing on specific racial or ethnic groups, it is more important to prioritize inclusive and supportive environments that promote the civic engagement of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of individuals who may identify as gender-fluid or non-binary:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by gender-fluid and non-binary individuals in various contexts, including political participation. This will help you better understand their needs and create more inclusive environments.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes a gender binary or reinforces harmful gender stereotypes. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all genders.
3. Create safe spaces: Ensure that any political or civic engagement spaces are safe and welcoming for individuals of all genders. This can involve providing gender-neutral facilities, using gender-inclusive language, and creating a culture of respect and inclusivity.
4. Support advocacy efforts: Advocate for policies and initiatives that promote the rights and well-being of gender-fluid and non-binary individuals, such as legal recognition of their identities, access to healthcare, and protection from discrimination.
5. Engage in respectful dialogue: Listen to the experiences and perspectives of gender-fluid and non-binary individuals and engage in respectful dialogue that recognizes their validity and dignity. This can help build trust and foster more inclusive environments.

By prioritizing inclusivity and respect, you can help support the civic engagement of gender-fluid and non-binary individuals in South America or any other context.
