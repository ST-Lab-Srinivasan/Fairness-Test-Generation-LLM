Introduction:

Immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly for those who are natural-born citizens or have recently become naturalized citizens. In the case of English people, there are various factors that come into play, including legal and social implications, cultural identity, and access to benefits and services. This report will examine the impacts of immigration status on the lives of natural-born and recently naturalized citizen English people, highlighting the challenges they face and the ways in which their experiences differ from those of non-immigrant populations.

Legal Implications:

One of the most significant impacts of immigration status is the legal implications it has on an individual's life. Naturalized citizens have gained the right to reside and work in the UK permanently, but they may still face restrictions on their ability to travel or access certain benefits. For example, some naturalized citizens may be required to carry a specific visa or documentation when traveling abroad, which can cause delays or difficulties during international travel.

Additionally, there are legal requirements for naturalized citizens to maintain their residency in the UK and avoid any periods of absense that exceed a certain duration. This can create challenges for those who may need to travel for work or personal reasons, as they may need to obtain special permission or face potential consequences such as loss of residency status.

Social Implications:

Immigration status can also have significant social implications for natural-born and recently naturalized citizen English people. Discrimination and prejudice against immigrant populations are common in many parts of the UK, which can lead to feelings of isolation and exclusion among immigrant communities.

Moreover, cultural identity can be a complex issue for those who have dual or multiple identities based on their immigration status. Naturalized citizens may struggle to reconcile their pre-migration identity with their new national identity, leading to feelings of confusion or disconnection from their cultural heritage.

Access to Benefits and Services:

Naturalized citizens may face challenges when accessing certain benefits and services due to their immigration status. For instance, they may be eligible for some public services but not others, such as healthcare or education, depending on their residency status.
