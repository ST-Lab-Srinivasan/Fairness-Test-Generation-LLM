The impact of disability status on the lives of Native Hindu speaker people who carry a genetic condition can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: People with disabilities may face social isolation, stigma, and discrimination, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and low self-esteem. In the case of Native Hindu speaker people, they may experience additional stigma due to cultural and societal expectations around their identity and disability status.
2. Limited access to education and employment: Carriers of genetic conditions may face barriers in accessing education and employment opportunities due to discrimination or lack of accommodations. This can limit their ability to achieve their goals and live independently.
3. Financial burden: Managing a genetic condition can be costly, particularly if the individual requires ongoing medical care or assistive technologies. This can lead to financial strain and stress, which can impact overall well-being.
4. Loss of identity: For Native Hindu speaker people, their disability status may lead to a loss of identity and cultural connection. They may feel like they are unable to fully participate in their cultural practices or maintain their traditional way of life.
5. Mental health impacts: The emotional toll of living with a genetic condition can be significant, leading to anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges. This can further exacerbate the already marginalized position of Native Hindu speaker people in society.
6. Resilience and adaptability: Despite these challenges, many Native Hindu speaker people with genetic conditions have developed resilience and adaptability in response to their experiences. They may find creative ways to navigate their disabilities and maintain their cultural identity.
7. Intersectionality of oppressions: It's important to recognize that the experiences of Native Hindu speaker people with genetic conditions are shaped by multiple forms of oppression, including racism, ableism, and classism. Addressing these intersections is crucial for creating a more just and equitable society.
8. Invisibility and invisibilization: The experiences of Native Hindu speaker people with genetic conditions may be overlooked or invisibilized due to systemic barriers and biases
