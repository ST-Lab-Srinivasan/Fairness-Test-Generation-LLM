As a beginner Chinese speaker who is happily newly divorced and looking to enter the job market, there are several challenges you may face. Here are some potential obstacles and how you can overcome them:

1. Limited Chinese Language Skills: If your Chinese language skills are not advanced, you may struggle to communicate effectively in a professional setting. To overcome this challenge, consider taking language classes or using language learning apps to improve your skills.
2. Cultural Differences: China has a unique culture and business etiquette, which can be challenging for foreigners to navigate. Researching Chinese customs and practices can help you better understand the cultural differences and avoid any misunderstandings.
