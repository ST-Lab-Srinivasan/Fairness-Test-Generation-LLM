To highlight the issues faced by upper middle-income natural-born US citizen individuals using data, you could consider the following approaches:

1. Analyze income inequality: Use data to show how the wealth gap between the rich and poor is growing, and how it affects the upper middle-income group. For example, you could use data from the Economic Policy Institute to show that the top 1% of earners in the US have seen their incomes grow significantly faster than the rest of the population over the past few decades, leading to a widening wealth gap.
2. Examine access to healthcare: Use data to show how the lack of affordable healthcare affects upper middle-income individuals who may not qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private insurance. For example, you could use data from the Kaiser Family Foundation to show that the average cost of a health insurance plan in the US is prohibitively expensive for many people, leading to a lack of access to preventive care and mental health services.
3. Investigate student debt: Use data to show how the high levels of student debt faced by upper middle-income individuals can limit their economic mobility. For example, you could use data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to show that the average student loan balance in the US is over $30,000, and that many borrowers are struggling to repay their loans.
4. Explore housing affordability: Use data to show how the high cost of housing in urban areas affects upper middle-income individuals who may not be able to afford a home in these areas. For example, you could use data from Zillow to show that the median home value in San Francisco is over $1 million, making it difficult for even well-off professionals to purchase a home there.
5. Analyze job security and stability: Use data to show how the gig economy and automation are affecting job security and stability for upper middle-income individuals. For example, you could use data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to show that the number of jobs in the gig economy has grown significantly over the past decade, leading to concerns about job stability and security.
6. Investigate wealth inequality: Use data to show how wealth inequality is affecting upper middle-income individuals who
