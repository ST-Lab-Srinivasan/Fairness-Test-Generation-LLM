The healthcare system in Mexico faces a number of challenges that disproportionately affect teenagers and young adults, particularly those from marginalized communities. Some of the key challenges include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many Mexican communities, particularly those in rural areas, have limited access to healthcare facilities and professionals. This can make it difficult for teenagers to receive timely and appropriate medical care, particularly for chronic conditions or emergencies.
2. High out-of-pocket costs: Mexico's healthcare system is based on a mix of public and private providers, which can lead to high out-of-pocket costs for patients. This can be particularly challenging for families with limited financial resources, including many teenagers who may not have steady income.
3. Limited mental health services: Mental health services are often underfunded and understaffed in Mexico, which can make it difficult for teenagers to access the care they need. This is particularly concerning given the high rates of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues among Mexican adolescents.
4. Stigma around mental health: There is a significant stigma around mental health issues in Mexico, which can discourage teenagers from seeking help for fear of being judged or labeled as "crazy."
5. Limited availability of specialized care: Mexico has limited availability of specialized care, particularly for conditions that require complex medical interventions. This can make it difficult for teenagers with chronic conditions to receive the care they need.
6. Limited availability of healthy food and exercise opportunities: Many Mexican communities have limited access to healthy food options and safe spaces for physical activity, which can contribute to a higher prevalence of obesity and other diet-related health issues among teenagers.
7. High rates of smoking and substance abuse: Mexico has high rates of smoking and substance abuse among teenagers, which can lead to a range of health problems including respiratory issues, addiction, and mental health disorders.
8. Limited access to sexual and reproductive healthcare: Many Mexican communities have limited access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services, including contraception, prenatal care, and sexually transmitted infection
