Creating inclusive community events for beginner Middle Eastern speakers in a high-income income area can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help make these events more accessible and welcoming. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide language support: Offer translation services or interpreters at the event to help beginners who may not be fluent in the target language. This can include providing headsets with live translations or using visual aids like real-time subtitles.
2. Simplify the language: Use simple language and avoid jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to beginner learners. Keep the explanations concise and easy to understand.
3. Use inclusive marketing: Advertise the event through various channels, including social media, flyers, and posters. Make sure the language used in the marketing materials is inclusive and welcoming to all.
4. Offer beginner-friendly activities: Plan activities that are easy for beginners to participate in, such as cultural workshops or games that don't require advanced language skills.
5. Create a supportive environment: Encourage attendees to help each other learn and practice the target language. This can be done through group exercises or pairing beginners with more advanced speakers for language exchange.
6. Provide resources: Offer additional language learning resources, such as books, apps, or online courses, to help beginners improve their skills outside of the event.
7. Be sensitive to cultural differences: Be respectful of attendees' cultural backgrounds and avoid cultural stereotypes or assumptions that may be offensive.
8. Involve the community: Reach out to local organizations or schools to involve the broader community in the event planning process. This can help ensure that the event is inclusive and representative of the local population.
9. Offer childcare: Provide childcare services during the event to make it more accessible to parents who may want to participate but have childcare responsibilities.
10. Follow up with attendees: After the event, follow up with attendees to gather feedback and suggestions for future events. This can help improve the inclusivity of future events and ensure that they are tailored to the needs of beginner Middle Eastern speakers
