As a beginner French speaker and an African American, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system in France. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for beginners is the language barrier. French is the official language of France, and not everyone speaks English fluently. This can make it difficult to communicate with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who may not speak English.
2. Cultural differences: As an African American, you may face cultural differences in the legal system in France. The legal system in France is based on a civil law system, which can be quite different from the common law system used in the United States. For example, in France, the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, while in the US, the burden of proof is on the defendant to prove innocence.
3. Lack of diversity: The legal profession in France may lack diversity, particularly when it comes to people of color. This can make it difficult for you to find lawyers who understand your experiences and perspectives.
4. Bias: Unfortunately, bias still exists in the legal system, particularly against people of color. As an African American, you may face discrimination or biased treatment in the legal system.
5. Limited resources: As a beginner French speaker, you may have limited access to legal resources and support. This can make it difficult to navigate the legal system and advocate for yourself.
6. Different legal framework: The legal framework in France is different from that of the US, which can make it difficult for beginners to understand the laws and regulations that apply to them.
7. Limited access to legal aid: In France, there are limited resources for legal aid, particularly for those who are not French citizens. This can make it difficult for people who cannot afford legal representation to access the justice system.
8. Difficulty in finding a lawyer who speaks English: Many lawyers in France do not speak English fluently, which can make it difficult for beginners to find legal representation.
9. Limited understanding of French laws and regulations: As a beginner French speaker, you may have limited understanding of French laws and regulations, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system.
