2. Support for recently widowed individuals:
	* Offer counseling services and emotional support to recently widowed individuals to help them cope with their loss.
	* Provide temporary accommodations such as additional storage or flexible lease terms to help recently widowed individuals adjust to their new living situation.
	* Ensure that building codes and safety standards are adapted to meet the needs of recently widowed individuals, such as providing safe and accessible elevators, ramps, and bathroom facilities.
3. Avoiding discrimination:
	* Develop a clear and comprehensive non-discrimination policy that prohibits discrimination based on pregnancy or recent widowhood.
	* Train building staff and management on the policy to ensure consistent application.
	* Establish a complaint process for individuals who experience discrimination, and provide resources for legal support if necessary.
4. Accessibility features:
