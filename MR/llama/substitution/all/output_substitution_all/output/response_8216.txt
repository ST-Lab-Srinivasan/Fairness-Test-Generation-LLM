The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of non-democratic and non-wealthy individuals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Loss of personal freedoms: In authoritarian regimes, the military may be used to suppress dissent and opposition, leading to a curtailment of personal freedoms such as speech, assembly, and association. Non-democratic individuals may find themselves living in a state of constant surveillance and fear.
