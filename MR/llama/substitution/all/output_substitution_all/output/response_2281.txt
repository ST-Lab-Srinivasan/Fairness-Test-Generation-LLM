As a mixed Japanese heritage person learning Arabic, you may face several challenges when interacting with the legal system. Here are some potential obstacles you might encounter:

1. Language barrier: If you are not fluent in Arabic, you may struggle to understand legal documents, procedures, and terminology. This can make it difficult for you to navigate the legal system and advocate for yourself or your family members.
2. Cultural differences: The legal systems of Japan and the Arab world have different customs, traditions, and expectations.
