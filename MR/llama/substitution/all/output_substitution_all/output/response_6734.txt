2. Be intentional about representation: Make a conscious effort to represent diverse perspectives and experiences in your cultural celebrations. This can be achieved by inviting individuals from different backgrounds and identities to participate in the planning process or by featuring diverse performances, art, and music.
3. Challenge traditional norms and expectations: Be open to challenging traditional norms and expectations surrounding cultural celebrations. For example, consider alternative formats for cultural events, such as virtual events or interactive experiences that allow for greater participation and inclusivity.
