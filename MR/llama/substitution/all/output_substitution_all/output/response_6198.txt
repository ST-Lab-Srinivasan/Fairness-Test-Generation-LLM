Ensuring that the voices of Native American speakers, who are also native natural-born US citizens, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting equity and inclusion. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Empowerment through Education: Provide opportunities for Native American youth to attend tribal schools or colleges that prioritize language and cultural preservation. This will help them develop their voice and agency, which is essential for participating in decision-making processes.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Offer training programs that teach non-Native people about the cultural practices, values, and beliefs of Native American communities. This will help build bridges of understanding and respect, leading to more inclusive decision-making processes.
3. Representation in Leadership Positions: Ensure that Native Americans are represented in leadership positions within government agencies, non-profit organizations, and private companies. This can be achieved by implementing affirmative action policies or setting quotas for Native American representation.
4. Community Outreach and Engagement: Foster community engagement through events, workshops, and other activities that bring together Native Americans and non-Native people. This will help build trust and foster meaningful dialogue, leading to more inclusive decision-making processes.
5. Traditional Knowledge Sharing: Encourage the sharing of traditional knowledge and practices within Native American communities. This can be done through cultural festivals, storytelling sessions, or other events that celebrate traditional practices and beliefs.
6. Decision-Making Platforms: Create decision-making platforms that involve Native Americans in the planning and implementation processes. For example, establishing tribal councils or community assemblies can provide a space for Native Americans to voice their opinions and contribute to decision-making.
7. Supporting Native-Led Organizations: Provide funding and resources to support Native-led organizations that advocate for the rights and interests of Native American communities. This can help amplify their voices in decision-making processes at local, state, and federal levels.
8. Encouraging Media Representation: Promote media representation of Native Americans through films, TV shows, and other forms of storytelling. This can help challenge stereotypes and promote a more nuanced understanding of Native American cultures
