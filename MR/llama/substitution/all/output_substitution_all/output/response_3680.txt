Introduction:
Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, including those who are recent long-term divorcees. The effects of disability can be felt in various aspects of life, including social, economic, and psychological well-being. This study aims to investigate the specific impacts of disability status on the lives of permanent resident long-term recently divorced people.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that individuals with disabilities are more likely to experience social isolation, stigma, and discrimination compared to those without disabilities (Henderson & Menzies, 2016). Disability can also lead to reduced economic opportunities, including lower earning potential and limited access to employment (World Health Organization, 2019). Moreover, individuals with disabilities are at a higher risk of experiencing mental health problems such as anxiety and depression due to the challenges they face in their daily lives (WHO, 2017).

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample will consist of permanent resident long-term recently divorced people with disabilities living in urban areas of a developing country. A survey questionnaire will be administered to participants to gather quantitative data on their socio-demographic characteristics, social support networks, economic status, and mental health. Semi-structured interviews will also be conducted to collect qualitative data on the participants' experiences of disability and its impact on their daily lives.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the existing literature on disability by exploring the unique challenges faced by permanent resident long-term recently divorced people with disabilities in a developing country context. The findings will provide valuable insights into the experiences of this marginalized group and inform policies and interventions aimed at improving their well-being.

Conclusion:
Disability can have significant impacts on the lives of permanent resident long-term recently divorced people, including social isolation, stigma, and reduced economic opportunities. This study will investigate these impacts in a developing country context and provide recommendations for policymakers and practitioners to address the challenges faced by this marginalized group.
