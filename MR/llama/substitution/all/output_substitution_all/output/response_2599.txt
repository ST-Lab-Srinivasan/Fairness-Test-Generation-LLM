As a beginner Chinese speaker, there are several challenges that you may face when interacting with the healthcare system in China at the age of 65. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for elderly Chinese learners is the language barrier. Many healthcare providers may not speak English or other languages fluently, making it difficult for seniors to communicate their medical needs and concerns.
2. Cultural differences: China has a unique culture and way of life that may be unfamiliar to elderly foreigners. Understanding the cultural nuances of the healthcare system can help avoid misunderstandings and ensure better care.
3. Limited accessibility: Depending on where you live in China, there may be limited accessibility to healthcare services, especially in rural areas. This can make it challenging for seniors to receive timely and appropriate medical care.
4. Lack of familiarity with the system: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may not be familiar with the healthcare system in China, including the different types of hospitals, clinics, and specialists available. This lack of knowledge can make it difficult to navigate the system and receive appropriate care.
5. Limited mobility: Many elderly people may have limited mobility or live in areas with poor public transportation, making it challenging to access healthcare services.
6. Stigma associated with aging: In some cultures, there is a stigma associated with aging, which can make it difficult for seniors to seek medical care.
7. Limited social support: Elderly people may face challenges in accessing social support from family and friends due to geographical distance or cultural differences.
8. Lack of access to technology: Some elderly people may not have access to technology, such as smartphones or computers, which can limit their ability to communicate with healthcare providers or access medical information.
9. Limited financial resources: Many elderly people may face financial challenges, making it difficult to afford medical care or pay for prescription medications.
10. Lack of trust in the system: Some elderly people may not trust the healthcare system due to past experiences or cultural beliefs, which can make it challenging to seek medical care.
