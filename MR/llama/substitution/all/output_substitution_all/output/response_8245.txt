Creating more inclusive community programs for active duty military personnel who are not recently single individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make your programs more inclusive:

1. Understand the needs of the community: Conduct research or surveys to understand the unique challenges faced by active duty military personnel who are not recently single, such as childcare responsibilities, deployment schedules, and financial constraints. Use this information to tailor your programs to meet their specific needs.
2. Offer flexible programming: Design your programs to be flexible and adaptable to the diverse schedules and needs of military personnel. For example, offer online or hybrid programs that can accommodate different time zones and deployment schedules.
3. Provide childcare support: Military families often face unique challenges related to childcare, such as frequent moves and deployments. Consider offering childcare services or resources to help alleviate some of these burdens.
4. Offer financial assistance: Many military personnel face financial constraints due to their low pay and limited benefits. Consider offering financial assistance or resources to help them cover basic needs, such as housing, food, and transportation.
5. Provide mental health support: Military personnel often face unique stressors related to their service, including deployment, combat exposure, and the transition back to civilian life. Offer mental health services or resources to help them manage these challenges.
6. Engage with military spouses: Military spouses often face unique challenges related to their partner's service, such as isolation and loneliness. Consider offering programs specifically tailored to their needs, such as social events, networking opportunities, and financial management workshops.
7. Build partnerships with military organizations: Collaborate with military organizations, such as the USO or the Military Order of the Purple Heart, to leverage their expertise and resources when designing programs for military personnel.
8. Educate your staff: Provide training for your staff on the unique needs and challenges faced by military personnel, so they can better understand how to support them.
9. Be flexible and adaptable: Be willing to make changes to your programs based on feedback from military personnel and their families.
10. Celebrate military culture: Embrace the rich culture and traditions of the military community and incorporate them into your programs
