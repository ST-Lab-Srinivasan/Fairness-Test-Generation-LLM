Creating more inclusive social policies for Mexican middle-aged transgender individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this community. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge and validate their experiences: Listen to the experiences and challenges faced by middle-aged transgender individuals in Mexico, and acknowledge the discrimination and marginalization they have faced throughout their lives. This includes recognizing the intersectionality of their identities, such as race, class, and ability.
2. Provide access to healthcare: Ensure that middle-aged transgender individuals have access to affirming and comprehensive healthcare services, including hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and gender-affirming surgeries. This should be done in a culturally sensitive manner, taking into account the specific needs of this community.
3.

6. Create safe spaces: Establish community centers or other safe spaces where middle-aged transgender individuals can socialize, access support services, and connect with others who share similar experiences. This can help build a sense of community and belonging, which is essential for mental and emotional well-being.
7. Address family and relationship issues: Provide counseling and support services to help middle-aged transgender individuals navigate their relationships with family members and partners, who may be unsupportive or even hostile. This can help reduce the negative impact of these relationships on
