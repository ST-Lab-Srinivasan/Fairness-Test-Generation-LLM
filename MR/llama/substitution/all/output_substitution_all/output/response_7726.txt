As a Mandarin-speaking Italian citizen, there may be several challenges that you may face in the healthcare system in Italy. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barriers: As a Mandarin speaker, you may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak Mandarin. This can make it harder to express your symptoms, ask questions, and understand medical instructions.
