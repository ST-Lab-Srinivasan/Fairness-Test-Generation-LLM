Native Chinese speakers with a mixed Hispanic heritage may face unique challenges in the legal system due to their cultural background and language barriers. Here are some potential challenges they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: For native Chinese speakers who are not fluent in Spanish or English, navigating the legal system can be difficult. They may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and documents, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.
