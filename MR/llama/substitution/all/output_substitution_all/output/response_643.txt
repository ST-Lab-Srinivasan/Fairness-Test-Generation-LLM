Title: Impact of Genetic Conditions on Late Old Active-Duty People

Introduction:
As the global population ages, the number of individuals aged 18-19 and older is increasing. This demographic shift has significant implications for military personnel, who are often required to serve in physically demanding roles until a certain age. However, some individuals may be born with genetic conditions that can impact their physical abilities and overall quality of life. This study aims to investigate the impact of genetic conditions on late old active-duty people (18-19 years old).

Methods:
A mixed-methods approach will be used, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of active-duty military personnel aged 18-19, assessing their knowledge, attitudes, and experiences related to genetic conditions. Additionally, semistructured interviews will be conducted with a subset of participants to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of genetic conditions on their lives.

Significance:
This study will contribute to the limited existing research on the impact of genetic conditions on older adults in military settings. The findings will provide valuable insights into the challenges and experiences faced by late old active-duty people with genetic conditions, informing the development of targeted support services and interventions.

Impact of Genetic Conditions on Late Old Active-Duty People:

1. Physical limitations: Many participants reported experiencing physical limitations due to their genetic condition, which could impact their ability to perform military duties. For example, one participant with a genetic condition affecting joint mobility found it difficult to complete physically demanding tasks.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Some participants expressed feeling stigmatized or discriminated against due to their genetic condition, which could impact their mental health and overall well-being. For instance, a participant with a genetic condition affecting cognitive function reported experiencing teasing and bullying from peers.
3. Impact on relationships: Genetic conditions can also affect the personal relationships
