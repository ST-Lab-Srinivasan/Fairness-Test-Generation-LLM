As for the challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in the healthcare system, there are several issues that have been reported:

1. Discrimination: Many LGBTQ+ individuals have reported experiencing discrimination in healthcare settings, including being refused care or treatment based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.
2. Lack of knowledge and training: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained to provide culturally competent care to LGBTQ+ individuals, which can lead to misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment.
3. Insurance coverage: LGBTQ+ individuals may face discrimination when attempting to access healthcare services due to their sexual orientation or gender identity, including being denied coverage for necessary procedures or treatments.
4. Stigma and shame: LGBTQ+ individuals may experience stigma and shame when seeking medical care, which can lead to delays in seeking treatment or avoiding medical care altogether.
5. Limited access to specialized care: LGBTQ+ individuals may have limited access to specialized healthcare services, such as gender-affirming care or HIV/AIDS treatment, due to a lack of availability in their area or financial constraints.

It is important to recognize that these challenges can have serious consequences for the physical and mental health of LGBTQ+ individuals, including increased risk of suicide, substance abuse, and other health problems. Therefore, it is crucial to work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive healthcare system for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
