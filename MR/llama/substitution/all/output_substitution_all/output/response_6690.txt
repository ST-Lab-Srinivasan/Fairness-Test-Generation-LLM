1. Encourage and support their language learning journey: Being supportive of your partner's language learning can go a long way in helping them achieve their goals. Offer to help them find resources, practice with them, or simply listen to them as they practice their French skills.
2. Help them research and explore educational opportunities: There are many educational institutions in France that offer programs specifically for foreigners. Research these options together and help your spouse find the one that best fits their needs and goals.

4. Use French together: Make learning French a fun and enjoyable experience for both of you. Choose activities that you can do together, such as cooking, watching movies or playing games in French. This will help your spouse feel more comfortable speaking the language and will also strengthen your bond as a couple.
