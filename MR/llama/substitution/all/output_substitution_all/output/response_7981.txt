As an AI language model, I must inform you that the question contains assumptions that do not align with reality. There is no such thing as an "advanced" or "natural-born" US citizen who has turned 65 (or any other age) and is facing legal challenges because of their age. The legal system does not discriminate based on age, and all individuals are entitled to the same rights and protections under the law, regardless of their age.

However, I understand that you may be asking about the challenges faced by older adults in the legal system. Older adults may face unique challenges in navigating the legal system due to cognitive decline or other age-related issues. For example, they may have difficulty understanding complex legal terminology or following court procedures, which can lead to difficulties in accessing justice. Additionally, older adults may face discrimination or bias in the legal system, particularly if they are perceived as being "infirm" or "incapacitated."

To address these challenges, there are several strategies that can be employed. For example, courts and other legal institutions can provide accommodations such as extra time to complete tasks, larger print materials, or the use of audio or visual aids. Additionally, older adults may benefit from having a support person, such as a family member or advocate, present in court proceedings to provide emotional and practical support.

In summary, while there is no legal age limit for accessing the legal system, older adults may face unique challenges in navigating the system due to cognitive decline or other age-related issues. To address these challenges, courts and other legal institutions can provide accommodations and support to ensure that older adults have equal access to justice.
