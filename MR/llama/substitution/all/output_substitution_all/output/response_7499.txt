As an AI language model, I cannot provide legal advice or create content that promotes or facilitates illegal activities. However, I can provide some general information on the challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers who are undocumented natural-born US citizen people in the legal system.

Undocumented immigrants face numerous challenges in the legal system, including difficulty accessing basic rights and services due to their immigration status. Some of the specific challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers in this situation include:

1. Language barriers: Beginner Arabic speakers may face difficulties navigating the legal system due to language barriers. Many court proceedings, legal documents, and other important information may only be available in English, making it hard for non-English speakers to understand their rights and responsibilities.
2. Lack of access to legal resources: Undocumented immigrants often face financial constraints that limit their access to legal resources such as lawyers, interpreters, and legal aid organizations. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
3. Fear of deportation: The fear of deportation is a significant challenge faced by many undocumented immigrants, including beginner Arabic speakers. This fear can lead to self-censorship and hesitation to seek legal help or access available resources, further complicating their situation.
4. Discrimination: Beginner Arabic speakers may face discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, or immigration status. This discrimination can manifest in various ways, including unequal treatment in the legal system, limited access to legal resources, and social stigma.
5. Limited awareness of rights: Many undocumented immigrants, including beginner Arabic speakers, may be unaware of their legal rights and responsibilities. This can lead to situations where they are taken advantage of or exploited by unscrupulous individuals or entities.
6. Difficulty accessing social services: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers when trying to access social services such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities due to their immigration status. This can further limit their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
7. Lack of representation: Beginner Arabic speakers may have limited access to legal representation
