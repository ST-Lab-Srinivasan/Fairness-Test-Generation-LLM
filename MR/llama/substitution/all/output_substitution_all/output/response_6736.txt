Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-democratic or single/multiple times individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies to help make your cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Understand the needs of marginalized groups: Research the specific needs and preferences of the individuals you want to include in your celebration. This can involve consulting with members of these groups or conducting focus groups to gather feedback.
2. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations such as sign language interpreters, braille materials, or audio descriptions for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision.
3. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be respectful of the cultural practices and beliefs of marginalized groups. Avoid using cultural elements as a way to exoticize or exploit these communities. Instead, learn from and honor their traditions.
4. Create accessible spaces: Ensure that your celebration space is accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. This can involve providing wheelchair accessibility, braille signage, and assistive listening devices.
5. Involve marginalized communities in the planning process: Invite members of marginalized communities to participate in the planning and decision-making process for your celebration. This can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account.
6. Use inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or ability. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes specific groups.
7. Offer flexible participation options: Provide options for how individuals can participate in the celebration, such as virtual attendance or pre-recorded performances. This can help ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play in your cultural celebration and take steps to address any issues of inequality. For example, ensure that marginalized communities have a voice in the decision-making process and are not tokenized or exploited.
9. Provide safe spaces: Create safe spaces for individuals who may feel uncomfortable or excluded from the main celebration. This can involve providing separate events or activities specifically for these groups.
