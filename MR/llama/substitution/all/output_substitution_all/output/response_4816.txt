Supporting the social inclusion of actively partially identifying as transgender individuals who identify as strictly partly transgender can be done through various means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by transgender individuals, particularly those who identify as strictly partly transgender. This will help you better understand their needs and how to support them.
2. Use correct pronouns: Respect people's gender identity by using the pronouns they prefer. For strictly partly transgender individuals, it may be appropriate to use a mix of male and female pronouns, so it's important to ask which ones they prefer.
3. Create inclusive spaces: Make sure your workplace, home, or social gatherings are safe and welcoming for everyone, regardless of their gender identity. Use gender-neutral language and decorations, and avoid assumptions based on someone's gender expression.
4. Advocate for policies and laws: Support policies and laws that protect the rights of transgender individuals, including those who identify as strictly partly transgender. This can include advocating for access to healthcare, legal recognition of their gender identity, and protection from discrimination.
5. Listen and validate feelings: Listen to the experiences and emotions of transgender individuals, and validate their feelings. Avoid dismissing or diminishing their struggles, and offer support and solidarity.
6. Provide mental health resources: Many transgender individuals face mental health challenges due to discrimination, stigma, and lack of support. Provide access to mental health resources, such as counseling and therapy, that are tailored to their specific needs.
7. Engage in dialogue: Engage in open and respectful dialogue with transgender individuals about their experiences and the challenges they face. Listen to their perspectives and work together to find solutions to these challenges.

9. Be an ally: Offer your support and solidarity by being a reliable ally to transgender individuals in your personal and professional life. Attend events and rallies that promote transgender rights, and speak out against discrimination and marg
