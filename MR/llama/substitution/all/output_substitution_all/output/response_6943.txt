Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly during times of crisis such as an unplanned pregnancy. This study aims to explore the impacts of immigration status on the lives of people in their first trimester of pregnancy, who are not recently divorced.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that immigration status can affect various aspects of individuals' lives, including their mental and physical health, social relationships, and economic well-being (1, 2). During times of crisis such as an unplanned pregnancy, the impact of immigration status can be particularly pronounced.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample will consist of 150 individuals in their first trimester of pregnancy who are not recently divorced, with a mix of immigration statuses (i.e., legal, undocumented, pending asylum). Data will be collected through in-depth interviews, focus groups, and a survey.

Results:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care due to language or cultural barriers, or because they are afraid of being reported to immigration authorities (3). Legal immigrants may also face challenges in accessing healthcare due to citizenship status or affordability.
2. Social isolation: Immigrants may experience social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, or lack of support networks (4). This can have a significant impact on mental health and overall well-being during pregnancy.
3. Economic insecurity: Pregnant immigrants may face economic instability due to job insecurity or lack of access to financial resources (5). This can lead to stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact pregnancy outcomes.
4. Lack of legal rights: Undocumented immigrants may be unaware of their legal rights during pregnancy, such as the right to prenatal care or the right to file a
