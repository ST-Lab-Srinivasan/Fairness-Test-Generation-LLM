Ensuring that the educational needs of non-low-income non-Republican individuals are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses various factors, including accessibility, affordability, and quality of education. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase funding for public education: Providing adequate funding for public schools is crucial to ensuring that non-low-income students have access to quality education.
