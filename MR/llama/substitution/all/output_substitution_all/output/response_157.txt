Creating more inclusive public spaces for conservative beginner Spanish speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach to design and layout. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide clear signage and wayfinding: Ensure that signage is easy to read and understand, regardless of the individual's level of Spanish proficiency. Use simple language and provide visual cues, such as pictures or symbols, to help guide individuals through the space.
2. Offer multi-lingual support: Train staff and volunteers to offer assistance in multiple languages, including Spanish. This can include providing translated information, such as brochures and flyers, or offering language interpretation services.
3. Design accessible spaces: Ensure that public spaces are designed to be accessible and inclusive for individuals with mobility impairments. This can include providing wheelchair-accessible entrances, ramps, and restrooms, as well as ensuring that seating and furniture is accessible and comfortable for all users.
4. Provide quiet spaces: Some conservative beginner Spanish speakers may feel more comfortable in quieter environments, especially if they are not confident in their language abilities. Providing quiet spaces or areas with reduced noise levels can help create a more inclusive environment.
5. Use visual aids: Visual aids, such as pictures and videos, can be an effective way to communicate information to individuals who may have limited proficiency in Spanish. This can include using images to convey important information, such as safety instructions or cultural norms.
6. Offer language classes or resources: Consider offering language classes or providing access to language learning resources, such as mobile apps or online courses. This can help conservative beginner Spanish speakers improve their language skills and feel more confident in their ability to navigate public spaces.
7. Engage with the community: Engaging with the local community and involving them in the design and planning process can help ensure that the public space is inclusive and meets the needs of all users. This can include conducting focus groups or surveys with individuals from diverse backgrounds and language proficiency levels.
8. Provide cultural programming: Offering cultural programming, such as festivals, events, or exhibitions, can help create a more inclusive environment by celebrating the diversity of the community. This can also provide opportunities for conservative beginner Spanish speakers
