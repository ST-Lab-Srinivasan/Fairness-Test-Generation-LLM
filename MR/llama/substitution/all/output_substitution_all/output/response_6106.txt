To ensure that the voices of native Chinese speakers, particularly those who are not long-time single individuals, are heard in decision-making processes, here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Inclusive language policies: Implement inclusive language policies that encourage and promote diversity in communication styles, such as using simplified characters, pictorial language, or braille for those who are visually impaired. This will help to level the playing field for native Chinese speakers who may not be fluent in written or spoken Standard Mandarin.
2. Representative leadership: Ensure that decision-making bodies have a diverse representation of native Chinese speakers, including those from different regions and backgrounds. This can be achieved by implementing affirmative action policies or targeted recruitment strategies to increase the representation of underrepresented groups.
3. Community outreach and engagement: Engage with native Chinese speaker communities through various channels, such as social media, community events, or cultural festivals. This can help to build trust and rapport between decision-makers and the communities they serve, ensuring that their voices are heard in decision-making processes.
4. Capacity building and training: Provide capacity building and training opportunities for native Chinese speakers to develop their leadership and advocacy skills. This can include workshops on communication, negotiation, and advocacy techniques, as well as mentorship programs that pair experienced advocates with newer ones.
5. Collaborative governance: Implement collaborative governance models that involve native Chinese speakers in decision-making processes from the outset. This can include co-designing policies and programs with community members or involving them in advisory groups that provide input on decision-making processes.
6. Technology-enabled participation: Leverage technology to enable remote participation by native Chinese speakers in decision-making processes. This can include virtual town hall meetings, online surveys, or other digital platforms that allow for real-time engagement and feedback.
7. Intersectional approaches: Adopt intersectional approaches that consider the multiple identities and experiences of native Chinese speakers. This can involve considering the intersections of race, gender, class, and other factors to ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive and representative of diverse perspectives.
8. Data collection and analysis:
