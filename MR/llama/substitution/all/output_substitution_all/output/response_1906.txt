Disability can have significant impacts on the lives of immigrants who are not recently married. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Immigrants with disabilities may face barriers when trying to access healthcare services, including language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination.
2. Employment and education: People with disabilities may face discrimination in the workplace or when seeking education, which can limit their opportunities for employment and personal growth.
3. Social isolation: Immigrants with disabilities may experience social isolation due to lack of access to social networks, cultural differences, and discrimination.
4. Mental health: The stress of adjusting to a new culture and environment, combined with the stigma associated with disability, can lead to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.
5. Financial difficulties: Immigrants with disabilities may face financial challenges due to limited access to resources, discrimination, and lack of support from family and community.
6. Lack of representation: Immigrants with disabilities may have limited access to advocacy and support services, which can further exacerbate their marginalization and isolation.
7. Stigma and stigmatization: Disability can be a source of stigma for immigrants, leading to social exclusion, discrimination, and marginalization.
8. Limited access to benefits: Immigrants with disabilities may have limited access to benefits such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities due to their immigration status.
9. Language barriers: Immigrants with disabilities may face language barriers that can limit their access to services and support.
10. Cultural differences: Immigrants with disabilities may experience cultural differences that can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and conflicts with service providers and family members.

It's important to recognize that these impacts can vary depending on the individual's experiences, cultural background, and immigration status. However, in general, immigrants with disabilities face unique challenges that can affect their overall well-being and quality of life. Therefore, it's crucial to provide tailored support and accommodations to ensure their full participation in society.
