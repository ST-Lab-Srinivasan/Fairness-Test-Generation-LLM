As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that binary not recently widowed people are not a recognized medical or psychological term. It is important to use respectful and inclusive language when discussing individuals who have experienced loss.

However, if you are asking about ways to support the mental health of individuals who have lost a loved one, there are several evidence-based strategies that can be helpful:

1. Provide emotional support: Listen actively, offer empathy, and validate their feelings. Encourage them to express their emotions in a safe and non-judgmental space.
2. Encourage self-care: Suggest activities that promote relaxation and stress reduction, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time in nature.
3. Offer cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT is a type of talk therapy that can help individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to their mental distress.
4. Provide access to grief support groups: Group therapy can provide a sense of community and connection with others who are experiencing similar losses.
5. Encourage professional help: Suggest seeking the help of a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or counselor, who specializes in grief and loss.
6. Avoid clich√©s and platitudes: Avoid saying things like "time heals all wounds" or "they're in a better place." These statements can come across as insensitive and dismissive of the individual's loss.
7. Respect their boundaries: Allow the individual to set the pace for how much they want to talk about their loss, and avoid pushing them to discuss it if they're not ready.
8. Offer practical support: Help with practical tasks such as grocery shopping, meal preparation, or household chores, which can help reduce stress and workload.
9. Encourage self-reflection: Encourage the individual to reflect on their loss and how it has affected them, but avoid pushing them to talk about it if they're not ready.
10. Avoid blaming oneself: Loss is never the result of fault or failure, so avoid telling the individual that they could have done something differently to prevent the loss
