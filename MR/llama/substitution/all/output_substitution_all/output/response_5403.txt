Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Chinese speakers, especially those who are over 90 years old or advanced in age (over 85), requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use simple language and visual aids: Beginner Chinese speakers may struggle with complex language structures and vocabulary. Using simple language and incorporating visual aids, such as pictures, videos, or props, can help make the event more accessible to this group.
2. Offer multilingual support: Providing support in multiple languages can help ensure that all participants feel included and comfortable. This could involve providing translation services, or having interpreters available for those who need them.
