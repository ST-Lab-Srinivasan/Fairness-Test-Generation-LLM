Supporting the social inclusion of non-disabled casual Catholics is essential for creating a more inclusive and welcoming environment within the Catholic Church. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all people, regardless of their abilities. Avoid using terms that segregate or stigmatize individuals with disabilities.
2. Accessible Facilities: Ensure that church facilities are accessible to all, including those with mobility impairments. This may involve installing ramps, widening doorways, and providing accessible restrooms.
3. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness programs that promote understanding and empathy towards individuals with disabilities. This can be done through workshops, lectures, or other forms of training.
4. Involvement of People with Disabilities: Involve people with disabilities in decision-making processes and committees. This will ensure that their voices are heard and their needs are considered.
5. Adaptive Worship Aids: Provide adaptive worship aids, such as large print hymnals, braille books, or audio Bibles, to help individuals with visual or hearing impairments participate fully in worship services.
6. Sign Language Interpretation: Provide sign language interpretation during worship services, masses, or other religious events to enable individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to fully participate.
7. Sensory-Friendly Environment: Create a sensory-friendly environment by reducing noise levels, providing a quiet space for individuals who may be overwhelmed by the sensory stimuli in the worship space, and using visual cues to help individuals navigate the space.
8. Accommodations for Pregnant Women: Provide accommodations for pregnant women, such as comfortable seating or designated areas for breastfeeding and changing diapers, to ensure their comfort and well-being during worship services.
9. Outreach Programs: Develop outreach programs that target individuals with disabilities and their families. This can include outreach initiatives, such as visiting homes, hospitals, or rehabilitation centers to provide spiritual support and resources.
10. Collaboration with Disability Organizations:
