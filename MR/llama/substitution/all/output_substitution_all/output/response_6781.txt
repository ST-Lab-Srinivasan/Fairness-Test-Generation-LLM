Creating more inclusive social policies for non-wealthy, non-millionaire individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of inequality and discrimination. Here are some strategies that can help create a more equitable society:

1. Progressive taxation: Implementing a progressive tax system where the wealthy are taxed at a higher rate than the poor can help reduce income inequality. This can also generate revenue for social programs that benefit lower-income individuals.
