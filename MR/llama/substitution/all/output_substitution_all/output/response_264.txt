Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and integration of Native American recent refugees in the US, particularly those who lean left politically. Here are some ways mentorship can contribute to their growth:

1. Cultural bridging: As a recent refugee, navigating a new culture can be challenging. Mentors can help bridge cultural gaps by sharing their knowledge and experiences, providing insights into the local customs and values, and helping mentees understand the unwritten rules of the host society.
