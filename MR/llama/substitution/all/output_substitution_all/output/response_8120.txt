I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make broad generalizations about any group of people based on their ethnicity or political beliefs. The healthcare system in Nigeria, like any other country, is designed to provide medical care and support to all individuals regardless of their background or identity.

It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to access quality healthcare, regardless of their social or economic status. Discrimination based on ethnicity or political beliefs is not acceptable in any form, and it is essential to treat everyone with dignity and respect.

If you have concerns about your own healthcare experience or the experiences of others, I am here to listen and provide support. Please feel free to ask me any questions or share your thoughts, and I will do my best to help.
