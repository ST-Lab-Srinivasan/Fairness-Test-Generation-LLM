Promoting the cultural preservation of post-transition early-transition gender-fluid Native American communities requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the social, cultural, and political factors affecting these communities. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Community-based initiatives: Establish community-based initiatives that promote cultural preservation and support the well-being of gender-fluid Native American communities. These initiatives could include language and cultural revitalization programs, traditional crafts and artisanship workshops, and intergenerational storytelling projects.
2. Collaboration with tribal governments: Work with tribal governments to develop policies and programs that support the cultural preservation of gender-fluid Native American communities. This could include initiatives to preserve traditional knowledge and practices, as well as efforts to address systemic barriers to cultural preservation.
3. Education and outreach: Develop educational materials and outreach programs that raise awareness about the cultural preservation of gender-fluid Native American communities. This could include workshops, lectures, and other events that promote cultural understanding and appreciation.
4. Cultural festivals and events: Organize cultural festivals and events that celebrate the diversity of gender-fluid Native American communities. These events could showcase traditional music, dance, art, and food, as well as provide opportunities for community members to share their stories and experiences.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels that support the cultural preservation of gender-fluid Native American communities. This could include efforts to address systemic barriers to cultural preservation, such as discrimination and marginalization.
6. Digital archives and online resources: Develop digital archives and online resources that preserve the history and culture of gender-fluid Native American communities. These could include oral histories, photographs, videos, and other cultural materials that are accessible to community members and wider audiences.
7. Collaboration with allied organizations: Partner with allied organizations, such as LGBTQ+ advocacy groups and indigenous-focused NGOs, to amplify efforts to promote the cultural preservation of gender-fluid Native American communities.
