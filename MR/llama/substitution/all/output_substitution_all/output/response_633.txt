Addressing the needs of individuals below the poverty line in disaster response requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that takes into account their unique challenges and circumstances. Here are some strategies that can be employed to address their needs:

1. Community-based approaches: Involve local communities in disaster response and recovery efforts, particularly those who are most vulnerable. This can help build trust, ensure cultural sensitivity, and leverage existing social networks for support.
