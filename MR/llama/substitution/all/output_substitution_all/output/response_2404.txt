1. Limited access to healthcare: Many non-upper-class ethnic minorities face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of insurance, or limited availability of healthcare providers in their area.
2. Language barriers: Non-English speakers may encounter difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
