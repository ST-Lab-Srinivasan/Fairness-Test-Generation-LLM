Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mixed Caribbean strong Christians requires an understanding of the diverse cultural and religious practices within the region. Here are some suggestions:

1. Research and learn about the various cultures and religions present in the Caribbean: As a starting point, researchers can read books, watch documentaries, or engage with local communities to learn more about the different cultures and religions present in the Caribbean. This will help create a better understanding of the diverse cultural practices and beliefs within the region.
2. Involve local communities in the planning process: Inclusive celebrations require active participation from all members of the community, including those who may feel excluded or marginalized.

5. Develop culturally sensitive programming: Programming for cultural celebrations should be developed with sensitivity towards the diverse cultural practices present in the Caribbean. This could involve avoiding programming that reinforces dominant cultural norms or promotes a single, homogeneous culture.
