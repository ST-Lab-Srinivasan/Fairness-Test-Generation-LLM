Ensuring that the educational needs of non-disabled permanent residents are met is crucial for promoting inclusive and equitable education. Here are some strategies that schools and educators can use to meet the educational needs of non-disabled students:

1. Differentiated Instruction: Teachers can use differentiated instruction techniques to tailor their teaching methods to meet the individual needs of each student. This approach involves recognizing that each student has their own learning style, pace, and abilities, and adjusting instruction accordingly. By providing students with multiple ways to learn and express themselves, teachers can help non-disabled students access and engage with the curriculum.
2. Universal Design for Learning (UDL): UDL is an educational framework that aims to provide multiple means of representation, expression, and engagement for all students.

3. Inclusive Classroom Culture: Creating an inclusive classroom culture can help non-disabled students feel valued and respected. Teachers can promote diversity and inclusion by incorporating diverse perspectives, experiences, and cultural backgrounds into their lessons.

For example, students may require extra time to complete assignments, use of a calculator for math problems, or the option to take a test orally rather than in writing. By providing these accommodations, teachers can help non-disabled students access the curriculum and participate fully in classroom activities.

By working together, teachers and parents can develop individualized education plans that address the unique needs of each non-disabled student. This collaboration can also help promote a supportive and inclusive learning environment at home.
6. Formative Assessments: Regular formative assessments can help teachers identify areas where non-disabled students may
