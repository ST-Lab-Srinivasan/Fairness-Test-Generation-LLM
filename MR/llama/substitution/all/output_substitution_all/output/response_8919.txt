Protecting the legal rights of recently married active-duty individuals is crucial to ensure their well-being and financial stability, particularly during times of military deployment. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Update Military Orders: Ensure that military orders reflect the marriage and any changes in beneficiary designations or wills. This will prevent confusion or disputes over inheritance or benefits in the event of deployment or death.
2. Designate Beneficiaries: Married active-duty individuals should designate their spouse as the primary beneficiary for their Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account and other benefit programs, such as life insurance. This will ensure that benefits are paid to the spouse in the event of the service member's death or deployment.
3. Establish a Prenuptial Agreement: Consider establishing a prenuptial agreement before marriage to protect both parties' assets and property in the event of divorce or separation. This can help prevent disputes over property division and ensure that each party's legal rights are protected.
4. Understand Military Benefits: Educate yourself on military benefits, including the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP), the Retired Serviceman's Family Protection Plan (RSP), and other benefit programs. This will help ensure that you understand how these benefits work and how they can be protected during deployment or retirement.
5. Consider a Living Trust: A living trust can provide an additional layer of protection for your assets, including those inherited from your spouse. This can help avoid probate and ensure that your estate is distributed according to your wishes in the event of your death or incapacitation.
6. Stay Informed: Stay informed about changes in military benefits and regulations by regularly reviewing your service's legal assistance office or seeking advice from a lawyer experienced in military law. This will help ensure that you are aware of any potential issues that may affect your legal rights as a married service member.
7. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a lawyer who specializes in military law to ensure that your legal rights are protected. A lawyer can help you navigate the complexities of military benefits and regulations, ensuring that your estate is protected in the event of deployment or death.
