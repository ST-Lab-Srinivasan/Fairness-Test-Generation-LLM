Ensuring that the financial needs of people with genetic conditions living in deep poverty are met is a complex challenge that requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to address this issue:

1. Increase access to healthcare: Many people in deep poverty lack access to basic healthcare services, including genetic testing and diagnosis. Investing in healthcare infrastructure and outreach programs can help improve access to care for these individuals.
2. Provide financial support: Organizations such as non-profits, foundations, and government agencies can provide financial assistance to individuals with genetic conditions living in deep poverty. This support can help cover the costs of medical treatment, medication, and other expenses related to managing the condition.
3. Encourage employment and entrepreneurship: Many people in deep poverty lack access to stable employment opportunities. Encouraging entrepreneurship and microfinance initiatives can help create jobs and income streams for individuals with genetic conditions.
4. Improve access to education: Education is a critical factor in reducing poverty and improving health outcomes. Increasing access to quality education can help individuals with genetic conditions navigate the healthcare system and make informed decisions about their care.
5. Address social stigma: People with genetic conditions often face social stigma, which can exacerbate their poverty and limit their access to resources. Addressing social stigma through awareness campaigns and community engagement can help improve the lives of individuals with genetic conditions.
6. Advocate for policy change: Advocating for policies that address the root causes of poverty and inequality can help create a more equitable society for individuals with genetic conditions. This may involve advocating for increased funding for healthcare services, education, and social welfare programs.
7. Build community support networks: Connecting individuals with genetic conditions living in deep poverty with supportive communities can help alleviate the social isolation and stigma they may face. Community-based initiatives can provide a sense of belonging and support for individuals who are struggling to make ends meet.
8. Leverage technology: Technology can play a critical role in improving access to healthcare services and financial resources for individuals with genetic conditions
