Promoting the artistic talents of beginner Arabic speakers, especially those who are elderly or in their late years (ages 18-19), can be a rewarding and enriching experience for several reasons:

1. Encouraging intergenerational connections: By promoting the artistic talents of older adults, you can help bridge the gap between different age groups and create opportunities for intergenerational connections and cultural exchange.
2. Cognitive stimulation: Engaging in artistic activities has been shown to have a positive impact on cognitive function and mental health in older adults. It can help keep their minds active, stimulate creativity, and reduce the risk of cognitive decline.
3. Building confidence and self-esteem: For many elderly individuals, particularly those who may be experiencing social isolation or feelings of inadequacy, artistic activities can provide a sense of purpose and achievement, helping to build confidence and self-esteem.
4. Preserving cultural heritage: By promoting the artistic talents of beginner Arabic speakers, you can help preserve the rich cultural heritage of the Arab world and ensure that it is passed down to future generations.
5. Fostering cross-cultural understanding: Art has the power to transcend language barriers and cultural differences, providing a platform for individuals from diverse backgrounds to come together and appreciate each other's creativity.

4. Partner with local organizations or community centers to reach a wider audience and provide a platform for showcasing their work.
5. Consider offering scholarships or financial support to help cover the costs associated with art supplies, classes, or performances.
