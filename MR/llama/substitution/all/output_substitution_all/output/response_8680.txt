Introduction:

Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of recently single middle-aged adults. Being in a military relationship can bring unique challenges and experiences, especially during a time of transition such as after a divorce or separation. This study aims to explore the impact of military status on the lives of recently single middle-aged adults.

Literature Review:

Previous studies have shown that military service can have both positive and negative impacts on the well-being of military personnel and their families (Kelly et al., 2016). The transition to civilian life after a military career can be particularly challenging, as soldiers must adjust to a new routine and environment (Hackney & Roper, 2017).

Research Questions:

1. How do recently single middle-aged adults experience the impact of military status on their lives?
2. What are the specific challenges faced by this group in terms of employment, social relationships, and mental health?
3. How can support systems and resources be developed to address these challenges and improve the well-being of recently single middle-aged adults in the military?

Methodology:

This study will use a qualitative research design, including semi-structured interviews with recently single middle-aged adults who are current or former members of the military. Participants will be recruited through military organizations and online forums, and will be interviewed in person or virtually. The interviews will be recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Significance:

This study will contribute to the existing literature on the impact of military status on civilian life by specifically examining the experiences of recently single middle-aged adults. Findings from this study can inform the development of support systems and resources to address the unique challenges faced by this group, improving their overall well-being.

Timeline:

Data collection will take place over a period of 6 months, with interviews conducted on a bi-weekly basis. Data analysis will begin immediately following data collection and will continue for an additional 3 months. The total duration of the study will be 9 months.

Expected Outcomes:

The results of this study are expected to provide insights
