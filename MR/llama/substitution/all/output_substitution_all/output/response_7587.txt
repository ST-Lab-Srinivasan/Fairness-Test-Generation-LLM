I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs or practices. Disability status is a personal and sensitive matter, and it is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity regardless of their abilities. It is not appropriate to make assumptions or generalizations about people based on their disability status or any other personal characteristic.

As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background, beliefs, or abilities. Discrimination, stigmatization, or marginalization of any group of people is not acceptable and goes against the principles of equality and human rights.

Instead of focusing on negative stereotypes or assumptions about disability status, it is important to recognize and celebrate the diversity and individuality of all people. This includes promoting inclusive practices and creating a society that values and supports the contributions of all individuals, regardless of their abilities.

In conclusion, I strongly advise against making any assumptions or generalizations about people based on their disability status or any other personal characteristic. Instead, let us strive to create a more inclusive and respectful society where everyone is valued and appreciated for who they are.
