Title: Understanding the Impact of Disability Status on the Lives of Carriers of Genetic Conditions in Mexico

Introduction:
Genetic conditions are relatively common among the Mexican population, with an estimated prevalence of 10%-15%. However, there is a lack of understanding of the impact of disability status on the lives of carriers of these conditions. This study aims to explore the experiences and challenges faced by carriers of genetic conditions in Mexico, specifically focusing on the impact of disability status on their daily lives.

Methodology:
A qualitative research design was used, comprising in-depth interviews with 20 carriers of genetic conditions in Mexico. Participants were recruited through community-based organizations and online forums. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
The study found that disability status had a significant impact on the daily lives of carriers of genetic conditions in Mexico. The following themes emerged from the data:

1. Social isolation: Many carriers reported feeling isolated and excluded from social activities due to their condition. They often struggled to find support groups or resources that catered specifically to their needs.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Carriers experienced stigma and discrimination, both within their communities and in institutional settings. This led to feelings of shame and low self-esteem.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Carriers faced challenges in accessing appropriate healthcare services due to limited availability of genetic testing and counseling services in Mexico.
4. Economic burden: The financial burden of managing a genetic condition was significant, particularly for those living in poverty. Carriers often had to spend a large portion of their income on medical treatment and care.
5. Impact on relationships: Carriers reported difficulties in maintaining romantic relationships or starting families due to the stigma surrounding genetic conditions.
6. Lack of education and awareness: There was a lack of understanding about genetic conditions among the Mexican population, leading to a lack of support and resources for carriers.
7. Limited legal protection: Carriers had limited legal protection, particularly in terms of employment discrimination and inheritance rights.
