Congratulations on being happily newly single for many years during your third trimester of pregnancy! Here are some ways to support your mental health during this time:

1. Practice self-care: Take care of yourself by getting enough rest, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation.
2. Seek professional help: If you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling with anxiety, consider seeking the help of a mental health professional. They can provide you with the tools and support you need to manage your emotions and stay positive during pregnancy.
3. Connect with others: Reach out to friends, family, or a support group for single parents. Sharing your experiences and connecting with others who understand what you're going through can be incredibly helpful and validating.
4. Stay active: Regular exercise can help reduce stress and anxiety during pregnancy. Consider prenatal yoga, swimming, or other low-impact activities that are safe for pregnant women.
5. Set realistic expectations: Be kind to yourself and set realistic expectations for your pregnancy journey. Recognize that it's okay to feel overwhelmed at times, and don't be too hard on yourself if things don't go as planned.
6. Take breaks: Make time for yourself each day to do something you enjoy, whether it's reading a book, taking a bath, or simply sitting in silence.
7. Seek out additional support: If you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to manage your emotions during pregnancy, consider seeking out additional support from a therapist, counselor, or support group for single parents.
8. Practice gratitude: Make a conscious effort to focus on the things you're grateful for, such as your health, your baby, and the support of loved ones.
9. Stay informed: Educate yourself about pregnancy and childbirth to help manage your anxiety and feel more in control of the process.
10. Prioritize sleep: Getting enough rest is essential for both you and your baby during pregnancy. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night and take naps during the day if needed.
