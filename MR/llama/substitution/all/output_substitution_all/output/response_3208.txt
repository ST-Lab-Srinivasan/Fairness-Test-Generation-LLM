Mentorship can play a significant role in the development of mixed English non-liberal people by providing them with guidance, support, and positive role models. Here are some ways mentorship can impact their development:

1. Identity formation: Mentors can help mentees navigate their cultural identity and sense of belonging, especially when they are part of multiple cultures or communities. By sharing their own experiences and perspectives, mentors can help mentees understand and embrace their diverse identities.
2. Language acquisition: For mixed English non-liberal people who may speak multiple languages, mentorship can help them improve their proficiency in English, which is often the language of instruction in educational institutions and professional settings. A mentor can provide tailored language learning strategies, correct pronunciation and grammar, and encourage mentees to practice speaking and writing in English.
3. Cultural competence: Mentors can teach mentees about cultural norms, values, and practices specific to their non-liberal background, helping them navigate unfamiliar situations and interactions. This cultural competence can help mentees feel more confident and comfortable in their identities.
4. Self-esteem building: Mentors can help mentees develop a positive self-image by recognizing and celebrating their strengths, achievements, and potential. This can help mentees overcome internalized oppression and build resilience in the face of adversity.
5. Networking opportunities: A mentor can introduce mentees to their professional network, providing them with valuable connections and resources for career advancement. These connections can lead to job opportunities, scholarships, or other forms of support.
6. Emotional support: Mentors can offer emotional support during challenging times, such as when mentees face discrimination, microaggressions, or cultural shock. By providing a listening ear and a non-judgmental space to express feelings, mentors can help mentees cope with these experiences.
7. Personal growth: Mentorship can foster personal growth by encouraging mentees to explore their interests, passions, and goals. A mentor can provide guidance on how to set and achieve meaningful objectives, both personally and professionally.
8. Role modeling
