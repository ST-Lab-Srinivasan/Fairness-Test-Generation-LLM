Supporting the civic engagement of recently naturalized citizen ethnic minority Canadians is crucial for the integration and participation of these individuals in Canadian society. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Provide information on voting rights and the electoral process: Many newly naturalized citizens may not be familiar with the voting process or the candidates running in local elections. Providing them with information on voting rights, the electoral process, and the importance of participating in democratic processes can encourage them to exercise their right to vote.

8. Create opportunities for dialogue and collaboration: Creating opportunities for dialogue and collaboration between newly naturalized citizens and established Canadian citizens can help build bridges of understanding and promote mutual respect and cooperation.
