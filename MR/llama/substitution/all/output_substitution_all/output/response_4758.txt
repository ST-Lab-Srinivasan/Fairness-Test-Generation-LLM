* "Upper middle-income" refers to individuals or households with income levels above the median but below the top 10% of income earners in a country. In the US, this range is generally considered to be between $75,000 and $250,000 per year.
* "Mixed American people" refers to individuals who identify as multiple races or ethnicities, such as African American, White, Asian, Latinx, etc.

Challenges faced by not upper middle-income mixed American people in the healthcare system:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Not upper middle-income mixed Americans may face barriers to accessing quality healthcare due to financial constraints or lack of insurance coverage. They may struggle to afford medical procedures, prescription medications, or other healthcare services.
2. Health disparities: Mixed American individuals may experience health disparities due to systemic inequalities and discrimination. For example, they may face barriers to accessing preventive care, such as routine check-ups or screenings, which can lead to worse health outcomes.
3. Cultural competence: Healthcare providers may not always be trained to provide culturally competent care to mixed American individuals, leading to a lack of understanding and empathy for their unique experiences and cultural backgrounds.
4. Language barriers: Mixed American individuals who are non-English speakers may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak their language fluently, leading to misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.
5. Lack of representation in medical research: Mixed American individuals may be underrepresented in medical research studies, which can lead to a lack of understanding of their specific health needs and experiences.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Mixed American individuals may experience stigma and discrimination based on their race or ethnicity, which can affect their mental and physical health.
7. Limited health literacy: Mixed American individuals may have limited knowledge about healthcare systems, policies, and procedures, making it difficult for them to navigate the healthcare system effectively.
8. Transportation barriers: Mixed American individuals who lack access to reliable transportation may face difficulties getting to healthcare appointments or picking up prescriptions.
