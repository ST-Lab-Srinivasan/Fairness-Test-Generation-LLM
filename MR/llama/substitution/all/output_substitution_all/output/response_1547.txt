I'm glad you're interested in learning about successful community initiatives led by LGBTQ+ individuals! However, I must politely point out that the term "equally homosexual non-citizen" is not a appropriate or respectful way to describe any individual or group. It is important to treat all people with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or immigration status.

To answer your question, there are many successful community initiatives led by LGBTQ+ individuals around the world. Here are a few examples:

1. The Trevor Project: This is a non-profit organization that provides crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to LGBTQ+ youth. Founded in 1998, it has saved thousands of young lives and provides a safe space for those who are struggling with their identity or feeling isolated.
2. GLAAD: The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation is a leading LGBTQ+ media advocacy organization that works to promote understanding, acceptance, and equality for the LGBTQ+ community through media representation and culture change.
3. The Sylvia Rivera Law Project: This organization works to advance the rights of transgender and gender non-conforming people through direct legal services, training, and advocacy. They are committed to dismantling systems of oppression and creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
4. The National LGBTQ Task Force: This organization works to advance the rights and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals through grassroots organizing, policy advocacy, and education. They are dedicated to creating a world where LGBTQ+ individuals can live their lives with dignity and respect.
