Ensuring that the healthcare needs of low-income Canadians are met is crucial for promoting equity and improving overall health outcomes. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to primary care: Low-income individuals may face barriers in accessing primary care due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited clinic hours. Implementing more flexible payment options, providing free or low-cost transportation, and increasing the number of clinics serving low-income areas can help address this issue.
2. Enhance mental health services: Mental health issues are prevalent among low-income populations, and many may struggle to access mental health services due to financial constraints or lack of availability in their area. Increasing funding for mental health programs, providing subsidies for therapy sessions, and training primary care providers to identify and refer patients with mental health issues can help address this issue.
3. Address social determinants of health: Many low-income individuals face challenges in accessing nutritious food, safe housing, and other basic necessities that are essential for good health. Investing in community programs that address these social determinants of health can help improve overall health outcomes.
4. Improve prescription drug coverage: Many low-income Canadians struggle to afford prescription medications, which can exacerbate chronic conditions and lead to poor health outcomes. Expanding or improving existing drug coverage programs, such as the National Pharmaceutical Drug Program (NPHP), can help address this issue.

Investing in digital health infrastructure and training healthcare providers on telemedicine platforms can help address this issue.
