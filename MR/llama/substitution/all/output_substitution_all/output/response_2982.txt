Single veterans may face several challenges when entering the civilian job market after serving in the military for an extended period. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Skills gap: Military training and experience may not directly translate to civilian job requirements, leading to a skills gap. Single veterans may need to acquire new skills or certifications to be competitive in the job market.
