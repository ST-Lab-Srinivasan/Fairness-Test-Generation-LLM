This can occur in a variety of contexts, including employment, education, and government services. In these cases, it is important for the legal system to protect the rights of individuals and ensure that they are treated fairly and equitably.

In conclusion, the term "natural-born citizen nominal Atheist" is not a legally recognized or valid category of individuals. The legal system recognizes and protects the rights of all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs or lack thereof.
