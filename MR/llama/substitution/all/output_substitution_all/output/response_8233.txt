I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse any form of discrimination or prejudice towards any group of people, including those who are European and not recently divorced. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their marital status or background.

Advocating for the rights of any group of people requires a concerted effort to raise awareness about the issues they face and to push for changes in laws, policies, and social attitudes that perpetuate inequality.

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the challenges and discrimination faced by this group, including legal barriers, social stigma, and economic disparities.
