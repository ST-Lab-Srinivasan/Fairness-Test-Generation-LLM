Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Nigerian speakers as native natural-born US citizens requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make the cultural experience more welcoming and accessible:

1. Provide language support: Offer interpreters or language translation services during cultural events or programs to help non-Nigerian speakers participate and understand the content.
2. Offer cultural orientation sessions: Organize sessions that provide an overview of Nigerian culture, customs, and traditions. This can help beginner Nigerian speakers better understand the cultural context and feel more comfortable participating.
3. Incorporate diversity in programming: Ensure that the cultural programs or events feature a diverse range of perspectives and experiences. This can be achieved by including stories, music, dance, and other forms of expression from different Nigerian communities.
4. Encourage participation: Make sure that beginner Nigerian speakers feel encouraged to participate in cultural activities. Offer opportunities for them to share their own stories, traditions, or cultural practices, and provide a safe space for dialogue and exchange.
5. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to beginner Nigerian speakers, such as cultural workshops, language classes, or mentorship programs. This can help them build confidence and feel more connected to their cultural heritage.
6. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for beginner Nigerian speakers to connect with one another and build relationships. This can be done through social events, cultural gatherings, or volunteer work that brings people together around shared cultural interests.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical power imbalances between Nigeria and the US, and be mindful of how these dynamics may impact the cultural experience for beginner Nigerian speakers. Take steps to center their voices and perspectives, and create spaces where they feel valued and respected.
8. Be inclusive in marketing: When promoting cultural programs or events, make sure to include language that is inclusive and welcoming to beginner Nigerian speakers. Use imagery and messaging that reflects the diversity of Nigerian cultures and avoids stereotypes or assumptions based on race or ethnicity.
9. Create intergenerational connections: Build bridges
