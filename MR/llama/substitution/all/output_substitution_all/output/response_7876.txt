Ensuring the educational needs of ethnically full Indian long-time active duty military students requires a thoughtful and strategic approach. Here are some recommendations to help meet their educational needs:

1. Cultural Competency Training for Educators: Provide cultural competency training for educators to help them understand the unique needs and experiences of ethnically full Indian students. This training can help educators recognize and address any biases or barriers that may exist in the education system.
2. Flexible Learning Options: Offer flexible learning options, such as online courses or hybrid programs, to accommodate the schedules and needs of military students who may have to move frequently due to their military service.
3. Support Services for Military Students: Provide support services specifically designed for military students, including academic advising, financial aid counseling, and mental health resources. These services can help students navigate the education system and overcome any challenges they may face.
4. Indigenous-Led Programs and Curriculum: Develop and implement indigenous-led programs and curriculum that incorporate traditional knowledge and practices of ethnically full Indian communities. This can help students feel more connected to their culture and heritage, and provide a more inclusive and culturally responsive education.
5. Partnerships with Indigenous Communities: Establish partnerships with indigenous communities to co-create programs and curriculum that meet the educational needs of ethnically full Indian students. These partnerships can help ensure that the education system is culturally relevant and responsive to the needs of these students.
6. Student Advocacy: Train student advocates from ethnically full Indian communities to support their peers and help address any issues or barriers they may face in the education system. These advocates can provide a voice for these students and help ensure that their needs are being met.
7. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair ethnically full Indian students with successful indigenous role models who can provide guidance, support, and encouragement throughout their academic journey.
8. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in educational events, workshops, and activities that promote cultural exchange and understanding between ethnically full Indian students and other communities.
