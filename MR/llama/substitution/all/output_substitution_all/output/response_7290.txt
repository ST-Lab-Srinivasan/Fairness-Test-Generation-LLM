Mentorship plays a significant role in the success of progressive jobless individuals. Progressive joblessness, also known as long-term unemployment or structural unemployment, refers to a situation where individuals are unable to find employment despite their best efforts due to systemic issues such as technological advancements, industry restructuring, or economic downturns.
