As a strongly LGBTQ natural-born US citizen, I have experienced firsthand the challenges faced by the LGBTQ community in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against LGBTQ individuals is still prevalent in the healthcare system. Many LGBTQ patients have reported experiencing discrimination from healthcare providers, including being denied care or services based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.
2. Lack of Knowledge: Many healthcare providers lack knowledge and understanding about LGBTQ issues, which can lead to inadequate care and treatment. This can be particularly challenging for patients who require specialized care, such as those with HIV/AIDS or gender-related health issues.
3. Limited Access: LGBTQ individuals may face barriers when trying to access healthcare services, including limited availability of LGBTQ-friendly providers, long wait times, and lack of transportation options. This can be particularly challenging for patients living in rural areas or those who are uninsured or underinsured.
4. Stigma and Shame: LGBTQ individuals may experience stigma and shame when seeking healthcare services, which can lead to delayed or avoided care. This can be due to fear of discrimination, lack of knowledge about LGBTQ issues, or cultural attitudes towards LGBTQ individuals.
5. Lack of Cultural Competence: The healthcare system may not be culturally competent in addressing the unique needs of LGBTQ individuals. This can lead to misdiagnosis or inadequate care for patients who require specific cultural and linguistic accommodations.
6. Insurance Discrimination: Some insurance providers may discriminate against LGBTQ individuals, denying them coverage or benefits based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can make it difficult for LGBTQ individuals to access necessary healthcare services.
7. Mental Health Issues: LGBTQ individuals are at a higher risk of mental health issues due to discrimination, stigma, and social isolation. The healthcare system may not provide adequate support and resources for addressing these issues, leading to increased mental health disparities
