Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for late 30s beginner English speakers involves understanding their needs and preferences, as well as being sensitive to the cultural differences that may exist. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural celebrations:

1. Use simple language and explanations: Avoid using complex language or jargon that may be difficult for beginner English speakers to understand. Instead, use simple language and provide clear explanations of cultural practices and traditions.
2. Provide visual aids: Using images, videos, or other visual aids can help beginners understand cultural practices better. For example, you could show pictures of traditional clothing, food, or rituals to help them visualize the culture.
3. Offer interactive experiences: Encourage participants to participate in interactive activities, such as singing, dancing, or playing traditional music. This can help them connect with the culture on a deeper level and have fun at the same time.
4. Be sensitive to cultural differences: Recognize that each person's cultural background is unique, and be respectful of their individual experiences and beliefs. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's cultural identity.
5. Involve participants in planning: Encourage participants to contribute to the planning process for cultural celebrations. This can help them feel more invested in the event and more likely to participate.
6. Provide opportunities for questions and discussions: Create a safe space for participants to ask questions and engage in discussions about cultural practices and traditions. This can help build understanding and foster a sense of community.
7. Offer multilingual support: If you have participants who speak different languages, provide translators or interpreters to ensure everyone can understand the content being presented.
8. Be mindful of accessibility: Ensure that the venue and activities are accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. This can involve providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
9. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of cultures represented at the celebration and encourage participants to share their own cultural practices and traditions.
10. Follow local customs and laws: Be respectful of local customs and laws when planning cultural celebrations
