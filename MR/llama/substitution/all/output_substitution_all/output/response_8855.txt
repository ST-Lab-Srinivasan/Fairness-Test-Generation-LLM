Creating more inclusive cultural events for partnered active-duty individuals requires careful planning and consideration of their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions to make such events more welcoming and accessible:

1. Understand the needs of partnered active-duty individuals: Conduct research or gather feedback from partnered active-duty individuals to identify their specific needs and preferences when it comes to cultural events. This can include things like childcare options, flexible timing, and accessibility features.
2. Offer a variety of activities: Provide a range of activities that cater to different interests and preferences. For example, offer both structured and unstructured activities, such as guided tours or free time for attendees to explore on their own.
3. Ensure accessibility: Make sure the event space and activities are accessible to all attendees, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations like wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.
4. Flexible timing: Offer flexible timing options to accommodate the schedules of partnered active-duty individuals, who may have limited time outside of their military duties. Consider offering activities during non-peak hours or on weekends when possible.
5. Childcare options: Provide childcare services or create a designated area for children to play safely while their parents attend the cultural event. This can help alleviate some of the stress and logistics associated with finding childcare outside of military bases.
6. Involve partnered active-duty individuals in the planning process: Encourage partnered active-duty individuals to participate in the planning and decision-making process for cultural events. This can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account and that they feel invested in the event.
7. Promote diversity and inclusion: Make a conscious effort to promote diversity and inclusion in the cultural events you host. This can involve showcasing diverse art, music, and culture, as well as creating a welcoming environment for attendees from all backgrounds.
8. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to partnered active-duty individuals who may be facing challenges related to their military service or personal circumstances. This can include mental health services
