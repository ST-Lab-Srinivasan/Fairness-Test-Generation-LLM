To ensure that the voices of native French speakers who are recent refugees to the US are heard in decision-making processes, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Create a platform for their voices to be heard: Organizations such as non-profits or community groups can provide a space for these individuals to share their experiences and perspectives. This can be done through workshops, focus groups, or other forms of engagement.
