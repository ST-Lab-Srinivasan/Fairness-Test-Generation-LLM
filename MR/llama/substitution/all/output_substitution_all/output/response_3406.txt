As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide information and suggestions on how to create more inclusive social policies for unmarried green card holder individuals based on available data and research. Here are some possible ways:

1. Addressing Lack of Access to Healthcare: Many unmarried green card holders face challenges in accessing healthcare due to their immigration status. Policymakers can work towards expanding Medicaid eligibility for low-income individuals, regardless of their immigration status. This can be achieved by advocating for legislation that provides access to affordable healthcare for all individuals, including those who are unmarried and hold a green card.
2. Promoting Financial Inclusion: Unmarried green card holders may face financial challenges due to their immigration status. Policymakers can work towards promoting financial inclusion by advocating for policies that provide access to affordable bank accounts, loans, and other financial services. This can be achieved by encouraging financial institutions to offer products and services tailored to the needs of unmarried green card holders.
3. Supporting Education and Career Advancement: Unmarried green card holders may face challenges in advancing their careers due to their immigration status. Policymakers can work towards supporting education and career advancement by advocating for policies that provide access to affordable higher education and job training programs. This can be achieved by increasing funding for programs that support the education and career development of unmarried green card holders.
4. Addressing Discrimination and Bias: Unmarried green card holders may face discrimination and bias due to their immigration status. Policymakers can work towards addressing these issues by advocating for policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. This can be achieved by implementing anti-bias training programs for government employees and private sector actors, as well as increasing funding for organizations that support marginalized communities.
5. Encouraging Family Reunification: Unmarried green card holders may face challenges in reunifying with their families due to complex and lengthy family-based immigration processes. Policymakers can work towards simplifying these processes by advocating for reforms that prioritize family unity
