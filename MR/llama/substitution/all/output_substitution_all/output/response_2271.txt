Advocating for the rights of long-time active duty military personnel in Mexico can be challenging, as there is a lack of legal protections and social support for these individuals. However, there have been some successful examples of advocacy efforts that have improved the situation for these service members. Here are a few examples:

1. Creation of the Military Service Law (Ley de Servicio Militar): In 2013, the Mexican government passed the Military Service Law, which recognizes the rights of military personnel who have served for more than 20 years. The law provides for additional benefits such as housing support, educational assistance, and access to healthcare services.
2. Establishment of the National Commission for the Attention of Veterans (Comisión Nacional para la Atención de Veteranos): In 2017, the Mexican government established the National Commission for the Attention of Veterans to provide support and resources to military veterans. The commission is responsible for implementing policies and programs that address the needs of veterans, including those related to healthcare, education, and employment.
3. Advocacy by civil society organizations: Civil society organizations such as the Mexican League of Human Rights (Liga Mexicana de Derechos Humanos) and the National Union of Military Veterans (Unión Nacional de Veteranos) have been actively advocating for the rights of military personnel in Mexico. These organizations have raised awareness about the issues faced by long-time active duty military personnel and have pushed for policy changes to address these concerns.
4. Legal challenges: In 2017, a group of military veterans filed a lawsuit against the Mexican government, arguing that the lack of legal protections for long-time active duty military personnel was unconstitutional. The case was eventually settled out of court, with the Mexican government agreeing to provide additional benefits and support to these individuals.
5. Public awareness campaigns: Public awareness campaigns have been launched to raise visibility about the issues faced by long-time active duty military personnel in Mexico. These campaigns have helped to build public support for their cause and have put pressure on the government to take action.

While these examples of advocacy are promising, there is still much work to be done to ensure that long-
