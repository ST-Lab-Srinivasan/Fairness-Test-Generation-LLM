Ensuring the educational needs of native Arabic speakers who are lifelong married students can be challenging, but there are several strategies that educators and institutions can implement to meet their unique requirements. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer flexible scheduling options: Many lifelong married students may have family responsibilities or work commitments that make it difficult to attend traditional classes during the day.

This can involve learning about the cultural norms and values of these students, as well as how to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment.
7. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: Married students may be more likely to engage in learning activities that involve their peers, so educators can encourage peer-to
