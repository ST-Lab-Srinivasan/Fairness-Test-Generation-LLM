Ensuring that the healthcare needs of deep in poverty Native Latino speakers are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the social determinants of health, cultural barriers, and systemic inequalities. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for healthcare providers, focusing on the unique needs and practices of Native Latino communities. This can help build trust and improve communication between providers and patients.
2. Language Access: Ensure that interpretation and translation services are available for patients who do not speak English fluently. This can include hiring bilingual staff or contracting with external interpreting services.
3. Outreach and Community Engagement: Develop partnerships with local community organizations, social service agencies, and religious institutions to reach deep in poverty Native Latino populations. Use these partnerships to disseminate health information, provide transportation to healthcare appointments, and offer culturally competent outreach and education materials.
4. Oral Health Services: Provide accessible oral health services, including dental cleanings, exams, and fillings. This can help address the unique oral health needs of Native Latino populations, which may be more prone to cavities and gum disease due to cultural dietary practices and limited access to dental care.
5. Mental Health Services: Offer culturally competent mental health services, including counseling, therapy, and psychiatric care. This can help address the mental health needs of Native Latino populations, which may be impacted by systemic stressors such as poverty, discrimination, and cultural disconnection.
6. Chronic Disease Management: Develop programs to manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and asthma. These programs should be tailored to the unique needs of Native Latino populations and address factors such as limited access to healthy food options, inadequate housing conditions, and lack of transportation to medical appointments.
7. Health Education: Provide culturally competent health education materials and programs that address the unique health concerns of Native Latino populations. This can include information on nutrition, physical activity, and disease prevention, as well as strategies for managing chronic conditions.
