The military status of a country can have significant impacts on the lives of native Arabic speakers who are not liberals. Here are some potential effects:

1. Restrictions on freedom of speech and assembly: In authoritarian or semi-authoritarian countries, there may be strict limitations on the ability of native Arabic speakers to express their opinions freely, assemble peacefully, or engage in political activism. This can limit their ability to participate fully in public life and to advocate for their rights and interests.
2. Political marginalization: In countries with limited political freedoms, native Arabic speakers may find themselves excluded from decision-making processes and power structures. This can result in a lack of representation and voice for these individuals and communities, which can further marginalize them within their own societies.
3. Economic inequality: Military regimes often prioritize the interests of the ruling elite over those of the broader population, including native Arabic speakers. This can result in unequal distribution of resources, limited economic opportunities, and increased poverty and inequality.
4. Social stigma: In some cases, military status can lead to social stigma or discrimination against native Arabic speakers, particularly if they are perceived as being associated with the ruling elite or if they are seen as opposing the military regime. This can further marginalize these individuals and limit their opportunities for social advancement.
5. Limited access to education and cultural expression: Military regimes may restrict the availability of educational resources, including language instruction, which can limit the ability of native Arabic speakers to develop their language skills or to express themselves culturally. Similarly, military regimes may suppress cultural expressions that are deemed subversive or critical of the regime, further limiting the ability of these individuals to engage in cultural activities and to express themselves authentically.
6. Psychological impacts: Living under a military regime can have significant psychological impacts on native Arabic speakers, including stress, anxiety, and feelings of powerlessness. These impacts can be particularly pronounced if the individual or their loved ones have experienced violence, repression, or other forms of mistreatment at the hands of the military regime.
