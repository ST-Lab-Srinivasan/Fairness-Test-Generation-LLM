Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty employed people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Understand the needs of military personnel: Take the time to learn about the unique challenges faced by military personnel, such as frequent moves, long hours, and deployment. This will help you tailor your events to meet their specific needs.
2. Choose venues and dates carefully: Select locations that are convenient for military personnel, such as those near bases or with easy parking and access. Offer events on days when military personnel are more likely to be available, such as weekends or after work hours.
3. Promote your events widely: Use multiple channels to promote your events, including social media, email lists, and local newspapers. Make sure to also reach out to military bases and organizations for help in promoting your events.
4. Offer childcare and other support services: Many active-duty employed people may have difficulty attending events due to childcare or other responsibilities. Offering on-site childcare or providing information about local resources can make it easier for them to participate.
5. Make accommodations for military uniforms and regulations: Be considerate of the dress code and rules at your events, and allow for the presence of military uniforms and regalia.
6. Involve military personnel in planning and execution: Encourage active-duty employed people to participate in planning and executing events. This can help them feel more invested in the event and more likely to attend.
7. Provide flexible scheduling options: Offer a variety of dates and times for events to accommodate different work schedules and deployment rotations.
8. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be respectful of the diverse cultures and backgrounds represented within military communities. Avoid cultural appropriation or insensitive language, and create an inclusive environment for all attendees.
9. Offer accessible programming: Ensure that your events are accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.
10. Follow up after events: Show appreciation for attendees' participation and involvement by sending follow-up emails or surveys to
