Ensuring the healthcare needs of deep in poverty recent refugees to Canada is crucial for their overall well-being and ability to integrate into Canadian society. Here are some strategies that can help meet their healthcare needs:

1. Access to Health Services: Ensure that recent refugees have access to primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare services, including emergency medical care, maternal and child health services, mental health services, and specialized care for chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer.
2. Language Support: Provide language support services, such as interpreters or translated health materials, to help recent refugees communicate effectively with healthcare providers.
3. Cultural Competence: Ensure that healthcare providers are culturally competent and aware of the unique needs and practices of the refugee population. This can involve providing cultural sensitivity training for healthcare staff, as well as incorporating traditional healing practices into healthcare services where appropriate.
4. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to raise awareness about available healthcare services and promote early detection and prevention of health problems. This can involve partnering with local community organizations, religious groups, and social service agencies to reach refugees where they live and worship.
5. Integration into Healthcare Systems: Facilitate the integration of recent refugees into Canada's healthcare systems by providing information about available services, including how to access them and how to navigate the system. This can involve creating patient navigation programs or providing personalized support to help refugees navigate the healthcare system.
6. Addressing Trauma: Recognize that many recent refugees have experienced trauma and provide targeted interventions to address this. This can involve providing mental health services, such as counseling and psychotherapy, as well as incorporating trauma-informed care practices into healthcare services.
7. Addressing Social Determinants of Health: Recognize that social determinants of health, such as housing, food security, and income, can have a significant impact on the health of recent refugees. Work to address these determinants by providing information and referral services to help refugees access basic needs such as affordable housing, nutritious food, and employment opportunities.
