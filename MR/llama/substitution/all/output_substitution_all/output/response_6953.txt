As a beginner European speaker and lifelong widow, there are several challenges that you may face in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of experience and skills: As a beginner European speaker, you may not have the necessary experience and skills to compete with other candidates who have been in the industry for longer.
2. Limited networking opportunities: As a widow, you may have limited opportunities to network and make connections in the industry, which can make it harder to find job opportunities.
3. Ageism: Unfortunately, ageism is still prevalent in many industries, and as a beginner European speaker who is also older, you may face discrimination based on your age.
4. Gender bias: As a woman, you may face gender bias in the job market, particularly if you are applying for roles that are traditionally seen as male-dominated.
5. Limited access to resources: As a beginner European speaker, you may not have access to the same resources and opportunities as more established speakers, such as professional development opportunities, mentorship programs, and networking events.
6. Lack of recognition: As a beginner European speaker, you may not have received the recognition that you deserve for your skills and expertise, which can make it harder to find job opportunities.
7. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the industry and location, there may be limited job opportunities available for beginner European speakers, particularly if they are in a niche or emerging field.
8. Difficulty in finding the right fit: As a beginner European speaker, you may find it challenging to find a job that aligns with your skills and interests, particularly if you are unsure of what roles are available or how to position yourself in the job market.
9. Limited language skills: If you are not fluent in the local language of the country you are applying for work in, you may face challenges in finding job opportunities, particularly if the language is a barrier to communication and understanding.
10. Cultural differences: As a beginner European speaker, you may face cultural differences in the job market, particularly if you are moving to a new country or region. Understanding the local culture and customs can help you navigate these challenges more effectively.
