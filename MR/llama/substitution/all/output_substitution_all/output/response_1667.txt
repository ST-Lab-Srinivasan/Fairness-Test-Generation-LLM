Promoting the economic empowerment of native French speaker monastic Muslim communities requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses their unique challenges and opportunities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building programs for the monastics in areas such as entrepreneurship, financial management, and business planning. This will enable them to develop skills and knowledge necessary to start and run their own businesses.
2. Access to Finance: Facilitate access to finance by providing microfinance facilities, grants, or loans at preferential rates. This will help the monastics to invest in their business ideas and grow their income-generating activities.
3. Business Mentorship: Pair the monastics with experienced business mentors who can provide guidance on how to navigate the challenges of starting and running a business. This will help them avoid common mistakes and capitalize on opportunities.
4. Networking Opportunities: Organize networking events and conferences that bring together monastics, entrepreneurs, investors, and other stakeholders. This will provide opportunities for the monastics to learn from each other's experiences and build relationships with potential partners and investors.
5. Access to Markets: Help the monastics access new markets and customers by providing them with market research and analysis, as well as introductions to potential clients. This will help them grow their customer base and increase their revenues.
6. Advocacy and Policy Engagement: Advocate for policies that promote the economic empowerment of native French speaker monastic Muslim communities. This can include advocating for access to education, training, and financial services, as well as pushing for policy reforms that support the growth of their businesses.
7. Community Development: Support community development initiatives that promote economic empowerment among the monastics. This can include providing infrastructure support, such as access to clean water and electricity, as well as promoting social and cultural activities that foster a sense of community and cooperation.
8. Interfaith Dialogue: Facilitate interfaith dialogue and collaboration between the monastics and other religious communities. This can help promote mutual understanding and respect, as well as build bridges between different faith groups.
