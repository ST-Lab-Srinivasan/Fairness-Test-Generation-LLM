Highlighting the issues faced by undocumented immigrants, including those who are not yet above the poverty line, is crucial to bring attention to their struggles and advocate for policies that address their needs. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on these issues:

1. Poverty rates: Use data to illustrate the poverty rates among undocumented immigrants compared to the general population. According to a 2019 report by the Center for American Progress, 47% of undocumented immigrants live in poverty, compared to 13% of U.S.-born citizens.
