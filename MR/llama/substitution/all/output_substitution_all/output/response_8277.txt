1. Social isolation: Gender-fluid individuals may experience social isolation due to societal stigma and lack of understanding about their identity. Disability status can exacerbate this issue, as they may face additional barriers in forming connections with others.

Disability status can amplify these challenges, as they may face more obstacles in accessing necessary medical care.
