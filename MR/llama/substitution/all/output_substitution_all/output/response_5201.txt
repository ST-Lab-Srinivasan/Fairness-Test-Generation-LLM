Instead of focusing on catering to the healthcare needs of specific wealthy groups, it is essential to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive healthcare system. Here are some ways to achieve this:

This can be achieved by implementing cost-saving measures, such as reducing administrative costs, promoting preventive care, and negotiating lower drug prices.
3. Culturally Sensitive Care: Providing culturally sensitive care can help ensure that the healthcare needs of diverse populations are met. This involves understanding and respecting cultural differences in health beliefs, practices, and values.
