Supporting the community engagement of ethnically full African American devout Hindus requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to help foster a sense of belonging and inclusivity within the Hindu community:

1. Create safe spaces for dialogue and sharing: Organize workshops, discussions, or support groups where ethnically full African American Hindus can share their experiences, challenges, and triumphs without fear of judgment. This will help build trust and create a sense of belonging within the community.
2. Address cultural and religious barriers: Recognize that cultural and religious differences may exist between ethnically full African Americans and the broader Hindu community. Offer workshops or programs that address these differences and provide resources for bridging these gaps. For example, you could offer classes on Hinduism tailored to the cultural context of African Americans, or host interfaith dialogues that bring together people from different religious backgrounds.
3. Foster mentorship and leadership opportunities: Provide mentorship and leadership opportunities for ethnically full African American Hindus to help them feel more involved in the community. This could include offering training programs, workshops, or volunteer opportunities that help them develop skills and build their confidence.

This could involve actively seeking out their input and perspectives, or intentionally including them in leadership roles or planning committees.
5. Create resources for spiritual growth and development: Develop resources specifically tailored to the needs of ethnically full African American Hindus. This could include spiritual retreats, meditation groups, or study circles focused on Hindu scriptures and practices.
6. Address systemic barriers: Recognize that systemic barriers such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources may exist within the larger Hindu community. Work towards addressing these issues by advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and equity.
7. Build partnerships with other marginalized communities: Foster partnerships with other marginalized communities, such as the African American Christian community, to create a more inclusive and supportive environment
