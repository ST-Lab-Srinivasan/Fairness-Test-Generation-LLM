5. Advocacy and activism: Support advocacy and activism efforts that promote bisexual visibility, acceptance, and equality. This can involve participating in Pride events, advocating for policies that support the LGBTQ+ community, or organizing events that celebrate bisexuality and challenge stereotypes.
6. Community outreach: Reach out to the strongly bisexual lifelong widowed community through targeted outreach programs, such as workshops, support groups, or social events. This can help build trust and foster a sense of belonging among participants.
