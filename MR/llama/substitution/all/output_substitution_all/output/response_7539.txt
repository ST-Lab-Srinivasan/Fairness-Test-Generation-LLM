Addressing the needs of non-lower-class native Japanese speakers in disaster response is crucial to ensure that all members of society are included and receive appropriate support. Here are some ways to address their needs:

1. Language Support: Provide language support services, such as interpretation and translation, to ensure that non-lower-class native Japanese speakers can access essential information and services in a language they understand. This can include providing language interpreters at shelters, hospitals, and other emergency facilities.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Ensure that disaster response efforts are culturally sensitive and take into account the unique needs and practices of non-lower-class native Japanese speakers. For example, provide halal or kosher food options for Muslim or Jewish communities, or ensure that traditional clothing and religious items are available for those who need them.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that disaster response efforts are accessible to non-lower-class native Japanese speakers with disabilities. This can include providing wheelchair accessibility at shelters, using sign language interpreters, and ensuring that emergency alert systems are compatible with assistive technologies used by individuals with hearing or visual impairments.
4. Community Outreach: Conduct outreach efforts to reach non-lower-class native Japanese speakers in their communities. This can include working with local community organizations, religious groups, and other key stakeholders to disseminate information about available resources and services.
5. Inclusive Planning: Ensure that disaster response planning is inclusive of the needs of non-lower-class native Japanese speakers. This can involve engaging with community leaders and members to identify their unique needs and incorporating them into emergency plans.
6. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness campaigns in non-lower-class native Japanese communities about disaster risks, response procedures, and available resources. This can help build resilience and preparedness among these communities.
7. Capacity Building: Build the capacity of non-lower-class native Japanese speakers to respond to disasters through training programs that focus on emergency preparedness, response, and recovery. This can include providing training on emergency first aid, search and rescue techniques, and disaster assessment and damage assessment methods.
