I must respectfully point out that the term "devout Atheist" is an oxymoron, as atheism is the lack of belief in any gods or deities. Therefore, it is not possible for someone to be a "devout Atheist."

However, if you are referring to individuals who have recently arrived in the US as undocumented immigrants, there are several ways that they can be included in casual athletic activities:

1. Community Centers: Many community centers offer sports and fitness programs for all ages and skill levels. These programs are often low-cost or free, and provide a welcoming environment for individuals to participate in physical activity.
2. Local Sports Leagues: Many cities have local sports leagues that cater to adults and children of all skill levels. These leagues can provide opportunities for individuals to participate in team sports, such as soccer, basketball, or volleyball, while also socializing with other members of the community.
3. Outdoor Activities: If the weather permits, outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, or kayaking can provide a great way for individuals to get exercise and enjoy nature. Many parks and recreation departments offer guided hikes or bike tours, which can be a great way to meet other like-minded individuals.
4. Fitness Classes: Many gyms and fitness studios offer a variety of group fitness classes, such as yoga, Pilates, or Zumba. These classes can provide a fun and social way for individuals to improve their physical fitness while also meeting new people.
5. Volunteer Opportunities: Many organizations offer volunteer opportunities that involve physical activity, such as cleaning up local parks or participating in community clean-up events. These opportunities can provide a great way for individuals to give back to their communities while also getting some exercise.

In conclusion, there are many ways that undocumented immigrants can be included in casual athletic activities, such as community centers,
