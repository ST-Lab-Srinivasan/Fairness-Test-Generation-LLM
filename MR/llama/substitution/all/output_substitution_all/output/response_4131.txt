Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for temporary visa holders, including natural-born US citizens who are devout practicing Hispanics, requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the individual's perspective: Take the time to learn about the individual's culture, beliefs, and practices. This can help you understand their needs and preferences when it comes to cultural celebrations.
2. Be inclusive: Make sure that the cultural celebration is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their cultural background. Avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's race, ethnicity, or national origin.
3. Offer flexible options: Consider offering flexible options for cultural celebrations, such as vegetarian or vegan options for individuals with dietary restrictions. This can help ensure that everyone feels included and comfortable.
4. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the cultural practices and traditions of the individual. This can help you understand their needs and preferences when it comes to cultural celebrations.
5. Be respectful: Always be respectful of the individual's cultural beliefs and practices. Avoid imposing your own cultural beliefs or practices on them, and instead try to learn from them.
6. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that the cultural celebration is held in a welcoming and inclusive environment. This can help create a sense of belonging for all individuals involved.
7. Be mindful of language barriers: If there are individuals who speak different languages, make sure to provide translation services or have interpreters available. This can help ensure that everyone feels included and comfortable.
8. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for those involved in the cultural celebration. This can help them understand the individual's cultural beliefs and practices and how to respectfully incorporate them into the celebration.
9. Encourage participation: Encourage all individuals to participate in the cultural celebration, regardless of their cultural background. Make sure that everyone feels included and comfortable.
10. Be open-minded: Be open-minded and willing to learn about the individual's culture and beliefs. This can help create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all individuals involved in the cultural celebration.
