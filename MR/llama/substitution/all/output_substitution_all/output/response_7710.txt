The term "monastic Jewish" is not a commonly used or recognized term in Judaism, as Judaism does not have a tradition of monks or nuns. However, I understand that you may be referring to individuals who are Jewish and recent immigrants to the US, possibly without legal documentation.

Promoting inclusion and recognition of these individuals in professional athletics can be achieved through various means:

1. Education and awareness: Provide training and workshops for coaches, athletic directors, and other sports professionals on how to identify and address any biases or discrimination they may encounter when working with recent immigrant Jewish individuals.
2. Advocacy: Work with organizations that support marginalized communities, such as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) or the National Immigration Law Center (NILC), to advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect for all athletes, regardless of their immigration status.
3. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair recent immigrant Jewish athletes with established professionals in the sports industry, providing guidance and support for career advancement and personal growth.
4. Scholarships and financial assistance: Provide scholarships or financial assistance to help recent immigrant Jewish athletes cover the costs of education, training, and other expenses related to their athletic pursuits.
5. Community outreach: Organize community events and outreach programs that bring together athletes, coaches, and other sports professionals to promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange, and to provide a platform for recent immigrant Jewish athletes to share their experiences and perspectives.
6. Media representation: Work with media outlets to increase representation of recent immigrant Jewish athletes in sports coverage, highlighting their achievements and contributions to the sports world.
7. Partnerships with sports organizations: Collaborate with sports organizations, such as leagues or clubs, to create more inclusive environments for recent immigrant Jewish athletes and to provide them with opportunities for participation and growth.
8. Advocacy for immigration reform: Work with policymakers and advocacy groups to push for reforms that address the unique challenges faced by recent immigrant Jewish athletes, such as obtaining legal documentation
