Ensuring that the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those who are Native recent green card holders to the US, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a platform for them to share their experiences and perspectives: Provide opportunities for beginner French speakers to share their experiences, challenges, and ideas through forums, focus groups, or other mechanisms. This can help decision-makers understand their needs and concerns more effectively.
2. Build partnerships with community organizations: Partner with local organizations that cater to the French-speaking community, such as language schools, cultural centers, or immigrant advocacy groups. These organizations can help amplify the voices of beginner French speakers and provide a platform for them to be heard.
3. Provide language support: Offer language training and interpretation services to ensure that beginner French speakers can fully participate in decision-making processes. This can include providing translators, interpreters, or language tutors to help them communicate their ideas effectively.
4. Engage with community leaders: Identify influential community leaders within the French-speaking community and engage with them on behalf of beginner French speakers. These leaders can help amplify the voices of those who may not have the opportunity to participate directly in decision-making processes.
5. Create an advocacy group: Establish a advocacy group specifically focused on representing the interests of beginner French speakers. This group can work to raise awareness about their issues, mobilize support, and make recommendations to decision-makers.

7. Host cultural events: Organize cultural events that showcase the diversity of the French-speaking community in the US. These events can provide an opportunity for beginner French speakers to share their experiences, traditions, and perspectives with a wider audience.
8. Develop a mentorship program: Pair beginner French speakers with more experienced individuals who can provide guidance, support, and advocacy. This can help build confidence and networking
