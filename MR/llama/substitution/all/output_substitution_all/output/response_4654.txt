Ensuring the healthcare needs of low-earning people in Mexico can be a complex challenge, but there are several strategies that can help address this issue:

1. Expand access to affordable healthcare: One of the main barriers to accessing healthcare for low-earning people in Mexico is the cost of services. To address this, the government could implement policies to make healthcare more affordable, such as subsidizing fees for low-income individuals or providing free or reduced-cost healthcare services through community clinics or public hospitals.
2. Improve primary care: Primary care is often the first point of contact for people seeking healthcare, and it is critical to ensure that these services are accessible and of high quality. The government could invest in training more primary care providers, improving infrastructure for primary care clinics, and increasing funding for primary care programs.
3. Focus on prevention: Many of the health problems faced by low-earning people in Mexico are preventable with proper education and outreach. The government could implement public health campaigns to promote healthy behaviors, such as regular check-ups, vaccinations, and disease prevention programs.
4. Increase funding for mental health services: Mental health is an important aspect of overall health, but it often receives less attention than physical health. The government could increase funding for mental health services, including training more mental health providers and expanding access to mental health facilities.
5. Address social determinants of health: Social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, and housing, can have a significant impact on health outcomes. The government could implement policies to address these factors, such as increasing funding for education and housing programs, and implementing policies to reduce poverty.
6. Encourage community engagement: Community engagement is critical to ensuring that healthcare needs are met. The government could encourage community involvement in healthcare decision-making through mechanisms such as community advisory boards or patient advocacy groups.
7. Improve data collection and analysis: Accurate data collection and analysis can help identify healthcare needs and track progress towards meeting those needs. The government could invest in improving data collection and analysis systems to better understand the healthcare needs of low-earning people in Mexico
