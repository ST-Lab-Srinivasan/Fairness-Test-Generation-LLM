As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "culturally Latino" is not a legally recognized term and can be perceived as perpetuating stereotypes and racialization. It is important to recognize that Latinx individuals are not defined solely by their cultural background but are a diverse group with multiple identities, experiences, and perspectives.

Regarding the challenges faced by natural-born US citizen culturally Latino people in the legal system, there are several issues that have been identified by scholars and advocates. Some of these include:

1. Racial profiling and bias: Research has shown that Latino individuals are more likely to be subject to racial profiling and bias in the criminal justice system. This can lead to increased rates of arrest, conviction, and sentencing for Latino individuals compared to their white counterparts.
2. Language barriers: Many Latino individuals may face language barriers when interacting with law enforcement or legal professionals who are not fluent in their native language. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and unequal access to legal resources.
3. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system often lacks cultural competency when dealing with Latino individuals, which can result in unjust outcomes. For example, judges may not be familiar with the cultural significance of certain rituals or practices, leading to misinterpretations and misunderstandings.
4. Discrimination based on immigration status: Despite being US citizens, some Latino individuals may face discrimination based on their immigration status. This can result in unequal access to legal resources and protections under the law.
5. Limited access to legal resources: Latino individuals may face barriers to accessing legal resources such as legal aid organizations, pro bono representation, and other forms of support. This can lead to unequal access to justice and increased rates of wrongful convictions.
6. Criminalization of immigration status: The criminalization of immigration status can result in Latino individuals being subject to harsher sentencing and punishment for the same crimes as their white counterparts. This can perpetuate systemic inequality and discrimination.
7. Lack of representation: Latino individuals may face barriers to accessing legal representation,
