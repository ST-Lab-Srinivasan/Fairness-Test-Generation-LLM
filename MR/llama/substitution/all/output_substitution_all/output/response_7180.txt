I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or marginalization based on someone's sexual orientation. Everyone should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Regarding the benefits of having diverse perspectives, it is important to recognize that asexuality is a legitimate and valid sexual orientation. Asexual people face unique challenges and experiences, and their perspectives can bring valuable insights to any discussion or community. By listening to and learning from asexual people, we can gain a better understanding of their experiences and work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting society for everyone.

In addition, it is important to recognize that sexuality exists on a spectrum, and that many people do not fit neatly into the categories of "asexual" or "sexual." Many people may identify as somewhere in between, or may experience changes in their sexual desires and preferences over time. By recognizing and respecting this diversity, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting society for everyone.

Ultimately, the benefits of having diverse perspectives from strongly asexual recently married people (or any other group) is that it allows us to learn from and appreciate the unique experiences and viewpoints of others, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and accepting society for everyone.
