Promoting the artistic expression of culturally Indian beginner Arabic speakers can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a supportive environment: Beginner Arabic speakers may feel hesitant to express themselves creatively due to language barriers or cultural differences. By creating a supportive and inclusive environment, you can encourage them to explore their artistic side.
