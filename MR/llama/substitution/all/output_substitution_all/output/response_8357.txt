Introduction:
Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of ethnically full Indian adults over the age of 90. As this population grows, it is essential to understand the factors that contribute to their well-being and quality of life. In this study, we aim to investigate the role of mentorship in the development of middle-aged (over 85) ethnically full Indian adults.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. The sample size will consist of 160 participants, recruited through purposive sampling, who are middle-aged (over 85) ethnically full Indian adults. Data will be collected through semi-structured interviews, surveys, and observations.

Results:
Our findings suggest that mentorship plays a crucial role in the development of middle-aged ethnically full Indian adults. Participants reported that mentorship helped them navigate cultural and social barriers, build self-esteem and confidence, and develop a sense of purpose and direction in life. Mentors provided emotional support, guidance, and role models for participants to emulate.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the importance of mentorship in the development of middle-aged ethnically full Indian adults. Mentorship can help build self-esteem, confidence, and a sense of purpose in life, which are essential for overall well-being and quality of life. This study underscores the need for culturally sensitive mentorship programs tailored to the specific needs of this population.

Recommendations:
Based on our findings, we recommend the following:

1. Culturally sensitive mentorship programs that cater specifically to the needs of middle-aged ethnically full Indian adults.
2. Training and capacity building for mentors to better understand the cultural nuances and challenges faced by this population.
3. Increased accessibility and availability of mentorship programs, particularly in underserved communities.
4. Evaluation and monitoring of mentorship programs to ensure their effectiveness and impact on participants' well-being.

By implementing these recommendations, we can enhance
