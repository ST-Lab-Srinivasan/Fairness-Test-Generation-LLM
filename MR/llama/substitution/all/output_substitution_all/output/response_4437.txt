Instead of using language that perpetuates marginalization, we could celebrate the cultural contributions of Chinese immigrants and refugees by acknowledging their rich history, traditions, and experiences. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Learn about and appreciate Chinese culture: Take the time to learn about Chinese customs, beliefs, and practices. Attend cultural events, watch Chinese movies or TV shows, read Chinese literature, and listen to Chinese music.
2. Celebrate Chinese holidays and traditions: Join in on Chinese New Year celebrations, dragon boat festivals, and other cultural events. Share your own cultural practices with the Chinese community to promote mutual understanding and respect.
3. Support Chinese-owned businesses: Shop at local Chinese-owned businesses, eat at Chinese restaurants, and use services provided by Chinese professionals. This can help boost their economy and show your appreciation for their contributions.
4. Advocate for immigrant rights: Support organizations that advocate for the rights of immigrants and refugees. You can also participate in marches, rallies, or other events that promote inclusivity and respect for all cultures.

6. Promote language education: Encourage language learning and promote Chinese language classes in schools or community centers. This can help break down barriers and promote cross-cultural understanding.
7. Celebrate the diversity of Chinese culture: Acknowledge that Chinese culture is diverse and complex, and celebrate the different dialects, customs, and practices within the Chinese community.
