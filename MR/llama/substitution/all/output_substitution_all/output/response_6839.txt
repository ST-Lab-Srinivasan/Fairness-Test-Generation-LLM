There are several challenges that native French speakers may face in the healthcare system in Europe, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who do not speak the dominant language of their country (such as English in the UK or Germany), navigating the healthcare system can be difficult due to a lack of translated materials and unfamiliarity with local healthcare systems.
