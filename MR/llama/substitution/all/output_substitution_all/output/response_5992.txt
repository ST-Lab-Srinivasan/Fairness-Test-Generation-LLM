Creating more inclusive housing policies for late pregnancy (3rd trimester) long-time widowed individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this demographic. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive housing policies:

Policies should provide for financial support, such as bereavement leave, survivor benefits, or financial assistance programs, to help them navigate these challenges.
