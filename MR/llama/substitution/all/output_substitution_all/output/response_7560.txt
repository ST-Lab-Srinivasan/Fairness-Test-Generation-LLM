As a beginner Chinese speaker who is recently divorced, there are several challenges you may face in the job market. Here are some of them:

1. Language barrier: As a beginner Chinese speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively in a professional setting, especially if you are working with native Chinese speakers. This can lead to difficulties in expressing yourself clearly, understanding instructions and feedback, and building relationships with colleagues and clients.
2. Limited experience: If you have recently divorced and started learning Chinese, you may lack the work experience that is typically expected by employers. This can make it harder for you to compete with other job applicants who have more extensive work histories.
3. Lack of confidence: Going through a divorce can be emotionally challenging, and this may affect your confidence in the job market. You may feel hesitant or unsure of yourself when it comes to job hunting, interviews, and professional networking.
4. Limited job opportunities: Depending on where you live and the current job market conditions, there may be limited job opportunities available for beginner Chinese speakers. This can make it harder for you to find a job that matches your skills and qualifications.
5. Stereotypes and biases: Unfortunately, there are still many stereotypes and biases against older or divorced workers in the job market. As a result, you may face discrimination or prejudice when looking for a job, particularly if you are applying to traditional corporate settings.
6. Difficulty balancing work and personal life: As a beginner Chinese speaker who is recently divorced, you may find it challenging to balance your work and personal life, especially if you have children or other family responsibilities. This can lead to stress and burnout if not managed properly.
7. Limited access to resources: Depending on where you live and the availability of resources, you may face challenges in accessing language learning materials, cultural events, and job search tools that can help you advance your career.
8. Difficulty navigating a new culture: If you are moving to a new location for work, you may find it challenging to navigate a new cultural environment, particularly if you are not familiar with the local customs and practices. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications in the workplace.
