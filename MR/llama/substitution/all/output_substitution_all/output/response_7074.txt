Ensuring the educational needs of African American child students can be achieved through a variety of strategies and practices. Here are some key recommendations:

1. Culturally Relevant Curriculum: Develop and implement culturally relevant curricula that reflect the experiences, histories, and cultural backgrounds of African American students. This can help increase their sense of belonging and engagement in school.
2. Diverse Teaching Staff: Ensure that there is a diverse teaching staff that includes African American educators. Research has shown that students learn better when they see themselves represented in the teaching staff.
3. Identity-Based Education: Provide education that helps students understand their own identities and cultures, as well as those of others. This can help foster empathy, inclusivity, and respect for diversity.
4. Address Systemic Inequality: Address systemic inequalities within the educational system, such as funding disparities and resource allocation. Ensure that all schools have access to the same resources and opportunities.
5. Family and Community Involvement: Encourage family and community involvement in education. This can help students feel more connected to their school and educators, and can provide additional support for their academic success.
6. Addressing Implicit Bias: Provide training for teachers and staff on implicit bias and cultural responsiveness. This can help them recognize and address any biases that may affect student outcomes.
7. Restorative Justice Practices: Implement restorative justice practices in schools to address incidents of discrimination, harassment, or bullying. These practices focus on repairing harm and promoting healing rather than simply punishing wrongdoers.
8. Mental Health Supports: Provide mental health supports for African American students who may be experiencing trauma or stress due to systemic inequalities. This can help them better navigate the educational environment and achieve academic success.
9. Student Voice and Choice: Involve African American students in decision-making processes that affect their education. This can help them feel more invested in their education and more likely to succeed.
10. Community Partnerships: Develop partnerships with local community organizations, businesses, and institutions to provide additional resources and support for African American students. These partnerships can help bridge the gap
