Long-time active duty military personnel often face unique challenges when transitioning to civilian life and entering the job market. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Skills gap: Military training and experience may not directly translate to civilian job requirements, leading to a skills gap. This can make it difficult for veterans to find employment in their desired field.
2. Lack of civilian work experience: Many military personnel have spent most of their adult life in the military, which means they may lack experience working in a civilian environment. This can make it challenging to adapt to the pace and culture of civilian life.
3. Difficulty with networking: Military culture often emphasizes hierarchy and following orders, while civilian culture places a greater emphasis on networking and building relationships. Veterans may struggle to navigate these cultural differences in the job market.
4. Limited understanding of corporate culture: The military operates under a strict chain of command, which can be vastly different from the more relaxed atmosphere found in many civilian workplaces. Veterans may need time to adjust to the unspoken rules and expectations of corporate culture.
5. Mental health challenges: Military personnel are often exposed to traumatic events during their service, which can lead to mental health issues such as PTSD, depression, or anxiety. These challenges can make it difficult for veterans to navigate the job market and may result in them being overlooked for certain positions.
6. Ageism: Older military personnel may face age-related discrimination in the job market, particularly if they have been out of the workforce for an extended period.
7. Difficulty with transitioning to a non-traditional work schedule: Many military personnel are used to following a strict schedule and adhering to a rigid routine. Adapting to a more flexible work schedule or working non-traditional hours can be challenging for some veterans.
8. Limited access to resources: Veterans may face barriers in accessing resources such as career counseling, job fairs, and mentorship opportunities. This can make it harder for them to find employment and navigate the job market.
9. Difficulty with networking: Military personnel often have a limited network of civilian contacts
