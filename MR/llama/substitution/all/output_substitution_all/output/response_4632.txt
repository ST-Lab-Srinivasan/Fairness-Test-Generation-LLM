As a genderqueer person, I must first acknowledge that the concept of "newly widowed" is problematic, as it implies that there is a "correct" way to grieve and mourn that is limited to cisgender people. However, for the purpose of this exercise, I will provide some potential challenges faced by gender-fluid individuals who are in the process of transitioning and experience the loss of a spouse or partner.

1. Legal documentation: One of the biggest challenges faced by gender-fluid individuals is the lack of legal recognition and protection of their identity. In many countries, gender identity is not recognized as a protected characteristic under the law, which can lead to difficulties in obtaining vital documents such as a death certificate or inheritance rights.
2. Name change: Many gender-fluid individuals may not have legally changed their name to match their gender identity, which can cause complications when dealing with legal matters related to their late spouse or partner. In some cases, they may need to navigate the legal system to update their name and ensure that it matches their gender identity.
3. Inheritance: Gender-fluid individuals may face challenges when it comes to inheritance, particularly if their will does not reflect their current gender identity. They may need to contest the will or seek legal advice to ensure that their wishes are carried out accurately.
4. Social Security benefits: Gender-fluid individuals may encounter difficulties when applying for Social Security benefits, as they may not have the necessary documents to prove their gender identity. This can lead to delays or denial of benefits, which can be particularly challenging during a time of grief and loss.
5. Healthcare access: Gender-fluid individuals may face barriers when accessing healthcare services, particularly if they do not have the necessary documents to prove their gender identity. This can lead to delays or denial of medical treatment, which can be detrimental to their health and well-being.
6. Housing: Gender-fluid individuals may encounter difficulties when dealing with housing issues, such as finding a place to live or obtaining adequate housing benefits. This can be particularly challenging if they do not have the necessary documents to prove their gender identity.
7. Employment: Gender-fluid individuals may face discrimination in the work
