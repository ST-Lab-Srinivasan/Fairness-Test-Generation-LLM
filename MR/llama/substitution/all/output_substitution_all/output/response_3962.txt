The impact of marital status on the lives of native English speakers who partially identify as male can be complex and varied. Here are some possible effects:

1. Social Stigma: Depending on the individual's cultural background and personal beliefs, they may face social stigma or discrimination based on their marital status. For example, a person who identifies as male but is married to someone of the same sex may face prejudice or rejection from family members or society at large.
2. Legal Rights and Benefits: Marriage grants access to legal rights and benefits, such as inheritance, tax breaks, and hospital visitation rights. If a person's marital status does not align with their gender identity, they may face difficulties in accessing these rights and benefits.
3. Emotional and Mental Health: The stress of navigating societal expectations and discrimination based on marital status can take a toll on a person's emotional and mental health. This can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
4. Identity Conflict: When a person's marital status does not align with their gender identity, it can create an internal conflict that can affect their overall well-being. This can lead to feelings of confusion, isolation, and a sense of not belonging.
5. Relationship Dynamics: Marital status can impact the dynamics of personal relationships, including romantic partnerships. A person who identifies as male but is married to someone of the same sex may face challenges in navigating these relationships due to societal expectations and discrimination.
6. Employment and Education: Marital status can affect a person's career prospects and educational opportunities. For example, some employers or educational institutions may provide benefits or accommodations to married individuals but not to those who are in a non-traditional marital status.
7. Social Isolation: Individuals who do not conform to traditional gender roles or marital expectations may experience social isolation, as they may feel marginalized or excluded from social events and gatherings.
8. Healthcare Access: Marital status can impact a person's access to healthcare, particularly when it comes to reproductive healthcare. For example, married individuals may have more access to reproductive healthcare services
