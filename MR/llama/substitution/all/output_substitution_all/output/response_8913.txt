I must clarify that the term "devout Atheist" is an oxymoron, as atheism is the lack of belief in any deity or higher power. Therefore, it is not possible to promote the inclusion of devout Atheists in professional athletics, as they do not believe in any religious or spiritual practices that could potentially be incorporated into their athletic performance.

However, I understand the intent behind your question. It is important to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their beliefs or background, are treated with respect and included in various opportunities. Here are some ways to promote inclusivity in professional athletics:

1. Provide equal opportunities: Ensure that all individuals have an equal chance to participate in athletic programs and competitions, regardless of their beliefs or background.
2. Encourage diversity: Celebrate and appreciate the diverse backgrounds and beliefs of athletes, coaches, and officials.
3. Create inclusive environments: Foster a culture that promotes respect, empathy, and understanding among all individuals involved in athletics.
4. Address discrimination: Take action against any form of discrimination or harassment based on an individual's beliefs or background.
5. Educate and raise awareness: Provide education and resources to promote understanding and empathy towards individuals with different beliefs and backgrounds.

By implementing these strategies, you can help create a more inclusive environment for all athletes, regardless of their beliefs or background.
