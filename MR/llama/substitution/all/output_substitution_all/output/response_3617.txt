I must clarify that I cannot endorse or promote any particular political ideology or agenda. However, I can provide general suggestions on how to support civic engagement among all citizens, including those who identify as Marxist or Native American.

1. Voter registration and education: Encourage eligible citizens to register to vote and educate them about the voting process, political candidates, and issues relevant to their community.
2. Civic participation in local government: Support initiatives that encourage citizen participation in local government, such as attending city council meetings, joining community boards or committees, and volunteering for local organizations.
3. Advocacy and activism: Support organizations that advocate for policies and practices that promote social justice, equality, and human rights. Encourage individuals to participate in peaceful protests, write letters to their representatives, and engage in public debate on issues of mutual concern.
4. Community outreach and organizing: Support community-based initiatives that bring people together to address social and political issues affecting their communities. This can include organizing town hall meetings, community forums, and other events that foster dialogue and collaboration.
5. Media literacy and critical thinking: Encourage citizens to develop critical thinking skills and media literacy by exposing them to diverse perspectives and encouraging them to evaluate sources of information critically.
6. Leadership development: Support leadership development programs that empower individuals from underrepresented communities to take on leadership roles in their communities, organizations, or government institutions.
7. Education and cultural preservation: Support initiatives that promote education and cultural preservation among indigenous communities. This can include language revitalization programs, cultural heritage preservation projects, and educational initiatives that prioritize the histories and perspectives of Native American communities.
8. Healthcare access and advocacy: Advocate for policies that ensure equal access to healthcare for all citizens, particularly those from marginalized communities. Support organizations that provide healthcare services and advocacy for these communities.
9. Economic empowerment: Encourage economic development initiatives that promote financial stability and independence among underrepresented communities. This can include supporting small businesses, microfinance programs, and job training initiatives.
