The impact of military status on the lives of deeply lower-class individuals can be significant, as it often affects their socioeconomic status, access to education and job opportunities, and overall well-being. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Limited career advancement: Military service can provide career advancement opportunities, but for deeply lower-class individuals, these opportunities may be limited due to a lack of connections or resources. They may struggle to access better-paying jobs or advance in their careers after leaving the military.
2. Difficulty accessing education and training: Military service members may have access to educational and training opportunities within the military, but these opportunities may not translate into civilian job markets.
