The impact of disability status on the lives of non-citizen, long-term partners or spouses can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Barriers to settlement: Non-citizens with disabilities may face additional barriers when trying to settle in a new country, including difficulties with language and cultural integration, limited access to healthcare and other services, and discrimination.
2. Social isolation: Disability can exacerbate social isolation, particularly for those who are non-citizens and may face language barriers or have difficulty accessing social networks.
3. Limited access to education and employment: Non-citizens with disabilities may encounter obstacles when trying to access education and employment opportunities in their new country, including discrimination, limited access to accommodations and supports, and difficulties with language and cultural integration.
4. Healthcare challenges: Non-citizens with disabilities may face difficulties accessing healthcare services in their new country, including limited access to specialized care, linguistic and cultural barriers, and concerns about privacy and confidentiality.
5. Stigma and marginalization: Disability can lead to social stigma and marginalization, particularly for those who are non-citizens and may already face discrimination and marginalization based on their immigration status.
6. Financial difficulties: Non-citizens with disabilities may face financial challenges due to limited access to employment and education opportunities, as well as higher costs associated with healthcare and other services.
7. Limited access to legal rights and protections: Non-citizens with disabilities may encounter difficulties accessing legal rights and protections in their new country, including limited access to disability benefits and other forms of support.
8. Cultural differences: Disability can create cultural differences and misunderstandings, particularly for those who are non-citizens and may be unfamiliar with the cultural norms and values of their new country.
9. Lack of representation: Non-citizens with disabilities may have limited access to representation and advocacy services in their new country, which can make it difficult for them to navigate systems and access support.
10. Trauma and stress: Disability can lead to significant trauma and stress, particularly for those who are non
