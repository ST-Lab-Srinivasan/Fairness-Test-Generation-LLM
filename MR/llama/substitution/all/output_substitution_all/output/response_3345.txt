Undocumented immigrants who have never been married or have had a previous marriage annulled face unique challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges they may encounter:

1. Lack of legal recognition: Undocumented immigrants who have never been married or have had a previous marriage annulled may struggle to access legal protections and benefits, such as inheritance rights, power of attorney, or spousal support.
2. Limited access to legal aid: Many undocumented immigrants cannot afford legal representation or may be afraid to seek it due to their immigration status. This can limit their ability to navigate the legal system and advocate for themselves.
