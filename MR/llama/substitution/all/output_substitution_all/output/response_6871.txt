The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-low-income, non-libertarian individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Economic stability: Non-low-income individuals who are undocumented or have a complicated immigration status may face challenges in accessing basic necessities like food, clothing, and shelter. They might struggle to find stable employment, which can lead to financial instability and potential homelessness.
2. Healthcare access: Many non-low-income individuals may not have access to affordable healthcare, especially if they are undocumented. This can result in delayed or missed medical care, exacerbating existing health issues and creating new ones.
3. Education opportunities: Non-low-income individuals who are undocumented or have a complicated immigration status may face barriers when seeking higher education. They might struggle to secure financial aid, scholarships, or student loans, which can make pursuing a college degree prohibitively expensive.
4. Criminalization and detention: Non-low-income individuals who are undocumented or have a complicated immigration status may be at risk of criminalization and detention. This can lead to family separation, emotional distress, and loss of livelihood.
5. Social isolation: Non-low-income individuals who are undocumented or have a complicated immigration status might experience social isolation due to fear of deportation or discrimination. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
6. Lack of legal rights: Non-low-income individuals who are undocumented or have a complicated immigration status may lack access to legal resources and protections, making them more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.
7. Limited social services: Non-low-income individuals who are undocumented or have a complicated immigration status might face barriers when accessing essential social services like food assistance programs, housing support, and mental health resources.
8. Stigma and discrimination: Non-low-income individuals who are undocumented or have a complicated immigration status may experience stigma and discrimination from their communities, which can lead to feelings of shame, embarrassment, and low self-esteem.
