I must politely challenge the assumptions in your question. The concept of "natural-born European citizen ethnically full American people" is not a recognized or valid category. Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of individuals and communities around the world, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality.

Cultural heritage refers to the customs, traditions, beliefs, values, and practices that are passed down from generation to generation within a particular community or society. It encompasses a wide range of elements, including language, religion, art, literature, music, folklore, and historical sites.

For many people, cultural heritage serves as a source of identity and belonging, connecting them to their ancestors and community. It provides a sense of continuity and stability in an ever-changing world, and it can also be a source of pride and inspiration.

However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not fixed or static, but rather dynamic and evolving. It can change over time as communities adapt to new circumstances, technologies, and social and political structures.

In the case of European Americans, their cultural heritage is shaped by a complex history of colonization, immigration, and cultural exchange. While they may have a shared historical and cultural background with other European peoples, it is important to recognize that they are not a monolithic group and that their experiences and identities are diverse and multifaceted.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of individuals and communities around the world, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality. It provides a sense of identity, belonging, and continuity, while also adapting and evolving over time to reflect changing social and political contexts.
