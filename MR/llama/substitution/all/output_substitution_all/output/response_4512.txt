As an asexual person, I face several challenges in the Canadian healthcare system as a recently arrived refugee. Here are some of the difficulties I have encountered:

1. Lack of cultural sensitivity and understanding: As an asexual person from a non-Western culture, I often encounter a lack of understanding and cultural sensitivity from healthcare providers. This can lead to misinterpretation of my needs and preferences, and in some cases, inadequate care.
2. Lack of accessibility: As a refugee, I may not have access to the same healthcare resources as Canadian-born individuals. This can be particularly challenging for those who are not fluent in English or French, as language barriers can hinder communication with healthcare providers.

8. Lack of culturally sensitive resources: There may be a lack of culturally sensitive resources available for asexual refugees in
