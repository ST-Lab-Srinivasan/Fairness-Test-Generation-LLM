As a beginner English speaker or French speaker in the legal system, there are several challenges you may face. Here are some common ones:

1. Language barrier: The primary challenge for both beginner English and French speakers is the language barrier. Legal terms and concepts can be complex and difficult to understand, especially when explained in a language that is not your native tongue. This can make it hard to navigate legal procedures, understand legal documents, and communicate effectively with legal professionals.
