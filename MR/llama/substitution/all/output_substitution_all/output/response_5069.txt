Ensuring the educational needs of right-leaning culturally Nigerian students can be challenging, as it requires a nuanced approach that takes into account their cultural background and political beliefs. Here are some strategies that educators can use to meet the educational needs of these students:

1. Create an inclusive learning environment: Educators should strive to create a learning environment that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures and political beliefs. This can be achieved by promoting cross-cultural understanding, empathy, and mutual respect among students.
2. Encourage critical thinking: Right-leaning culturally Nigerian students may have strong opinions and beliefs that are shaped by their cultural background and political leanings. Educators can encourage critical thinking by encouraging students to question their assumptions, evaluate evidence, and develop well-reasoned arguments.
3. Provide opportunities for voice and choice: Students who feel that their cultural beliefs and values are not being represented in the classroom may become disengaged or disruptive. Educators can provide opportunities for voice and choice by allowing students to choose topics or issues related to their cultural background or political beliefs, and encouraging them to research and present on these topics.
4. Use diverse teaching methods: Right-leaning culturally Nigerian students may have different learning styles and preferences than their peers. Educators can use diverse teaching methods, such as storytelling, role-playing, and hands-on activities, to engage students and help them learn in ways that are tailored to their individual needs.
5. Provide cultural context: Educators can provide cultural context for the topics or issues being studied, by sharing stories, examples, or case studies that illustrate how cultural beliefs and values intersect with political and social issues. This can help students see the relevance of the subject matter to their own lives and experiences.
6. Encourage intercultural dialogue: Educators can encourage intercultural dialogue by bringing together students from different cultural backgrounds to discuss topics or issues that are relevant to them. This can help promote mutual understanding, respect, and empathy among students.
7. Address stereotypes and biases: Educators should be aware of their own biases
