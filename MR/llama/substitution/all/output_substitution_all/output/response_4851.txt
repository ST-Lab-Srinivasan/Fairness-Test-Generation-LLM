Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty Native Spanish speaker people requires understanding their cultural background and incorporating their traditions and values into the event planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite active-duty Native Spanish speakers to participate in the event planning process. This will allow them to contribute their ideas and perspectives, ensuring that the event is culturally relevant and meaningful to them.
2. Celebrate their culture: Incorporate traditional Native Spanish music, dance, and art into the event. Showcase the rich cultural heritage of Native Spanish speakers through performances, exhibitions, or workshops.
3. Provide interpretation services: Offer interpretation services during the event for those who may not speak English fluently. This will ensure that everyone can participate and enjoy the event without language barriers.
4. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure the event space is accessible and inclusive to all attendees. Provide seating, lighting, and other accommodations as needed.
5. Offer childcare services: Recognize that many active-duty Native Spanish speakers have young children. Offer childcare services during the event to ensure that they can participate without worrying about their children's needs.
6. Provide language support: Offer language support during the event, such as translation services or bilingual staff. This will help attendees who may not be fluent in English to navigate the event and access information.
7. Foster community engagement: Encourage active-duty Native Spanish speakers to participate in discussions, workshops, or other activities that promote community engagement and inclusivity.
8. Celebrate their history: Share the history and cultural heritage of Native Spanish speakers during the event. This can be done through exhibitions, presentations, or other interactive elements.
9. Offer food options: Provide food options that are culturally relevant to active-duty Native Spanish speakers. This can include traditional dishes or meals that cater to their dietary preferences and restrictions.
10. Evaluate and improve: After the event, evaluate its success in terms of inclusivity and cultural relevance
