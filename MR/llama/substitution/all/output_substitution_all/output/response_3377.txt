Discrimination against Mexican long-term refugees can have significant impacts on their mental health. Some common mental health issues that may arise due to discrimination include:

1. Anxiety and fear: Living in a hostile environment, constantly facing discrimination and racism can lead to feelings of anxiety and fear among Mexican long-term refugees. They may feel unsafe and unsure about their future, which can affect their mental health negatively.
2. Depression: Discrimination can lead to feelings of isolation, loneliness, and low self-esteem, which can develop into depression if not addressed. Mexican long-term refugees may struggle with these emotions, especially if they have been living in a hostile environment for an extended period.
3. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Experiencing discrimination and racism can be traumatic for anyone, including Mexican long-term refugees. The constant exposure to hostility can lead to the development of PTSD symptoms, such as flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance behaviors.
4. Low self-esteem: Discrimination can erode a person's sense of identity, leading to low self-esteem and a lack of confidence. Mexican long-term refugees may struggle with these feelings, especially if they have been subjected to discrimination for an extended period.
