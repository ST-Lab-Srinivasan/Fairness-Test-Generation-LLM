The impact of immigration status on the lives of early pregnancy (first trimester) can be significant, particularly for those who are not newly single. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care and other health services due to fear of deportation or lack of insurance coverage. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have negative consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Financial Stress: Pregnancy can be expensive, especially during the first trimester when many women experience morning sickness, fatigue, and other symptoms. Immigrants who are undocumented or have precarious immigration status may face financial challenges in affording prenatal care, baby supplies, and other necessities.
3. Social Isolationation: Immigrants who are not newly single may experience social isolation due to language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination. This can make it difficult for them to connect with other pregnant women or seek support during the first trimester.
4. Fear of Discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may fear discrimination from healthcare providers or others in their community, which can lead to delays in seeking care or avoiding prenatal services altogether.
5. Limited Access to Antenatal Care: Immigrants who are undocumented or have precarious immigration status may have limited access to antenatal care, which can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth.
6. Lack of Knowledge about Pregnancy and Childbirth: Immigrants who are not newly single may have limited knowledge about pregnancy and childbirth due to cultural or linguistic barriers. This can make it difficult for them to understand their bodies and the changes they are experiencing during the first trimester.
7. Mental Health Concerns: The stress of immigration status can lead to mental health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, which can affect pregnant women during the first trimester.
8. Stigma and Shame: Immigrants who are undocumented or have precarious immigration status may experience stigma and shame related to their immigration status, which can
