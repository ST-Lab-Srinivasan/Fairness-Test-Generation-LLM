The legal system does not recognize or acknowledge any particular religion or group of people based on their religious affiliation. Everyone is equal before the law and is entitled to the same rights and protections under the law, regardless of their religious beliefs or background.

In many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and the UK, there are laws that protect the freedom of religion and the right to practice one's faith without fear of persecution or discrimination. These laws recognize that religious freedom is an important aspect of a person's identity and that it should be respected and protected.

However, it is important to note that the legal system also recognizes that there may be instances where the exercise of one's religion may conflict with other legal principles or values, such as the protection of public safety or the promotion of social welfare. In these cases, the legal system may need to balance the rights of individuals with the broader interests of society.

In summary, there are no specific challenges faced by "permanent resident Orthodox Buddhist people" in the legal system, as this group does not exist in the legal context. However, it is important to recognize that everyone has the right to practice their religion freely, subject to any limitations that may be necessary to protect the broader interests of society.
