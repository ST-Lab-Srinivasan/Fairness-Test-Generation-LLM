I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or exclusion towards any particular group of people, including veterans, wealthy individuals, or any other demographic. Community events should be inclusive and accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive community events:

1. Avoid targeted advertising: Instead of targeting specific groups with your event promotion, focus on creating a welcoming atmosphere that appeals to a diverse audience. Use language that is inclusive and accessible to everyone.
2. Offer financial assistance: Consider offering financial assistance or scholarships to individuals who may not be able to afford the cost of attending your event. This can help ensure that your event is inclusive and accessible to people from all backgrounds.
3. Provide accommodations: Make sure your event is physically accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities. Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or wheelchair accessibility.
4. Promote diversity: Actively seek out diverse perspectives and voices when planning your event. Consider inviting speakers or performers from different backgrounds to add to the richness of your event.
5. Foster inclusive dialogue: Encourage open and respectful dialogue at your event, where everyone can feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Avoid polarizing language or topics that may create divisions within your community.
6. Offer childcare and family-friendly activities: Recognize that not everyone may be able to attend events without their families. Consider offering childcare services or family-friendly activities to make your event more inclusive for parents and caregivers.
7. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be respectful of the cultural practices and traditions of all attendees. Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or insensitive to any particular group.
8. Encourage volunteerism: Encourage volunteers from diverse backgrounds to participate in your event planning and execution. This can help ensure that your event is representative of the community it serves.
9. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where everyone feels welcome and valued. Encourage attendees to connect with each other and form meaning
