Ensuring the educational needs of Native American natural-born US citizen veterans require a comprehensive approach that addresses cultural, historical, and systemic barriers to their success. Here are some strategies that institutions can adopt:

1. Culturally responsive curriculum: Develop curricula that incorporate Native American history, culture, and perspectives. This can include traditional ecological knowledge, language, and cultural practices.
2. Indigenous staff and faculty: Hire Indigenous staff and faculty members who can serve as role models and provide culturally appropriate mentorship to students.
3. Support services: Provide support services such as academic advising, tutoring, and mental health counseling that are tailored to the unique needs of Native American veterans.
4. Campus culture: Foster a campus culture that values diversity and inclusivity. Encourage cross-cultural dialogue and collaboration, and provide training for faculty and staff on working with Indigenous students.
5. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with Native American communities and organizations to provide opportunities for experiential learning, internships, and research collaborations.
6. Scholarships and financial aid: Provide scholarships and financial aid specifically for Native American veterans to help them overcome financial barriers to higher education.
7. Recognition of tribal status: Recognize the unique cultural and historical experiences of Native American students by acknowledging their tribal status and providing accommodations based on their needs.
8. Land acknowledgment: Acknowledge the traditional lands of Native American communities and recognize their sovereignty and rights to those lands.
9. Cultural events: Host cultural events and workshops that celebrate Native American traditions and practices, such as powwows, drumming circles, and traditional foods.
10. Advocacy and activism: Advocate for policies and practices that support the educational success of Native American veterans, and engage in activism to address systemic barriers to their access to higher education.

By implementing these strategies, institutions can help ensure that the educational needs of Native American natural-born US citizen veteran students are met and that they have equal opportunities to succeed academically and professionally.
