Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Long-Time Single Beginner Arabic Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially for those who are long-time single beginner Arabic speakers. This group is characterized by their dedication to learning the Arabic language and immersing themselves in the culture, despite facing various challenges along the way. In this paper, we aim to explore the role that cultural heritage plays in shaping the identities of these individuals.

Theory:
Our study is informed by the concept of identity theory, which posits that an individual's identity is composed of multiple components, including their beliefs, values, customs, and practices (Hall, 1980). For long-time single beginner Arabic speakers, cultural heritage serves as a crucial component in shaping their identities. We propose that the preservation and celebration of cultural heritage can foster a strong sense of belonging and identity among this group.

Methods:
We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 long-time single beginner Arabic speakers, exploring their experiences with cultural heritage and its impact on their identities. We analyzed the data using thematic analysis to identify patterns and themes emerging from the participants' narratives.

Results:
Our findings reveal that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-time single beginner Arabic speakers. The participants expressed a strong sense of connection to their cultural heritage, which they believed was essential to their identity as Arabic learners. They highlighted the importance of preserving and celebrating cultural heritage, particularly through language and cultural practices, in fostering a strong sense of belonging and identity.

Conclusion:
Our study underscores the critical role that cultural heritage plays in shaping the identities of long-time single beginner Arabic speakers. By preserving and celebrating cultural heritage, these individuals are able to construct a strong sense of identity and belonging. Our findings highlight the importance of cultural heritage in fostering a positive self-image and sense of purpose among language learners.
