During the third trimester of pregnancy, moderately obese individuals may face several challenges in the healthcare system. These challenges can include:

1. Limited access to care: Obese individuals are often marginalized and stigmatized in society, which can result in limited access to healthcare services, including prenatal care.
2. Difficulty finding providers with experience in obese pregnancies: Many healthcare providers have limited experience caring for obese pregnant women, which can result in inadequate care and poor outcomes.
3. Increased risk of complications: Obesity can increase the risk of several complications during pregnancy, including gestational diabetes, hypertension, and preterm labor. These complications can lead to increased healthcare utilization and costs.
4. Difficulty with mobility and positioning: Moderately obese individuals may have difficulty moving around during pregnancy, which can make it challenging for them to undergo routine prenatal appointments or to participate in childbirth education classes.
5. Increased risk of cesarean section: Obese women are at increased risk of requiring a cesarean section (C-section) due to the larger size of their baby, which can lead to additional healthcare costs and potential complications.
6. Difficulty with breastfeeding: Obese women may face challenges with breastfeeding, including difficulty latching, poor milk production, and increased risk of mastitis.
7. Stigma and discrimination: Moderately obese individuals may experience stigma and discrimination in the healthcare system, which can lead to feelings of shame and isolation.
8. Difficulty with weight management: Obese women may struggle to maintain a healthy weight during pregnancy, which can increase their risk of complications and poor outcomes.
9. Increased risk of maternal mortality: Moderately obese women are at increased risk of maternal mortality and morbidity, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, and blood clots.
10. Difficulty with mental health: Obese individuals may experience depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues during pregnancy
