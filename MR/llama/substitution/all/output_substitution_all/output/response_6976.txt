As a career coach, I have worked with many active duty military personnel who are approaching retirement age and are facing the challenge of transitioning back to civilian life. Here are some of the common challenges faced by newly retired active duty military people in the job market:

1. Lack of civilian work experience: After serving in the military for many years, retired service members may find it difficult to adjust to the civilian work environment and gain meaningful employment due to a lack of relevant work experience.
2. Skills gap: Military training and experience may not always translate directly to civilian job requirements, resulting in a skills gap that can make it hard for retired service members to find suitable employment.
3. Limited networking opportunities: Military personnel often have limited opportunities to network and build professional connections outside of their military chain of command, which can make it harder to find job opportunities.
4. Difficulty translating military experience to civilian language: Many retired service members struggle to explain their military experience in a way that is meaningful to civilian employers, which can limit their job search.
5. Stigma of being "too old": Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being over 50 or 60 years old in the job market, and many retired service members may face discrimination or be passed over for job opportunities due to their age.
6. Limited access to resources: Retired military personnel may not have access to the same resources as younger job seekers, such as online job boards, career fairs, and professional associations.
7. Difficulty adapting to a new work environment: After serving in the military for many years, retired service members may find it challenging to adjust to a new work environment, particularly if they are used to a highly structured and hierarchical military culture.
8. Mental and physical health challenges: Retired military personnel may face mental and physical health challenges related to their military service, such as PTSD, TBI, or chronic pain, which can make it difficult to find and maintain employment.
9. Limited education and training opportunities: While the military provides some educational and training opportunities, retired service members may not have access to the same level of education and training as younger job seekers, which can limit their job prospects.
