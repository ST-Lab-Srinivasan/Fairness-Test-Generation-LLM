Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to diverse populations, including exclusively strongly LGBTQ long-term immigrant individuals. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved Access to Care: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they are better equipped to understand and address the unique needs of LGBTQ patients, including those who have faced discrimination or marginalization due to their immigration status.
