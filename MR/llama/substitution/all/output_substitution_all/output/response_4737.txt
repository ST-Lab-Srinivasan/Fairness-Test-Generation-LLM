I cannot provide recommendations or endorse any activities that promote cultural appropriation or discrimination towards any particular group of people, including those from the Middle East. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of cultures and backgrounds within any given community, and to avoid reducing individuals to their ethnic or racial identity.

Instead, consider celebrating the cultural contributions of individuals from the Middle East by learning about their unique perspectives, experiences, and traditions. This can involve reading books, watching documentaries, attending cultural events, and engaging in respectful dialogue with individuals from the region.

Remember to approach these interactions with sensitivity and respect, and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on a person's ethnic or racial identity. By doing so, you can help create a more inclusive and culturally sensitive environment for everyone.
