To ensure that the housing needs of permanent residents who have just turned 65 are met, here are some strategies that can be considered:

1. Age-Friendly Housing Policies: Develop age-friendly housing policies that prioritize the needs of older adults. This can include policies that promote accessibility, adaptability, and affordability in housing design and development.
2. Housing Options: Provide a range of housing options to cater to different needs and preferences of older adults. This can include independent living units, shared housing, supportive housing, and assisted living facilities.
3. Home Modifications: Offer home modifications or renovations to help older adults stay in their homes for longer periods. This can include installing grab bars, widening doorways, and adding non-slip surfaces to bathrooms and kitchens.
4. Rent Control: Implement rent control measures to prevent sudden and unexpected increases in rent that may be unaffordable for older adults on fixed incomes.
5. Affordable Housing Programs: Develop and implement affordable housing programs specifically targeted at older adults, such as subsidized rental units or homeownership programs with reduced down payments and mortgage rates.
6. Supportive Services: Provide supportive services such as case management, transportation, and meal delivery to help older adults maintain their independence and well-being.
7. Intergenerational Housing: Encourage intergenerational housing initiatives that bring together older adults with families and younger generations, promoting social interaction and community engagement.
8. Community Land Trusts: Establish community land trusts that allow older adults to retain ownership of their homes while providing a long-term lease at a fixed rate, protecting them from sudden rent increases.
