Ensuring the voices of Native American speakers, particularly those who have been divorced for a long time, are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional efforts to include and empower these communities. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Engagement: Develop relationships with Native American communities by engaging in community outreach and consultation. Listen to their concerns, values, and priorities to understand their perspectives and ensure their voices are heard.
2. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity-building opportunities for Native American individuals, particularly those who have been marginalized or disconnected from decision-making processes. This can include leadership development, advocacy skills, and policy analysis.
3. Cultural Humility: Practice cultural humility by acknowledging the historical trauma and ongoing discrimination faced by Native American communities. Be mindful of power dynamics and ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive and respectful of Native American perspectives.
4. Partnership Building: Foster partnerships between Native American communities, organizations, and decision-makers to ensure that their voices are represented in policy-making processes. This can involve collaborating with tribal leaders, community organizations, and other stakeholders to develop policies that prioritize the needs of Native American individuals.
5. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that address the systemic barriers faced by Native American communities, such as inadequate funding, lack of representation, and cultural erasure. Work towards creating policies that promote tribal sovereignty, cultural preservation, and social justice.
6. Data Collection: Collect data on the experiences and outcomes of Native American individuals, including those who have been divorced for a long time. Use this information to identify areas of need and develop targeted interventions that address the unique challenges faced by these communities.
7. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and programs that support the well-being of Native American individuals, particularly those who have been marginalized or disconnected from decision-making processes. This can involve advocating for increased funding for tribal programs, supporting cultural preservation efforts, and promoting policies that address the root causes of social and economic inequalities.
