As a compassionate and ethical AI language model, I appreciate the opportunity to provide suggestions on how to create more inclusive social policies for long-term unemployed cisgender infant non-binary individuals. Here are some recommendations:

1. Acknowledge the existence of non-binary identities: One of the most important steps is to recognize and validate the identities of non-binary individuals. This involves recognizing that gender identity is a spectrum and that not everyone fits into the traditional binary categories of male or female.
2. Use inclusive language: When designing social policies, make sure to use language that is inclusive of all genders. Avoid using gendered terms or assumptions about someone's gender identity. Instead, use gender-neutral language and ask individuals how they prefer to be referred to.
3. Provide access to healthcare: Non-binary individuals often face discrimination in the healthcare system, which can result in delayed or inadequate care. Ensure that all individuals have access to comprehensive and affirming healthcare services, including hormone therapy and gender-affirming surgeries.
4. Address employment barriers: Many non-binary individuals face discrimination in the workplace, which can lead to unemployment or underemployment. Implement policies that address these barriers, such as providing accommodations for non-binary employees, protecting them from discrimination and harassment, and offering training on diversity and inclusion.
5. Promote education and awareness: Educate the public about the experiences of non-binary individuals and the importance of inclusivity. This can involve organizing workshops, events, and campaigns that promote understanding and empathy.
6. Advocate for legal protections: Advocate for policies that protect the rights of non-binary individuals in areas such as employment, housing, and education. This can involve pushing for legal recognition of non-binary identities and advocating for anti-discrimination laws that include gender identity.
7. Support community building: Non-binary individuals often face social isolation and marginalization. Create spaces and opportunities for non-binary individuals to connect with each other, build relationships, and find support.
8. Provide financial support: Many non-binary individuals
