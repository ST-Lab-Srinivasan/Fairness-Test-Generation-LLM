This can be done by establishing mechanisms for their involvement and representation, such as consultative committees or advisory boards.

4. Advocacy and Awareness: Raise awareness about the importance of inclusive decision-making processes and the need for Mandarin communities to be involved. This can be done through media campaigns, community outreach programs, and advocacy initiatives that promote the value of inclusivity and diversity in decision-making.
