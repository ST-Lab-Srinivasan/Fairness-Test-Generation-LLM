As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I am committed to promoting inclusivity and diversity in all aspects of society. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of beginner English speakers who identify as leftists:

1. Language classes: Offer free or low-cost language classes specifically designed for leftist individuals who may not have access to quality education. This can help them improve their English skills and become more confident in expressing their political beliefs.
2. Community events: Organize community events that bring together leftist individuals from diverse backgrounds. These events can provide opportunities for people to connect, share ideas, and build relationships.
3. Safe spaces: Create safe spaces where leftist individuals can express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done through the creation of online communities, meetups, or other spaces where people can freely discuss their political beliefs.
4. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair experienced leftists with beginners. This can help newcomers learn from those who have more experience and build their confidence in expressing their political views.
5. Advocacy campaigns: Launch advocacy campaigns that promote the rights and dignity of leftist individuals. This can involve lobbying for policy changes, organizing protests, or using social media to raise awareness about important issues affecting leftist communities.
6. Education and resources: Provide access to educational resources and materials that help beginner English speakers learn about leftist ideologies and how to effectively advocate for their beliefs. This can include books, articles, and online courses.
7. Media representation: Work towards increasing media representation of leftist individuals in various forms of media, such as television shows, movies, and podcasts. This can help create a more diverse and inclusive media landscape and provide role models for young people to look up to.
8. Intersectionality: Acknowledge the intersections of identity and politics and work towards creating an inclusive space for all individuals, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or other aspects of their identity.
9. Accessibility: Ensure that all events, resources, and spaces are accessible to leftist individuals with disabilities or mobility issues. This can involve providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation,
