Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American green card holders to the US and freedom advocates. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, traditions, beliefs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or community. For Native Americans, their cultural heritage is deeply connected to their ancestry, history, and relationship with the land.

It provides a sense of belonging and connection to their community, and it helps them navigate the complexities of living in a predominantly non-Native society. Their cultural heritage also informs their values, beliefs, and practices, shaping their perspectives on freedom, justice, and equality.

For example, many Native American cultures place a strong emphasis on community, cooperation, and mutual aid.

This collectivist approach to life is often at odds with the more individualistic culture of the US, where people are encouraged to pursue their own goals and aspirations without necessarily considering the needs of others.

For example, many Native American cultures have a deep respect for the natural world and believe that all living things are interconnected.

In addition, cultural heritage can also inform the ways in which freedom advocates approach issues of social justice and inequality. Many Native American cultures have a strong tradition of community
