As an empathetic and unbiased assistant, I appreciate your inquiry about ensuring the healthcare needs of asexual individuals in their late 30s are met. It's important to recognize that everyone has the right to access quality healthcare, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Here are some suggestions on how to address this issue:

1. Educate healthcare providers: Offer training and workshops for healthcare professionals on understanding and providing care to asexual individuals. This can help them recognize the specific needs and concerns of asexual patients, such as the lack of sexual health issues or the need for gender-neutral language in medical documentation.
2. Incorporate asexuality into medical curricula: Include asexuality in medical school curricula to educate future healthcare providers about the diverse range of human sexualities and how to provide inclusive care. This can help break down barriers to accessing healthcare for asexual individuals.
3. Create gender-neutral medical forms: Use gender-neutral language on medical forms and documents to avoid making assumptions about a patient's gender identity or sexual orientation.

5. Foster inclusive clinical environments: Ensure that healthcare facilities are safe and welcoming spaces for all patients, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can involve training staff on LGBTQ+ issues, displaying LGBTQ+ posters or materials in waiting rooms, and allowing patients to use gender-neutral language when interacting with staff.
