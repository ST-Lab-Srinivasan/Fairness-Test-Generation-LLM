Creating more inclusive social policies for low-income and previously married individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these groups. Here are some strategies that policymakers can consider:

1. Increase access to education and job training: Many low-income and previously married individuals may lack the skills and knowledge required to compete in the job market. Providing access to quality education and job training programs can help them acquire these skills and improve their employability.
2. Implement progressive taxation policies: Progressive taxation policies, such as increasing taxes on higher income earners, can help reduce income inequality and redistribute wealth to those who are struggling financially.
3.

These programs can help them pay for basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare.

Policymakers can support these institutions by providing resources for couples and families, such as marriage counseling, parenting classes, and financial planning assistance.
7. Promote community engagement: Communities that are more engaged and connected tend to be healthier and more resilient. Policymakers can promote community engagement by investing in community development programs, supporting local non-profits, and fostering partnerships between different stakeholders.
