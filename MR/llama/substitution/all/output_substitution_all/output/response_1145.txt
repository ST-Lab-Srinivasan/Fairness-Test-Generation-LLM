Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers with mixed European heritage requires a thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach. Here are some suggestions to make the learning experience more engaging and relevant for this diverse group of learners:

1. Representation Matters: Incorporate diverse perspectives, stories, and cultural elements into your program. Use images, videos, and other materials that reflect the learners' identities and experiences. This can help them see themselves in the learning process and feel more connected to the content.

For example, provide beginner-friendly language courses or cultural workshops for those who are new to Chinese culture.
