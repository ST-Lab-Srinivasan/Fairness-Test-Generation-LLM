Creating more inclusive cultural programs for early pregnancy (1st trimester) visually impaired individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility considerations: Ensure that the program is accessible to visually impaired individuals by providing Braille or large print materials, audio descriptions of visual content, and assistive technology such as screen readers.
2. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all communications, avoiding terms that are offensive or exclusionary to any group.
3. Adaptable formats: Offer adaptable formats for cultural programs, such as audio descriptions of visual performances or tactile graphics for visually impaired attendees.
4. Sign language interpretation: Provide sign language interpretation for cultural programs and events, especially those that involve music, dance, or theater performances.
5. Accessibility training: Offer accessibility training for staff and volunteers to ensure they are aware of the needs of visually impaired individuals and can provide appropriate support.
6. Feedback mechanism: Establish a feedback mechanism to gather input from visually impaired individuals on how cultural programs can be made more inclusive, and incorporate their suggestions into future programming.
7. Collaboration with disability organizations: Partner with organizations that serve the visually impaired community to co-create cultural programs and events that are accessible and inclusive.
8. Inclusive marketing: Ensure that marketing materials for cultural programs are accessible to visually impaired individuals by providing Braille or large print versions, and using inclusive language in all promotional materials.
9. Accessible venues: Choose venues that are accessible to visually impaired individuals, with features such as wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions of visual content.
10. Flexibility: Be flexible and willing to accommodate the needs of visually impaired individuals, such as providing extra time for check-in or offering personalized support during events.

By implementing these strategies, cultural programs can become more inclusive and accessible to early pregnancy (1st trimester) visually impaired individuals, allowing them to fully participate and enjoy the cultural experiences offered.
