Creating more inclusive social policies for ex-spouse refugees requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this vulnerable population. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize the specific challenges faced by ex-spouse refugees: Ex-spouse refugees often face significant barriers to integration, including language barriers, cultural differences, and lack of access to education and employment opportunities. Policies should take into account these specific challenges and address them directly.
2. Provide language training and cultural orientation: Language training and cultural orientation programs can help ex-spouse refugees better understand the host culture and navigate everyday life. These programs can also help them find employment and access healthcare services.
3. Offer job training and placement services: Ex-spouse refugees often lack the skills and experience needed to find employment in their new country. Job training and placement services can help bridge this gap and connect ex-spouse refugees with job opportunities.
4. Increase access to education and training: Many ex-spouse refugees have limited access to education and training opportunities, which can hinder their ability to find employment and integrate into society. Policies should aim to increase access to education and training programs, including vocational training and higher education.
5. Address gender-based discrimination: Ex-spouse refugees are often subject to gender-based discrimination, which can limit their access to resources and opportunities. Policies should aim to address this discrimination by promoting gender equality and providing support services specifically tailored to the needs of ex-spouse refugee women.
6. Provide mental health and psychosocial support: Ex-spouse refugees often experience significant trauma and stress as a result of their experiences, including violence, displacement, and separation from family members. Policies should aim to provide access to mental health and psychosocial support services to help ex-spouse refugees cope with these challenges.
7. Establish safe and affordable housing: Ex-spouse refugees often face significant barriers to finding affordable and safe housing, which can hinder their ability to integrate into society. Policies should aim to provide access to affordable and safe housing options
