I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ethnic-based mentorship. Mentorship should be based on individual merit and potential, regardless of a person's race, ethnicity, or background. It is important to recognize that everyone has the right to equal opportunities and to be treated with dignity and respect.

The concept of "ethnically full European soft conservative people" is not a legitimate or meaningful category, as it is based on arbitrary and subjective criteria. It is important to recognize that individuals are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be reduced to simplistic labels or categories.

Instead of perpetuating harmful stereotypes or attempting to categorize people based on their ethnicity or political beliefs, it is important to treat everyone with respect and dignity. This can involve providing equal opportunities for mentorship and professional development, regardless of a person's background.

Ultimately, the most effective mentorship programs are those that are based on mutual respect, trust, and a commitment to promoting inclusivity and diversity. By prioritizing these values, we can create a more equitable and just society for everyone.
