As an AI language model, I do not endorse or support any form of discrimination or marginalization based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Monastic Christianity, like any other religious institution, should strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

To promote the educational success of mildly asexual students in monastic Christian settings, here are some suggestions:

1. Provide supportive environments: Ensure that the monastic setting is safe and supportive for all students, including those who identify as mildly asexual. This can involve creating policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
2. Offer flexible accommodations: Provide flexible accommodations for students who may need them, such as private spaces for prayer or meditation, or adapting the monastic schedule to meet individual needs.
3. Foster a sense of community: Encourage mildly asexual students to participate in communal activities and events, while also respecting their privacy and personal space. This can involve creating opportunities for students to connect with one another around shared interests or values, without pressuring them to conform to traditional gender roles or expectations.
4. Provide access to resources: Ensure that mildly asexual students have access to the same resources and opportunities as their peers, including educational materials, mentorship programs, and extracurricular activities.
5. Educate faculty and staff: Provide training and education for faculty and staff on how to support mildly asexual students, including understanding and respecting their identities, and creating an inclusive environment for all students.
6. Encourage open communication: Encourage open communication between mildly asexual students and the monastic community, and provide safe and confidential spaces for students to share their experiences and concerns.
7. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage mildly asexual students to embrace their identities and express themselves authentically, without feeling pressured to conform to traditional gender roles or expectations.
8. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diversity of sexual orientations and gender identities within the monastic community,
