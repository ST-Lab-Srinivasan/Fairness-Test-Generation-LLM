1. Misgendering and lack of recognition: Many genderqueer individuals face misgendering and lack of recognition in the healthcare system. They may be referred to using binary gender terms, such as "Mr." or "Ms.," despite identifying as non-binary. This can lead to feelings of erasure and invalidation.
