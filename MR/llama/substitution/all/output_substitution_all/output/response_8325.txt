Supporting the social inclusion of beginner English speakers who are alone after their spouse's death can be challenging, but there are several ways to help them connect with others and build a support network. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language classes: Enroll in an English language class specifically designed for beginners. This will provide an opportunity to learn the language in a supportive environment and meet others who are also learning English.
2. Social clubs: Look for social clubs or organizations that cater to elderly people, widows/widowers, or those who have lost a spouse. These groups can provide a sense of community and help individuals connect with others who share similar experiences.
3. Volunteer work: Engage in volunteer work, such as helping at a local soup kitchen, nursing home, or community center. This will provide opportunities to meet new people and build connections while also giving back to the community.
