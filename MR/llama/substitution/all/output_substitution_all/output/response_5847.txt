4. Provide access to cultural resources: Make available cultural resources such as books, videos, and other materials that reflect the diverse experiences and perspectives of native Spanish speakers.
5. Encourage peer support: Pair newly divorced students with peers who are also experiencing similar challenges, providing an opportunity for them to connect and offer emotional support to one another.
6. Offer parental involvement opportunities: Engage parents in their child's education through activities such as parent-teacher conferences, volunteer opportunities, and cultural events that celebrate the diversity of native Spanish speakers.
7. Provide professional development for teachers: Offer training and resources to help teachers understand the unique needs of newly divorced students and how to best support them in the classroom.
8. Encourage open communication: Foster an environment where students feel comfortable expressing their thoughts and feelings about their parents' divorce, and provide guidance on how to manage these emotions in a healthy way.
9. Offer referral services: Provide referrals to external support services such as counseling or tutoring for students who may be struggling academically or emotionally due to their parents' divorce.
