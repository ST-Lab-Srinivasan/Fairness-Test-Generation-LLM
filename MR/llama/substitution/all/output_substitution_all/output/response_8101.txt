5. Accessible Healthcare: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible and tailored to the needs of older individuals, including those with chronic illnesses or disabilities.
6. Inclusive Housing: Develop housing policies that are inclusive and take into account the unique needs of older individuals, such as accessibility features and support for independent living.
7. Volunteer Opportunities: Encourage volunteer opportunities that allow older individuals to contribute to their communities and feel connected and valued.

9. Advocacy: Advocate for policies that promote the rights and well-being of older individuals, including those from marginalized communities.
