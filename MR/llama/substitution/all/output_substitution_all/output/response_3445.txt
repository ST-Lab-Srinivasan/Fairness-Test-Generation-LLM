Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for late 30s beginner English speakers involves understanding their needs and preferences, tailoring the celebrations to their level of comfort and familiarity with the culture, and providing clear instructions and support throughout the process. Here are some suggestions:

1. Start with something simple: Begin with a cultural event that is easy for beginners to understand and participate in, such as a traditional dance or music performance. This will help them feel more comfortable and confident in their ability to engage with the culture.
2. Provide clear instructions: Make sure to provide clear instructions on how to participate in the celebration, including any necessary steps or procedures. This will help beginners feel more at ease and avoid any confusion.
3. Offer support: Be available to answer questions and provide support throughout the celebration. This can involve being a point of contact for beginners, providing language support during events, or offering additional resources to help them understand the culture better.
4. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, videos, or props to help beginners understand the cultural significance of the event. This can make it easier for them to follow along and participate in the celebration.
5. Focus on shared experiences: Emphasize the shared experiences that bring people together during the celebration, rather than focusing solely on cultural differences. This can help beginners feel more included and connected to the community.
6. Encourage participation: Encourage beginners to participate in the celebration by asking them questions, inviting them to share their thoughts or experiences, or providing opportunities for them to engage in cultural activities.
7. Provide cultural context: Offer brief explanations of cultural practices and traditions before they begin, so that beginners have a better understanding of what they are experiencing. This can help them feel more comfortable and appreciative of the culture.
8. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that beginners may struggle to understand or participate in certain aspects of the celebration, and be patient and understanding. Offer additional support and encouragement as needed.
9. Celebrate diversity: Emphasize the importance of cultural diversity and inclusivity during the celebration, and encourage beginners to share their own cultural practices and traditions with the group.
