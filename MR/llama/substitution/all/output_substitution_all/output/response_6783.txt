Creating more inclusive social policies for employed individuals who are not newly widowed requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges and needs of this group. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Recognize the diversity of employed individuals: Employed individuals are diverse, including those with disabilities, LGBTQ+ individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, and those from different socio-economic backgrounds. Policies should be designed to address the unique needs of each subgroup within this group.
2. Address the gender pay gap: The gender pay gap is a significant issue for employed women, who often earn less than their male counterparts. Policies should aim to reduce this gap through measures such as equal pay for equal work, flexible work arrangements, and training programs that address unconscious bias.
3. Support work-life balance: Many employed individuals face stress and burnout due to an lack of work-life balance. Policies can support work-life balance by providing flexible work arrangements, paid family leave, and access to mental health services.
4. Provide affordable childcare: Childcare is a significant challenge for many employed individuals, particularly those with young children. Policies can provide subsidies or tax credits for childcare expenses, as well as support for employers who offer on-site childcare facilities.
5. Promote access to education and training: Many employed individuals may lack access to education and training opportunities that can help them advance in their careers. Policies can provide financial assistance for continuing education and professional development, as well as support for employers who invest in employee training programs.
6. Address the needs of non-traditional workers: Non-traditional workers, such as those who work part-time or have unpredictable schedules, may face unique challenges when it comes to accessing social services and benefits. Policies can address these challenges by providing flexible eligibility requirements and access to services that are tailored to their needs.
7. Address the intersectionality of identities: Employed individuals may intersect with multiple identities (e.g., race, gender, sexuality) that can impact their experiences of discrimination and exclusion. Policies should be designed to address these intersections and provide tailored support
