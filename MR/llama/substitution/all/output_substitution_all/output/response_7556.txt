As a sociolinguist, I can provide some insights on the challenges faced by native French speakers who are lifetime divorced individuals in the job market. Here are some potential challenges they may encounter:

1. Stigma and stereotypes: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to divorce in many cultures, including France. This can lead to discrimination and biases against lifetime divorced individuals in the job market. Employers may view them as less desirable or reliable employees due to their marital status.
2. Limited career advancement opportunities: Divorce can often result in a significant change in lifestyle, which may impact an individual's career choices and advancement opportunities. Lifetime divorced individuals may face discrimination or be overlooked for promotions or high-level positions due to their marital status.
3. Skills and experience gaps: Depending on the length of time since the divorce, lifetime divorced individuals may have gaps in their work history or skills that can make it challenging to compete with other job applicants. This can be especially true if they took a break from their career to focus on family or personal responsibilities during the marriage.
4. Childcare and parental obligations: Many lifetime divorced individuals have childcare responsibilities, which can impact their ability to work long hours or travel frequently for work. Employers may view this as a liability or be less likely to hire them due to concerns about absenteeism or flexibility.
5. Emotional and mental health challenges: Divorce can be emotionally draining, leading to stress, anxiety, or depression. These emotional challenges can impact an individual's performance at work or their ability to navigate the job market effectively.
6. Lack of social support: After a divorce, lifetime divorced individuals may find themselves without a built-in support system, such as a spouse or family members. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can negatively impact their mental health and ability to cope with work-related stress.
7. Different expectations: Lifetime divorced individuals may face different expectations in the job market, particularly if they have been out of the workforce for an extended period.
