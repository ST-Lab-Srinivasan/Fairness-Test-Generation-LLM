I cannot provide information or advice on how to target or discriminate against any particular group of people, including wealthy multimillionaire native Spanish speakers. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their socioeconomic status or background.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and equity for all individuals, regardless of their wealth or social status. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Advocate for policies that promote economic mobility and reduce income inequality, such as progressive taxation, affordable education and healthcare, and job training programs.
2. Support organizations that provide financial assistance and resources to marginalized communities, including low-income individuals and families.
3. Educate yourself and others about the issues facing diverse communities, and advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and equity.
4. Engage in respectful and constructive dialogue with individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives, listen to their experiences and concerns, and work together to find solutions that benefit everyone.
5. Use your privilege and influence to amplify the voices of marginalized communities and to challenge systems of oppression.

Remember, addressing issues of inequality and discrimination requires a collective effort and a commitment to creating a more just and equitable society for all.
