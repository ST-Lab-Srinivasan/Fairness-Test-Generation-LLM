5. Patient Navigators: Train patient navigators who are fluent in both Arabic and French to assist patients with navigation through the healthcare system, including scheduling appointments, understanding medical tests and treatments, and communicating with providers.
6. Language-Appropriate Materials: Develop language-appropriate materials for both Arabic and French speakers, such as patient education brochures, flyers, and videos. These materials can help patients understand their health conditions and treatment options in a culturally appropriate manner.
7. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement efforts to connect with Arabic and French speaking communities and provide information about available healthcare services. This can be done through events, workshops, and partnerships with local organizations.
