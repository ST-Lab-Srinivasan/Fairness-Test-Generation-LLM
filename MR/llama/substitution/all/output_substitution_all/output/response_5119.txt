As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the term "moderate" is subjective and can be perceived as offensive or discriminatory. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve equal treatment and respect in the healthcare system.

However, I understand your query regarding the challenges faced by Native American people in the US healthcare system. Here are some of the issues they may encounter:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many Native American communities face barriers in accessing quality healthcare due to factors such as geographic isolation, lack of transportation, and limited healthcare resources in their areas.
2. Cultural differences: The healthcare system can be difficult for Native Americans to navigate due to cultural differences between traditional healing practices and the Western medical model.
3. Language barriers: Many Native American communities speak indigenous languages, which can create communication barriers with healthcare providers who may not be fluent in those languages.
4. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has led to intergenerational trauma that can manifest as mental health issues, substance abuse, and other health problems.
5. Lack of representation: Native Americans are underrepresented in the medical field, which can result in a lack of culturally competent healthcare providers who understand their unique needs and experiences.
6. Discrimination: Native Americans may experience discrimination in the healthcare system, including racial profiling, bias, and stereotyping, which can lead to mistrust and decreased access to care.
7. Limited availability of traditional healing practices: Many Native American communities rely on traditional healing practices, such as herbalism and spiritual healing, but these practices may not be recognized or supported by the healthcare system.
8. Inadequate funding: Many Native American communities face financial challenges that can limit their access to quality healthcare, including inadequate funding for healthcare programs and services.
9. Limited access to specialized care: Native Americans may have limited access to specialized medical care, such as cardiology or oncology, due to the lack of specialized providers in their communities.
