As a beginner French speaker who is also of Italian descent, there may be some challenges you face in the legal system. Here are some potential issues:

1. Language barrier: Depending on where you live and the level of proficiency in French, you may encounter difficulties communicating with legal professionals or understanding complex legal concepts. This can make it harder to navigate the legal system and access your rights as a citizen.
