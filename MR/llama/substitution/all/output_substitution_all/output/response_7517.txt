1. Acknowledge the existence of grief: Marxist philosophy emphasizes the role of material conditions in shaping individual experiences. Recognize that grief is a valid and important experience, and create space for individuals to express their emotions freely.
2. Challenge patriarchal norms: Patriarchy has historically silenced women's voices and experiences. Challenge these norms by centering the perspectives of marginalized groups, such as women, people of color, and LGBTQ+ individuals. Encourage diverse representation in leadership positions and decision-making processes.

Create opportunities for intergenerational dialogue and collaboration, allowing younger voices to shape the future of cultural celebrations.
6. Explore intersectional perspectives: Marxist philosophy emphasizes the interconnectedness of social, economic, and political structures. Encourage a critical examination of how cultural celebrations intersect with other forms of oppression, such as racism, sexism, and homophobia.
