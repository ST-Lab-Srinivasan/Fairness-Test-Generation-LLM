Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed-Latino Heritageliberal Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those with mixed ancestry. The term "mixed-Latino" encompasses a wide range of identities, including individuals who identify as Hispanic or Latino but also have non-Hispanic ancestry. This group faces unique challenges in navigating their identities and expressing their cultural heritage. This research aims to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of mixed-Latino heritageliberal individuals.

Literature Review:
Studies have shown that cultural heritage can influence an individual's identity, particularly for those with complex ancestry. Mixed-race individuals often experience identity fragmentation, where they feel a disconnection between their different cultural backgrounds (Hood, 2013). However, cultural heritage can also provide a sense of belonging and connection to one's community (Gay, 2000). The literature suggests that mixed-Latino individuals may face challenges in embracing their cultural heritage due to societal expectations and discrimination.

Methodology:
This research will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews with mixed-Latino individuals. Participants will be recruited through community outreach programs and online platforms. The interviews will explore the participants' experiences with cultural heritage, identity formation, and expressions of their mixed-Latino identity.

Theory:
This study will draw on the theoretical frameworks of identity theory (Hall, 1980) and the concept of "intersectionality" (Crenshaw, 1989). Identity theory posits that an individual's identity is shaped by multiple factors, including cultural background, social location, and personal experiences. Intersectionality theory highlights the interconnected nature of social identities, such as race, gender, and sexuality, which intersect to create unique experiences of discrimination and oppression.

Significance:
This research aims to contribute to the understanding of how cultural heritage shapes the identities of mixed-
