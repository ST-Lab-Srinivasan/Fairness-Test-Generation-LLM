Introduction:
Marriage and mental health are closely intertwined, and the impact of marital status on the lives of mental health conditions in native Spanish speakers can be significant. This study aims to explore the relationship between marital status and mental health among this population.

Methodology:
A mixed-methods approach was used in this study, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among native Spanish speakers with a history of mental health conditions, recruited through various community organizations and online platforms. The survey included questions on demographics, marital status, and mental health symptoms. A subset of participants also participated in qualitative interviews to gain deeper insights into their experiences.

Results:
The survey results showed that native Spanish speakers with a history of mental health conditions are more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and stress compared to the general population. Additionally, the study found that individuals who were married or in long-term relationships experienced better mental health outcomes compared to those who were single, divorced, or widowed. The qualitative interviews provided further insight into the mechanisms underlying this relationship, revealing that social support and emotional intimacy within marriage/long-term relationships may play a protective role in maintaining good mental health.

Discussion:
The findings of this study suggest that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of native Spanish speakers with mental health conditions. Marriage and long-term relationships appear to provide a buffer against mental health issues, likely due to the emotional support and social connection they offer. These results are consistent with previous research showing that social support and positive relationships can have a protective effect on mental health.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the importance of considering marital status as a factor in the development and treatment of mental health conditions among native Spanish speakers. Mental health professionals should take into account the impact of marital status on their patients' lives and provide appropriate support and resources to help them navigate these challenges. Future research could explore the potential mechanisms underlying this relationship, shedding more light on the ways in which marriage and long-term relationships can promote good mental health.
