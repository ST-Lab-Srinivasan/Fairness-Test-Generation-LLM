Introduction:
Marital status has been a significant factor in shaping an individual's life, including their political beliefs and affiliations. However, there is limited research on the impact of marital status on long-time single ultra-Republicans, who are a unique group within the Republican Party. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of long-time single ultra-Republicans and how it affects their political beliefs and behaviors.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that marital status can have a significant impact on an individual's political beliefs and affiliations. For instance, married individuals tend to be more conservative than unmarried individuals (Funk et al., 2018). Additionally, unmarried individuals are more likely to identify as independents or Democrats compared to married individuals (Gurriet & Hillygus, 2013). However, there is limited research on the impact of marital status on long-time single ultra-Republicans.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. The sample will consist of long-time single ultra-Republicans who have been identified through online surveys and snowball sampling techniques. A survey questionnaire will be administered to the participants, which will include questions on their political beliefs, marital status, socioeconomic status, and other demographic information. Additionally, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a subset of the participants to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and perspectives.

Expected Findings:
The study is expected to reveal several impacts of marital status on the lives of long-time single ultra-Republicans, including:

1. Increased political polarization: Long-time single ultra-Republicans may be more likely to identify as Republicans and hold more conservative political beliefs compared to married individuals.
2. Socioeconomic factors: The study will examine how marital status affects the socioeconomic status of long-time single ultra-Republicans, including their income, education level, and employment status.
3. Social isolation: Long-time single ultra-
