Creating more inclusive community events for native French speakers over the age of 90 requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that the older adults feel valued, engaged, and included. Here are some suggestions on how to create such events:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is accessible to elderly people, with easy parking, wheelchair accessibility, and well-lit pathways. Provide extra assistance if needed, such as escorts or wheelchairs, for those who may require it.
2. Programming: Offer a variety of activities that cater to the interests and abilities of older adults. This could include music, dance, art, crafts, or other creative outlets that are enjoyable and stimulating. Consider hiring professional entertainment or facilitators who specialize in working with older adults.
3. Socialization: Create opportunities for socializing and connection among the elderly attendees. This could include group meals, games, or other activities that encourage mingling and conversation.
4. Transportation: Provide transportation to and from the event, if needed, to ensure that no one is left behind due to mobility issues. Partner with local transportation services or volunteers who can provide this support.
5. Volunteer Support: Recruit volunteers who can assist with event setup, cleanup, and participation. These volunteers can also serve as ambassadors for the event, helping to promote it within the elderly community.
6. Intergenerational Programming: Incorporate intergenerational programming into the event, such as opportunities for older adults to interact with younger generations through art, music, or other activities. This can help build bridges between different age groups and create a sense of community.
7. Technology Integration: Consider incorporating technology into the event, such as tablets or digital picture frames, that can be used by elderly participants. This can help keep them engaged and connected to their peers and the world around them.
8. Multilingual Programming: Provide programming that caters to native French speakers who may not be fluent in the local language. Offer translated materials, interpreters, or bilingual facilitators to ensure that everyone can participate fully.
