The economic empowerment of undocumented recent temporary visa holders to the US, specifically those from lower-income backgrounds, is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to support their economic empowerment:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many undocumented immigrants face barriers when trying to access traditional banking services due to their immigration status. Creating alternative financial service options, such as mobile payment platforms or community-based financial cooperatives, could help them save money and access credit.
2. Job Training and Placement: Providing job training and placement services specifically tailored for undocumented immigrants can help them acquire the skills they need to compete in the US labor market. This could include language training, vocational training, and connections to potential employers.
3. Entrepreneurship Support: Undocumented immigrants often face challenges when trying to start their own businesses due to legal and financial barriers. Offering resources such as business incubators, mentorship programs, and access to affordable capital could help them overcome these obstacles.
4. Education and Skills Development: Providing access to education and skills development opportunities can help undocumented immigrants improve their economic prospects. This could include adult education programs, vocational training, and college preparation courses.
5. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocating for policies that support the economic empowerment of undocumented immigrants can help create a more supportive environment for them. This could involve pushing for changes to immigration laws, as well as advocating for policies that address the root causes of poverty and inequality.
6. Community Development: Building strong, inclusive communities that support the economic empowerment of undocumented immigrants is crucial. This could involve creating community-based organizations, promoting cultural exchange programs, and fostering partnerships between local businesses and immigrant-owned enterprises.
7. Healthcare Access: Ensuring access to affordable healthcare is essential for the economic well-being of undocumented immigrants. This could involve advocating for expanded Medicaid eligibility, creating community clinics, and providing financial assistance for medical expenses.
