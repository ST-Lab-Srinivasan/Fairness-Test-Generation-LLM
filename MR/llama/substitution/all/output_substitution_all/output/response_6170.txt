Creating inclusive community programs for individuals with no known genetic conditions as a beginner Spanish speaker can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help make these programs more accessible and welcoming. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use simple language: Avoid using complex medical terminology or jargon that may be difficult for beginner Spanish speakers to understand. Instead, use simple language and provide clear explanations of medical terms and concepts.
2. Provide visual aids: Visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, and videos can help beginners understand complex medical concepts more easily. Use images or videos to demonstrate how different body parts function, or show how genetic conditions may affect the body.
