1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds. By understanding the cultural values and beliefs of Nigerian patients, beginners can tailor their communication style to meet the patients' needs and build trust.

3. Enhanced patient satisfaction: Patients who feel that their cultural beliefs and values are respected are more likely to be satisfied with their care. By demonstrating cultural competence, healthcare providers can build positive relationships with their patients and improve patient outcomes.
4. Increased access to care: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers connect with Nigerian patients who may have historically faced barriers to accessing healthcare. By understanding the cultural norms and values of these patients, providers can better address their healthcare needs and promote greater access to care.

For example, they may need to address conflicts between traditional healing practices and evidence-based medicine or navigate differences in communication styles within a culturally diverse patient population.
6. Improved patient outcomes: Cultural competence can lead to better patient outcomes by enabling healthcare providers to tailor their interventions to the unique needs of Nigerian patients. By understanding the cultural factors that influence health behaviors and outcomes, providers can develop more effective treatment plans and improve overall health outcomes.
