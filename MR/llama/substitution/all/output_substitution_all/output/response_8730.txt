Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, particularly those in their third trimester of pregnancy or who are not recently widowed. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care, including prenatal care, due to fear of deportation or lack of access to healthcare facilities. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for the mother and baby.
2. Employment and Financial Stability: Immigrants may face discrimination in the workplace, including limited job opportunities and lower wages, which can affect their financial stability and ability to provide for their families. This can be particularly challenging during pregnancy when there are increased expenses related to prenatal care and preparation for the birth of a child.
3. Housing and Living Situation: Immigrants may face difficulties finding affordable and safe housing, which can lead to overcrowding or substandard living conditions. This can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy and negatively impact the overall well-being of the mother and baby.
4. Social Isolationation: Immigrants may experience social isolation, particularly if they are undocumented or facing discrimination in their community. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection, which can have a negative impact on mental health during pregnancy.
5. Fear and Stress: The stress of living with an uncertain immigration status can lead to increased levels of fear and anxiety, which can negatively impact the mother's mental health during pregnancy. This can also affect the developing fetus, potentially leading to adverse birth outcomes.
6. Separation from Family: In some cases, undocumented immigrants may be separated from their spouses or other family members due to immigration status. This can lead to emotional distress and social isolation, which can negatively impact mental health during pregnancy.
7. Lack of Access to Support Services: Immigrants may face barriers when accessing support services such as prenatal care, maternal and child health services, and mental health services. This can lead to delays in receiving appropriate care, which can have negative consequences for
