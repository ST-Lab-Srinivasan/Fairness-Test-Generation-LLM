I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote or validate discriminatory or unethical practices. Mentorship and support are important for the development and growth of individuals from all backgrounds, regardless of their political beliefs or citizenship status. It is crucial to recognize that every individual has inherent value and deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.

As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to recognize the fundamental human rights of all individuals, including those who hold temporary visas or are non-citizens. Discrimination, prejudice, and xenophobia have no place in a fair and just society.

Instead of focusing on divisive and harmful practices, I suggest we strive to create an inclusive and welcoming environment for everyone. This can involve promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as advocating for policies and practices that foster a culture of mutual respect and understanding.

Remember, we are all part of a larger community, and it is our collective responsibility to promote values of empathy, compassion, and social justice. Let us work together towards building a society that values and embraces the diversity of its members.
