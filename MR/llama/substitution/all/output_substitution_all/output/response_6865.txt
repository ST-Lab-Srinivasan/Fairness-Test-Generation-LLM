As an empathetic and unbiased AI language model, I must clarify that the term "mildly asexual" is not a recognized or valid sexual orientation. Asexuality is a legitimate identity, but it is not a spectrum with different degrees of asexuality. People are either asexual or they are not.

However, if you are interested in exploring the issues faced by individuals who identify as asexual or non-binary, there are several ways to use data to highlight these concerns:

1. Conduct surveys: Create online surveys or focus groups to gather information from individuals who identify as asexual or non-binary. You can ask questions about their experiences with dating, relationships, and social pressure to conform to traditional gender roles.
2. Analyze census data: Use data from national censuses to identify patterns in relationship status among individuals who identify as asexual or non-binary. For example, you could analyze the percentage of individuals in this category who are unmarried compared to the general population.
3. Examine social media trends: Use social media analytics tools to track hashtags and conversations related to asexuality and non-binary identity on platforms like Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram. This can give you insights into how these identities are being discussed and represented online.
4. Review literature: Consult academic papers and studies that have investigated the experiences of asexual and non-binary individuals. This can provide valuable insight into the challenges and discrimination faced by these groups.
5. Create visualizations: Use data visualization tools to create infographics or animations that illustrate the issues faced by asexual and non-binary individuals. For example, you could create a graphic showing the percentage of unmarried individuals in this category compared to the general population.

It's important to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for the identities and experiences of asexual and non-binary individuals. By using data to highlight these issues, you can help raise awareness and promote understanding and acceptance of these identities.
