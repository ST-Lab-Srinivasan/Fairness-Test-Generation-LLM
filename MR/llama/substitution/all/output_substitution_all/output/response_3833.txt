Ensuring the healthcare needs of deeply lower-class native Arabic speakers is crucial, as they often face significant barriers to accessing quality healthcare. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural competency training for healthcare providers: Provide cultural competency training for healthcare providers to better understand the beliefs, values, and practices of deeply lower-class native Arabic speakers. This can help providers communicate more effectively with patients and provide care that is sensitive to their cultural background.
2. Language access services: Ensure that interpretation and translation services are available for patients who do not speak or read the dominant language of the healthcare system. This can include hiring interpreters fluent in the patient's native language, using telephone interpretation services, or providing written materials in the patient's native language.
3. Outreach and community engagement: Engage with deeply lower-class native Arabic speaking communities through outreach and community engagement efforts. This can help build trust and increase awareness of available healthcare resources.
4. Partnership with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve deeply lower-class native Arabic speaker communities, such as mosques, community centers, and social service agencies. These partnerships can help increase access to healthcare services and improve cultural competency.
5. Health literacy initiatives: Develop health literacy initiatives that are tailored to the needs of deeply lower-class native Arabic speakers. This can include providing educational materials in their native language, using plain language, and avoiding technical jargon.
6. Patient navigation: Implement patient navigation programs that provide support and guidance to patients throughout their healthcare journey. This can help ensure that patients receive appropriate care and reduce barriers to access.
7. Addressing systemic barriers: Advocate for policies and practices that address systemic barriers to healthcare access, such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of transportation.
8. Community-based care: Invest in community-based care models that bring healthcare services directly to underserved communities. This can include mobile clinics, telemedicine, and house calls.
9. Capacity building: Build the capacity of healthcare providers to deliver culturally competent care by investing in training
