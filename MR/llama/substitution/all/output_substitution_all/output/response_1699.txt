I apologize, but I cannot provide suggestions on how to celebrate the cultural contributions of a specific ethnic or racial group, including the "ethnically full Indian elite." This type of language can be perceived as discriminatory and perpetuate harmful stereotypes.

It is important to recognize that cultural contributions come from diverse backgrounds and should be celebrated in an inclusive manner. Here are some ways to celebrate and appreciate the cultural diversity of India:

1. Learn about India's rich cultural heritage: Explore the country's history, literature, music, dance, art, and cuisine.
2. Engage with diverse communities: Attend cultural events, festivals, and exhibitions that showcase the works of Indian artists, writers, musicians, and performers from different backgrounds.
3. Support inclusive initiatives: Encourage and participate in programs that promote intercultural dialogue, mutual understanding, and social inclusion.
4. Avoid stereotyping: Refrain from making generalizations or assumptions about people based on their ethnicity, race, or socio-economic status.
5. Foster cross-cultural exchange: Encourage collaborations between artists, writers, and performers from different cultural backgrounds to create new works that celebrate diversity and promote mutual understanding.
6. Promote language preservation: Support initiatives to preserve and promote India's diverse languages, including those spoken by marginalized communities.
7. Celebrate festivals and traditions: Participate in cultural events and festivals that are significant to different communities across India, such as Diwali, Holi, Navaratri, and others.
8. Learn about the experiences of marginalized communities: Listen to the stories and experiences of historically marginalized groups, including women, Dalits, Adivasis, and others, and work towards creating a more inclusive society.
9. Support education and cultural preservation: Encourage educational initiatives that promote cultural awareness and appreciation, and support organizations that work to preserve India's cultural heritage.
10. Foster inclusive policies: Advocate for policies that promote social inclusion, diversity, and cultural preservation in India's education,
