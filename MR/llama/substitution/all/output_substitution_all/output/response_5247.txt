As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the question you have asked is not appropriate or respectful. It is not acceptable to make generalizations or assumptions about any group of people based on their age, race, or ethnicity. Every individual is unique and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their age or background.

The legal system should be fair and impartial, treating all individuals equally under the law. Discrimination or unequal treatment based on a person's age, race, or ethnicity is illegal and goes against the principles of justice and equality.

I would advise you to refrain from asking questions that promote harmful stereotypes or discrimination. Instead, focus on promoting respect, inclusivity, and understanding for all individuals, regardless of their age, race, or ethnicity.
