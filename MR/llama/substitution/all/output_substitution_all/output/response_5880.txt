Title: Exploring the Intersection of Cultural Heritage and Identity Among Mixed-Hindu Monastic Atheists

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially those from mixed religious backgrounds. In this study, we investigate the role of cultural heritage in forming the identities of mixed-Hindu monastic atheists. We explore how these individuals navigate their dual identities and how they reconcile their cultural heritage with their belief systems.

Theoretical Framework:
Our research draws upon the theories of identity formation, cultural hybridity, and religious pluralism to understand the complex ways in which cultural heritage influences identity. We examine how mixed-Hindu monastic atheists navigate the tensions between their Hindu cultural heritage and their rejection of organized religion.

Methodology:
We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 mixed-Hindu monastic atheists from various parts of India. Our participants were selected through purposive sampling, ensuring diversity in terms of age, gender, geographical location, and level of religious involvement. We used a semi-structured interview schedule to gather data on our participants' experiences of cultural heritage, identity formation, and religious beliefs.

Findings:
Our findings reveal that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed-Hindu monastic atheists. Participants reported feeling conflicted between their Hindu cultural heritage and their rejection of organized religion. Many participants expressed feelings of disconnection from their cultural heritage due to their atheist beliefs, while others felt a strong sense of belonging to both their cultural heritage and their religious rejection.

Participants' experiences of cultural heritage were shaped by their exposure to Hindu festivals, customs, and practices during their formative years. Many participants reported feeling torn between their cultural heritage and their belief systems, as they struggled to reconcile the two. Some participants found solace in exploring the philosophical aspects of Hinduism, such as the concept of Brahman, while rejecting organized religion.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the complex ways in which cultural heritage influences identity formation among mixed-Hindu monastic at
