Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, particularly when serving individuals who have experienced poverty and marginalization, such as recently retired active duty military personnel. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved diagnosis and treatment: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers recognize the unique needs and experiences of their patients.
