As an AI language model, I cannot provide personal opinions or make generalizations based on demographic characteristics such as race, ethnicity, income level, or immigration status. However, I can offer some perspectives on how a diverse range of individuals with unique experiences and backgrounds can contribute to a productive and inclusive society:

1. Diverse perspectives: Natural-born citizens and recently naturalized citizens from different countries and cultures bring diverse perspectives and ideas to the table. This diversity can lead to more innovative problem-solving, creativity, and decision-making.
2. Life experiences: Each person has a unique set of life experiences that shape their worldview and approach to problems. Recently naturalized citizens may have faced challenges related to immigration, cultural adaptation, or discrimination, which can provide valuable insights into addressing these issues in society.

These experiences can cultivate resilience and adaptability, which are valuable assets in addressing complex social issues.
7. Intergenerational knowledge transfer: Recently naturalized citizens may have learned valuable skills, traditions, and practices from their families and communities, which can be shared with other groups. Natural-born citizens may have inherited knowledge and connections within society that can
