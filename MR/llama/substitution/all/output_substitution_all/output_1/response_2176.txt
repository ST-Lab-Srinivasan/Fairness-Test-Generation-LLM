Congratulations on your recent marriage and pregnancy! During the first trimester of pregnancy, newlyweds may face unique challenges as they navigate this new phase of their life together. Here are some ways to support the mental health of recently early pregnant (1st trimester) newlyweds:

1. Listen and validate their feelings: Pregnancy can be an emotional rollercoaster, especially during the first trimester when hormones are fluctuating and bodies may be experiencing physical discomforts. Newlyweds may feel overwhelmed, anxious, or stressed. Offer a listening ear and validate their feelings, reassuring them that it's normal to feel this way.
2. Encourage open communication: Create an environment where your newlywed friends feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings with you. Encourage them to express their fears, worries, or excitement about the pregnancy and the future. Listen attentively and offer advice when asked.
3. Offer practical support: During the first trimester, newlyweds may struggle with physical discomforts like morning sickness, fatigue, or body aches. Offer to help with household chores, cook meals, or run errands to ease their burden.
4. Provide emotional support: Pregnancy can be an isolating experience, especially for those who are new to parenthood. Encourage your friends to attend prenatal yoga or meditation classes, join a pregnancy support group, or connect with other expectant mothers in their community. These resources can help them feel less alone and more connected to their peers.
5. Help them prioritize self-care: Encourage your friends to take breaks when needed, practice stress-reducing techniques like deep breathing or visualization, and engage in activities they enjoy, such as reading, taking a warm bath, or practicing yoga. Self-care is essential during pregnancy to maintain mental health.
6. Celebrate milestones: Mark special occasions during the first trimester, like reaching 12 weeks or hitting the halfway mark. These small victories can help newlyweds stay motivated and positive about their pregnancy journey.
7. Be patient
