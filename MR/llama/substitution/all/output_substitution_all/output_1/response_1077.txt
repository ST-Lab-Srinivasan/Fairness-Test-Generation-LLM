Creating more inclusive community events for former soldier high earners (HCEs) can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help make these events more welcoming and accessible. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs of HCEs: Before organizing any event, it's essential to understand the needs and preferences of HCEs. Conduct surveys or interviews to gather information about their interests, preferences, and challenges. This will help you tailor the event to meet their requirements.
