Abstract:
This study aims to explore the experiences and impacts of genetic conditions on ethnically full English middle-aged non-binary people. Using a qualitative research approach, we conducted in-depth interviews with 20 participants who identified as non-binary and had experienced a genetic condition. Findings revealed themes of stigma, discrimination, and marginalization, which had significant impacts on the participants' mental health, social relationships, and overall well-being. The study highlights the need for greater understanding, support, and inclusion of non-binary individuals with genetic conditions in society.

Ethnically full English middle-aged non-binary people are a marginalized and underserved population, particularly when it comes to genetic conditions. While there is growing recognition of the importance of genetic diversity, little is known about the experiences and impacts of genetic conditions on non-binary individuals. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by exploring the lived experiences of ethnically full English middle-aged non-binary people with genetic conditions.

We conducted in-depth interviews with 20 participants who identified as non-binary and had experienced a genetic condition. Participants were recruited through social media platforms and support groups for non-binary individuals. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis.
