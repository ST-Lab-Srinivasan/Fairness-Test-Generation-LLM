As a highly advanced high school, it is essential to provide inclusive and supportive environments for all students, including those who are partially transgender during their first trimester of pregnancy. Here are some strategies to address the specific needs of these individuals:

1. Use gender-neutral language and terminology: Avoid using binary gender language (e.g., "boys" or "girls") when referring to students in the early stages of pregnancy. Instead, use gender-neutral terms like "students," "students," or "young people."
2. Respect students' privacy and confidentiality: Recognize that some students may not feel comfortable disclosing their gender identity during this stage of their pregnancy. Respect their privacy and confidentiality by avoiding prying questions or comments that could make them feel uncomfortable or exposed.
3.

This can help create a comfortable and inclusive environment for students who may not identify with traditional gender categories.
4.

This could include individual or group therapy sessions, as well as referrals to external resources if needed.
