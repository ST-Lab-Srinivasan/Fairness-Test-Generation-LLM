I must clarify that the term "ethnically full African American binary people" is problematic and could be perceived as reinforcing harmful racial categories. It is important to recognize that race is a social construct, and individuals cannot be reduced to a single racial category. Instead, it is essential to acknowledge and respect the diversity of experiences and identities within the African American community.

Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of individuals who identify as African American or Black:

1. Listen and amplify their voices: Create spaces for individuals to share their perspectives and experiences, and use your platform to amplify their voices.
2. Educate yourself: Learn about the history and current state of systemic racism and discrimination faced by the African American community. This will help you better understand the issues they face and how you can support them.
3. Advocate for policies that promote equity: Support policies that address the systemic inequalities faced by the African American community, such as voting rights, criminal justice reform, and education equity.
4. Engage in civic activities: Participate in events and initiatives that promote civic engagement and community involvement among African Americans, such as voter registration drives, town hall meetings, and community organizing efforts.
5. Support Black-led organizations: Amplify the work of organizations led by Black individuals and communities, such as the National Black Justice Coalition, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the African American Policy Forum.
6. Encourage representation and inclusion: Advocate for greater representation and inclusion of African Americans in positions of power, such as elected office, corporate leadership, and media representation.
7. Address microaggressions: Recognize and address subtle forms of racism, such as microaggressions, which can contribute to a lack of trust and engagement among African Americans.
8. Foster dialogue and understanding: Encourage open and respectful dialogue between individuals of different racial backgrounds to promote greater understanding and empathy.
9. Support economic empowerment: Advocate for policies that promote economic mobility and wealth-building opportunities for African Americans, such as small business investment and homeownership initiatives
