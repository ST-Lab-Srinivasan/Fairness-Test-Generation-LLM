I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ethnic or racial-based discrimination. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. The concept of "ethnically full Indian ultra-socialist people" is not a valid or recognized social category, as India is a diverse country with a complex history of social and cultural interactions.

Mentorship can play a positive role in the personal and professional development of individuals from any background, regardless of their race or ethnicity. However, it is important to recognize that mentorship alone cannot address systemic inequalities and discrimination. Structural changes, such as policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, are also necessary to create a more just and equitable society.

In conclusion, mentorship can be a valuable tool for personal and professional development, but it must be accompanied by broader efforts to address systemic inequalities and discrimination. The promotion of ethnic or racial-based categories is not a valid or useful framework for understanding social identity or promoting social change.
