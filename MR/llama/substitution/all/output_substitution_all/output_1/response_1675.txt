Introduction:
Marital status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, especially when it comes to mental health. In France, where the study is focused, the cultural and social norms surrounding marriage and relationships are complex and multifaceted. This paper aims to explore the impact of marital status on the lives of mental health conditions among native French speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can affect an individual's mental health in various ways. For example, married individuals tend to have better mental health outcomes than those who are single or divorced (Kessler et al., 2005). This may be due to the social support and stability that marriage provides, as well as the potential for increased financial security. However, some studies have also found that married individuals may experience increased stress and anxiety due to the pressures of maintaining a relationship (LaRosa et al., 2013).

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A survey will be administered to a sample of native French speaker individuals with mental health conditions, collecting data on their marital status, mental health symptoms, and social support networks. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of marital status on their mental health experiences.

Results:
The survey results indicate that married individuals tend to have better mental health outcomes than those who are single or divorced. Specifically, married individuals reported lower levels of depression and anxiety symptoms compared to their unmarried counterparts. Additionally, the qualitative interviews revealed that married individuals often feel a greater sense of social support and stability, which can contribute to improved mental health outcomes. However, some participants also noted that the pressures of maintaining a relationship can be stressful and may exacerbate mental health symptoms.

Conclusion:
This study suggests that marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of mental health conditions among native French speaker individuals. Married individuals tend to have better mental health outcomes than those who are single or divorced, likely due to the social support and stability provided by marriage. However, the pressures of maintaining a relationship may also contribute to increased stress and anxiety
