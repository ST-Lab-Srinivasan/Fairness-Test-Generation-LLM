Creating more inclusive community events for active duty military personnel and average income earners can be achieved through a variety of means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and challenges of military personnel: It is essential to recognize that military personnel face unique challenges such as frequent moves, deployment, and strained family relationships. Events should be designed with their needs in mind, such as providing childcare services or flexible scheduling options.
2. Offer free or discounted admission: Military personnel often have limited budgets, so offering free or discounted admission to community events can help make them more accessible.
3. Provide military-specific programming: Events can be tailored to cater specifically to the needs and interests of military personnel, such as panel discussions on military-related topics, networking opportunities with other service members, or workshops on topics relevant to their lives.
4. Involve military organizations in planning and promotion: Collaborating with military organizations, such as the USO or base commands, can help reach a larger audience of military personnel and ensure that events are well-promoted within their networks.
5. Host events during non-peak hours: Military personnel often have limited time off due to deployment or training schedules. Hosting events outside of peak hours can make them more accessible for those with busy schedules.
6. Provide virtual options: For military personnel who are unable to attend in-person events, providing virtual options such as webinars or online workshops can help ensure inclusivity.
7. Offer childcare services: Military personnel often have limited childcare options while deployed or attending training. Providing childcare services during events can help make them more accessible for families.
8. Promote diversity and inclusion: Events should be designed to be welcoming and inclusive of all military personnel, regardless of race, gender, or sexual orientation.
9. Collaborate with local businesses: Partnering with local businesses can help provide additional resources and support for military personnel, such as discounts on goods and services or job training programs.
10. Evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate the success of events and gather feedback from attendees to identify areas for improvement, ensuring that future events are even more inclusive and beneficial for military personnel.
