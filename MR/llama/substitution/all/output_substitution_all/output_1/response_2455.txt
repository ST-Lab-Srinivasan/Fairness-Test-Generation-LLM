Introduction:
 Military status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those in their late 30s who are recently single. This study aims to explore the effects of military status on the lives of such individuals, including their emotional well-being, social relationships, and career development.

 Literature Review:
 Previous studies have shown that military service can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On one hand, military service can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment, as well as opportunities for personal growth and development (Koontz & Keller, 2013). On the other hand, military service can also lead to stress, anxiety, and depression, particularly during deployments and in times of conflict (Baker et al., 2015).

Methodology:
 This study will use a qualitative research design, with in-depth interviews conducted with a purposive sample of 20 individuals who are recently single in their late 30s and have experience with military status. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and social media advertising, and will be interviewed via video conferencing or phone calls. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results:
 Preliminary findings indicate that military status can have both positive and negative impacts on the lives of recently single individuals in their late 30s. Some key themes that emerged from the interviews include:

1. Emotional well-being: Many participants reported experiencing anxiety, depression, and stress as a result of military status. This was particularly true during deployments and in times of conflict.
2. Social relationships: Military service can have a significant impact on social relationships, with some participants reporting strained or damaged relationships due to long-distance separations or deployment-related stress.
3. Career development: Military service can provide opportunities for career advancement and professional development, but can also create challenges for individuals who may face discrimination or limited job prospects upon transitioning back to civilian life.
4. Identity and purpose: Military status can shape an individual's identity and sense of purpose, particularly for those who have served in combat zones or experienced traumatic events during their military service.
