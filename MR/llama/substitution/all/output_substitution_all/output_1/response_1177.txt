Creating more inclusive recreational activities for documented, non-low-income professional people can be achieved by focusing on accessibility, affordability, and tailored programming. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Accessible facilities and programs: Ensure that recreational facilities and programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their physical abilities. Provide adapted sports equipment, modify recreational activities to accommodate different needs, or offer virtual options for those who may not be able to participate in person.
2. Affordable pricing: Offer flexible pricing structures or scholarships to make recreational activities more affordable for professional people with different income levels. Partner with local businesses or organizations to offer discounted rates or package deals.
3. Tailored programming: Develop recreational activities that cater to the interests and abilities of diverse professional groups. For example, offer sports leagues or fitness classes specifically designed for professionals in different industries (e.g., tech, finance, healthcare).
4. Community outreach and marketing: Reach out to local professional communities through events, workshops, or social media campaigns. Promote the benefits of recreational activities, such as stress relief, networking opportunities, and personal growth.
5. Partnerships with community organizations: Collaborate with local non-profits, schools, or community centers to offer joint recreational programs or events. This can help increase visibility and accessibility, especially for marginalized communities.

7. Inclusive programming: Ensure that recreational activities are inclusive of diverse backgrounds, cultures, and identities. Offer workshops or classes that promote cultural exchange, mutual respect, and understanding.
8. Volunteer opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for professional people to give back to their communities through recreational activities. This can help build connections and foster a sense of social responsibility.
9. Corporate team-building programs: Offer customized team-building programs for businesses, focusing on interactive and inclusive activities that promote collaboration,
