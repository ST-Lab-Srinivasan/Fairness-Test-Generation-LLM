As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to respect people's privacy and personal preferences when it comes to their sexual orientation or any other personal aspect. However, if you are interested in understanding the issues faced by strongly asexual individuals who have not been divorced for a long time, here are some potential data-driven insights:

1. Conduct surveys or interviews: You could conduct online surveys or in-person interviews with individuals who identify as strongly asexual and have not been divorced for an extended period of time. This can help you gather quantitative and qualitative data on the issues they face, such as social isolation, stigma, and discrimination.
2. Analyze existing data: You could analyze existing data from surveys, studies, or other sources that have collected information on asexual individuals or those who have not been divorced. For example, you could examine data from the National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS) in the United States, which has collected information on sexual orientation and relationship status.
3. Use social media analysis: You could use social media analysis tools to gather data on the issues faced by strongly asexual individuals online. For example, you could analyze Twitter data using hashtags related to asexuality or marriage to identify trends and patterns in how these topics are discussed online.
4. Create a dataset: You could create a dataset of asexual individuals who have not been divorced for an extended period of time. This dataset could include demographic information, such as age, gender, and location, as well as data on the issues they face, such as social isolation and stigma.
5. Use machine learning algorithms: You could use machine learning algorithms to analyze the data you have collected and identify patterns or trends in the issues faced by strongly asexual individuals who have not been divorced for an extended period of time. For example, you could use supervised learning algorithms to classify individuals based on their relationship status and identify differences in the issues they face compared to other groups.

It is important to note that when using data to highlight issues faced by strongly asexual individuals who have not been divorced for an extended period of time, it is essential to prioritize ethical considerations, such as respecting privacy and avoid
