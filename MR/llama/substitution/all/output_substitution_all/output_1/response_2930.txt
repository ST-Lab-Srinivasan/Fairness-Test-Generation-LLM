I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. Cultural heritage is an important aspect of an individual's identity, but it should not be used to stereotype or make assumptions about a person's beliefs or values.

It is important to recognize that individuals have their own unique experiences, beliefs, and values, which are shaped by a complex array of factors including cultural heritage, personal experiences, and social and political contexts. It is not productive or respectful to make generalizations about any group of people based on narrow categories such as race or ethnicity.

Instead, it is important to approach individuals with an open mind and a willingness to listen to their perspectives and experiences. By doing so, we can gain a more nuanced understanding of the complex factors that shape an individual's identity and worldview.
