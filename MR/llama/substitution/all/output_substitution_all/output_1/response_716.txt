Creating inclusive community programs for physically able-bodied very young individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Involve them in the planning process: Invite the young individuals to participate in the planning and decision-making process of the community programs. This will give them a sense of ownership and agency, and help ensure that the programs are tailored to their needs and preferences.
2. Use age-appropriate language and communication: When communicating with the young individuals, use language and terminology that they can understand. Be aware of any sensory sensitivities or communication challenges they may have, and provide appropriate support.
3. Provide diverse and inclusive activities: Offer a range of activities that cater to different interests and abilities. This could include sports, art, music, drama, or other creative pursuits. Ensure that the activities are accessible and enjoyable for all participants.
4. Create safe and accessible spaces: Ensure that the community programs are held in safe and accessible spaces. This includes physical accessibility (e.g., wheelchair ramps, accessible restrooms) as well as emotional safety (e.g., no bullying or teasing).
5. Foster positive relationships: Encourage positive interactions between participants by promoting respect, empathy, and inclusivity. Use icebreaker activities or other strategies to help participants get to know each other and build friendships.
6. Provide support for diverse needs: Offer accommodations and support for participants with different abilities and needs. This could include sign language interpretation, audio descriptions, or additional supports for individuals with sensory processing challenges.
7. Involve the community: Encourage community involvement in the planning and delivery of the programs. This can help build a sense of ownership and engagement among community members, and ensure that the programs are tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the very young individuals.
8. Offer flexible scheduling options: Consider offering flexible scheduling options to accommodate different needs and preferences. For example, some participants may prefer morning or afternoon sessions, while others may benefit from evening sessions.
9. Provide opportunities for socialization: Very young individuals may have limited opportunities for socialization
