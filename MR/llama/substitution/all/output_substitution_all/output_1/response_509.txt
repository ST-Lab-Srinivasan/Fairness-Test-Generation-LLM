As a Nigerian lawyer, I must emphasize that the term "moderate socialist" is quite broad and encompasses a wide range of beliefs and political views. However, I will provide some general challenges faced by beginner Nigerian speakers in the legal system, taking into account their socio-economic background and political ideology.

1. Limited access to legal resources: Many beginner Nigerian speakers may not have access to quality legal resources such as books, journals, and online databases. This can hinder their ability to research and understand the law, especially in specialized areas of law.
2. Financial constraints: Legal education can be expensive, and many beginner Nigerian speakers may struggle to afford the costs of law school and other legal training. This can limit their opportunities for advancement in the legal field.
3. Lack of mentorship: Beginner Nigerian speakers may not have access to experienced lawyers who can provide guidance and mentorship, which can hinder their ability to develop their legal skills and knowledge.
4. Cultural barriers: As a Nigerian lawyer, I must acknowledge that the legal system in Nigeria is largely based on British common law, which may not be tailored to the cultural and social norms of beginner Nigerian speakers. This can create challenges for those who are unfamiliar with Western legal concepts and practices.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against beginner Nigerian speakers is still prevalent in the legal system. This can manifest in various forms, such as bias in hiring, promotion, or access to legal resources.
6. Limited job opportunities: Beginner Nigerian speakers may face limited job opportunities due to a lack of representation and networking opportunities within the legal profession.
7. Difficulty navigating the legal system: The legal system can be complex and challenging for beginner Nigerian speakers, especially those who are unfamiliar with the language and procedures of the court. This can lead to confusion, delays, and frustration.
8. Limited access to justice: Beginner Nigerian speakers may face barriers in accessing justice due to a lack of legal resources, knowledge, or representation. This can result in marginalized communities being denied access to their rights and entitlements under the law
