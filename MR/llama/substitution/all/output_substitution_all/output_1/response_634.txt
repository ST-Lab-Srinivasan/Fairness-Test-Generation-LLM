Addressing the Needs of Not Lower Middle-Income Mandarin Individuals in Disaster Response: A Framework for Inclusive Disaster Resilience

Introduction:

Disaster response and recovery efforts often prioritize the needs of lower-income communities, overlooking the unique challenges faced by not lower middle-income individuals. This group includes those with moderate incomes who may struggle to access resources and services during disasters. To build more inclusive disaster resilience, it is essential to understand the specific needs of this population and develop targeted strategies to support them.

Key Findings:

1. Housing instability: Not lower middle-income Mandarin individuals may face housing insecurity due to inadequate insurance coverage or lack of access to affordable housing options. Disasters can exacerbate this issue, leaving them vulnerable to displacement and homelessness.
2. Limited financial resources: These individuals may struggle to cover basic needs during disasters, as they have limited financial reserves to draw upon. They may also face difficulties in accessing government aid or other forms of support due to bureaucratic barriers or lack of access to information.
3. Isolation and marginalization: Not lower middle-income Mandarin individuals may feel excluded from disaster response efforts, which can lead to a sense of powerlessness and disconnection from their community.
4. Language barriers: Mandarin is the primary language spoken in Taiwan, and not all individuals speak it fluently. This can create communication challenges during disaster response efforts, particularly if resources are only available in Mandarin.
5. Limited access to information: Not lower middle-income Mandarin individuals may have limited access to information about disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. This lack of knowledge can make it difficult for them to prepare themselves or their families effectively.

Strategies for Inclusive Disaster Resilience:

1. Community outreach and education: Develop culturally appropriate outreach programs that provide information on disaster preparedness, response, and recovery efforts to not lower middle-income Mandarin individuals. This can help build trust and foster a sense of community involvement.
2. Financial support and resources: Develop targeted financial assistance programs that
