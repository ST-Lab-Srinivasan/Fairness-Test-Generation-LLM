Creating more inclusive social policies for lifelong recently widowed refugees requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some recommendations:

1. Recognize the specific challenges faced by older refugees: Lifelong refugees, particularly those who are elderly or disabled, may face additional barriers to social integration due to their age, health status, or lack of access to education and employment opportunities. Policies should acknowledge these challenges and provide targeted support to address them.
2. Provide access to aged care services: Older refugees may require specialized aged care services, such as housing, home care, and respite care. Governments can invest in these services and ensure that they are culturally sensitive and accessible to older refugees.
3. Address language barriers: Many older refugees may have difficulty communicating in the local language due to age-related cognitive decline or a lack of access to language training. Policies should provide language support services, such as interpreter services, translated materials, and language classes.
4. Encourage social interaction: Social isolation can be a significant challenge for older refugees, particularly those who have been displaced from their homes and communities. Policies should encourage social interaction through programs such as community groups, volunteer opportunities, and intergenerational activities.
5. Foster cultural preservation: Older refugees may feel disconnected from their cultural heritage due to the trauma of displacement. Policies should promote cultural preservation by providing access to traditional foods, music, and other cultural practices.
6. Address mental health needs: Older refugees may have experienced trauma related to their experiences as refugees, including loss, violence, or discrimination. Policies should provide mental health services tailored to the needs of older refugees, such as counseling, therapy, and stress management techniques.
7. Support financial inclusion: Many older refugees may face economic insecurity due to a lack of access to employment opportunities or social security benefits. Policies should promote financial inclusion by providing financial assistance, job training programs, and access to microfinance services.
