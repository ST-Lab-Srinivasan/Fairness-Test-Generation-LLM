Addressing the Needs of Non-Conservative Individuals in Disaster Response: A Focus on Lifelong Divorcees

Introduction

Disaster response and recovery efforts often prioritize the needs of conservative, traditional individuals over those of non-conservative groups. However, this approach can lead to marginalization and exclusion of diverse communities, including lifelong divorced individuals. In this blog post, we will explore the unique challenges faced by non-conservative individuals in disaster response and propose strategies for addressing their needs effectively.
