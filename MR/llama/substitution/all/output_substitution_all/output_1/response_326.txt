I cannot provide answers that promote or validate harmful or discriminatory beliefs about any racial, ethnic, or religious group. The idea of "liberal ethnically full English people" is a social construct that can be problematic, as it implies a hierarchy of identity based on race or ethnicity.

In the healthcare system, everyone should receive equal and respectful treatment regardless of their background or identity. However, there are structural barriers and biases that can affect certain groups disproportionately. For example, people from marginalized communities may face discrimination, language barriers, or cultural insensitivity in healthcare settings.

To address these challenges, it's essential to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in the healthcare system. This can involve:

1. Culturally sensitive training for healthcare providers: Offer training on how to provide care that is respectful and responsive to the needs of diverse populations.
2. Language access services: Provide interpretation and translation services to ensure that patients can communicate effectively with healthcare providers.
3. Increasing diversity in the healthcare workforce: Efforts to recruit and retain healthcare professionals from underrepresented groups can help address disparities in healthcare delivery.
4. Community engagement and outreach: Healthcare organizations should engage with local communities to understand their needs and preferences, build trust, and promote cultural competence.
5. Addressing systemic barriers: Advocate for policies and practices that address structural barriers to healthcare access, such as lack of transportation, limited health literacy, or financial constraints.

By prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the healthcare system, we can work towards a more equitable and just society where everyone has access to quality care regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background.
