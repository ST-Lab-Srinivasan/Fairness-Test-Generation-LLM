The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who have been married multiple times, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care during their pregnancy, including language barriers, lack of transportation, and fear of deportation. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for the mother and baby.
2. Fear and stress: Living in a state of constant uncertainty and fear can take a significant toll on an individual's mental health, particularly during a vulnerable time like pregnancy. The stress of immigration status can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
3. Social isolation: Individuals who are undocumented or in a mixed-status household may experience social isolation due to fear of being deported or discrimination from their community. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection, which can have negative effects on mental health and well-being during pregnancy.
4. Limited access to resources: Undocumented immigrants may face limitations when accessing resources such as food assistance programs, housing support, and job training. This can make it difficult for them to provide for their basic needs, let alone those of a growing baby, during their third trimester of pregnancy.
5. Insecurity about the future: The uncertainty surrounding immigration status can create an atmosphere of insecurity and fear about the future, particularly for individuals who are undocumented. This can make it difficult to focus on the needs of the baby and may lead to feelings of hopelessness and despair.
6. Stigma and shame: The stigma and shame associated with being an immigrant in a mixed-status household can lead to feelings of low self-worth and embarrassment, which can negatively impact mental health during pregnancy.
7. Limited access to legal support: Individuals who are undocumented or in a mixed-status household may face challenges when seeking legal support, such as obtaining a lawyer or navigating the court system. This can limit their ability to advocate for themselves and their family members during pregnancy.
8. Fear of separation
