Non-lower-class undocumented recent refugees to the US face significant challenges in accessing healthcare in the US. Here are some of the main challenges they encounter:

1. Lack of Health Insurance: Undocumented immigrants are often unable to access health insurance through their employers or through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace due to their immigration status. This means they may not have coverage for essential healthcare services, including preventive care, emergency care, and chronic disease management.
2. Limited Access to Public Health Services: While some undocumented immigrants may be eligible for limited healthcare services through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), many are not eligible due to their immigration status. This can limit their access to essential healthcare services, including prenatal care, pediatric care, and mental health services.
