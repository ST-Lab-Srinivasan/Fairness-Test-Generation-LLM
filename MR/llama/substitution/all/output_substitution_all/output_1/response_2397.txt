Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly married beginner Arabic speakers. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Language and Cultural Practices: Arabic is the language of Islam, and for many Muslims around the world, it is an essential part of their cultural identity. As a result, newly married individuals who are beginners in Arabic may feel pressure to learn the language and adopt the cultural practices associated with it. This can help them connect with their heritage and express their identity within their communities.
2. Family Values: In many Arab cultures, family is highly valued, and marriage is seen as a union between two families rather than just two individuals. As a result, newly married beginners may feel pressure to conform to traditional gender roles and expectations within their families. This can shape their identities and influence how they express themselves within their communities.
3. Religion: Islam is the dominant religion in many Arab cultures, and it plays a significant role in shaping individual identities. Newly married beginners may feel pressure to adopt certain religious practices and beliefs, such as prayer, fasting during Ramadan, or other rituals associated with their faith. This can help them connect with their heritage and express their identity within their communities.
4. Traditional Dress: In many Arab cultures, traditional dress is an important aspect of cultural heritage. Newly married beginners may feel pressure to adopt the traditional dress associated with their culture, such as a hijab or kufi for women, or a thawb for men. This can help them express their identity within their communities and connect with their heritage.
5. Food and Cuisine: Arab cuisine is rich and diverse, reflecting the cultural diversity of the region. Newly married beginners may feel pressure to learn about traditional Arab dishes and cooking techniques, such as shawarma, kebabs, or falafel. This can help them connect with their heritage and express their identity within their communities.
6. Music and Dance: Arabic music and dance are an important part of cultural heritage in the region. Newly married beginners may feel pressure to learn traditional dances, such as belly dancing or raqs sharqi, or to listen to traditional music
