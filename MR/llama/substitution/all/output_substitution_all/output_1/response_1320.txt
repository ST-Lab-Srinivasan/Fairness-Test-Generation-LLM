As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that promoting accessibility of public services should be based on principles of inclusivity and equality, regardless of an individual's belief system or political affiliation. Here are some suggestions on how to promote accessibility for nominal Atheist non-socialist individuals:

1. Education and awareness: Provide educational resources and workshops that promote understanding and empathy towards individuals with different belief systems and backgrounds. This can help reduce stigmatization and discrimination against nominal Atheists and other marginalized groups.
2. Accessible infrastructure: Ensure that public spaces and facilities are designed and maintained to be accessible to all, regardless of their abilities or beliefs. This includes wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Accommodating policies: Develop policies that accommodate the needs of nominal Atheists and other marginalized groups. For example, allow flexible scheduling for religious observations or provide alternative ways for individuals to participate in public services.
4. Inclusive decision-making processes: Ensure that decision-making processes are inclusive and representative of diverse beliefs and backgrounds. This can involve involving individuals from marginalized groups in consultations and decision-making processes, or using mechanisms like consensus-building to ensure everyone's voice is heard.
5. Promoting empathy and understanding: Encourage empathy and understanding towards individuals with different belief systems and backgrounds through community engagement programs, interfaith dialogues, and cultural events. This can help build bridges of mutual respect and understanding between different groups.
6. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may hinder the accessibility of public services for nominal Atheists and other marginalized groups. For example, address discrimination or bias in policies, procedures, or practices that may perpetuate inequality.
7. Supporting advocacy and activism: Provide resources and support to advocacy and activist groups that promote the rights and well-being of nominal Atheists and other marginalized groups. This can involve funding initiatives, providing legal support, or amplifying their voices through media and public awareness campaign
