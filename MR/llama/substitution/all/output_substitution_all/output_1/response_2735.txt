Supporting the economic empowerment of upper middle-income ethnically full African Americans requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the systemic barriers and structural inequalities they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and Skills Development: Provide access to quality education and skills training programs tailored to their interests and needs. This could include vocational training, entrepreneurship development, and leadership programs.

This can be achieved through initiatives such as crowdfunding platforms, angel investors, or venture capital firms focused on supporting underrepresented entrepreneurs.
4. Business Incubation and Acceleration: Provide resources and support for startups and small businesses owned by African Americans in the upper middle-income category. This could include incubators, accelerators, and coworking spaces with tailored programs and services.
