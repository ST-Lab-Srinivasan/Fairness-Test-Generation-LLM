Creating more inclusive social policies for low-income ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to create a more supportive and equitable society:

1. Access to Healthcare: Ensure that low-income ex-spouse individuals have access to quality healthcare services, including mental health support. This can be achieved by expanding Medicaid coverage, providing subsidies for health insurance premiums, or establishing community health clinics.
2. Financial Support: Provide financial assistance to help low-income ex-spouse individuals cover basic needs such as housing, food, and clothing. This can be done through programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or by offering financial aid for rent/mortgage, utilities, and other expenses.
3. Education and Job Training: Offer job training and education programs to help low-income ex-spouse individuals acquire new skills and find employment opportunities. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and certification programs.
4. Child Custody Support: Ensure that low-income ex-spouse individuals have access to legal aid for child custody disputes. Provide resources such as free or low-cost attorney services, mediation services, and parenting classes to help them navigate the complex legal system.
5. Housing Assistance: Offer subsidies or support for low-income ex-spouse individuals to secure stable housing. This can include rent assistance, down payment assistance, or help with security deposits.
6. Community Support Networks: Establish community-based networks that provide emotional and practical support to low-income ex-spouse individuals. These networks can offer everything from childcare services to transportation assistance, and can help connect them to resources and services they need.
7. Advocacy and Awareness: Raise awareness about the challenges faced by low-income ex-spouse individuals and advocate for policy changes at the local, state, and federal levels. This can include lobbying for increased funding for social services, advocating for more inclusive legislation, or organizing community events to raise awareness
