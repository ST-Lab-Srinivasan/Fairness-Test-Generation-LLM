Title: The Significance of Family Support in the Success of Moderate-Income Casual Athiests

Introduction:
Modern societal shifts have resulted in a growing number of individuals who identify as atheists, yet face challenges due to social stigma and discrimination. This study aims to investigate the impact of family support on the success of moderate-income casual atheists. By examining the role of family dynamics, this research can provide insights into the ways in which supportive families can foster the well-being and achievements of atheist individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have highlighted the importance of social support in mitigating the negative effects of discrimination and stigma on mental health outcomes (Koenen et al., 2016). Similarly, research has shown that family support can significantly improve the academic performance and career success of individuals from marginalized groups (Hsu et al., 2013). However, little is known about the specific role of family support in the context of atheism.

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis techniques. A survey will be administered to a sample of 6700 moderate-income casual atheists, inquiring about their experiences with family support and its impact on their well-being and achievements. Additionally, a subset of participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to gather more detailed insights into the role of family support in their lives.

Expected Results:
The study will contribute to our understanding of the complex interplay between family dynamics and atheist identity. Specifically, we expect to find that:

1. Moderate-income casual atheists who experience supportive family environments are more likely to report improved well-being and achievements compared to those without such support.
2. The quality of the relationship between atheists and their families is a significant predictor of success, with individuals reporting higher levels of satisfaction and commitment in supportive environments.
3. Family support can serve as a protective factor against discrimination and stigma, enabling atheists to navigate difficult social situations more effectively.

Conclusion:
This study
