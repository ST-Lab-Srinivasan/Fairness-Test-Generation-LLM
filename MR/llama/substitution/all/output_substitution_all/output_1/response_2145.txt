Creating more inclusive cultural programs for early pregnancy (1st trimester) partly heterosexual individuals requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach that acknowledges the unique needs and experiences of this group. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all gender identities, such as "pregnant people" instead of "pregnant women." This helps to create a safe and welcoming environment for everyone.
2. Education and resources: Provide education and resources on pregnancy and parenting that are tailored to the specific needs of partly heterosexual individuals. This can include information on prenatal care, birthing options, and postpartum support.
3. Support groups: Offer support groups specifically for partly heterosexual individuals who are experiencing early pregnancy. These groups can provide a safe space for sharing experiences, emotions, and concerns, as well as offering practical advice and guidance.
4. Accessibility: Ensure that cultural programs are accessible to partly heterosexual individuals by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, ASL interpretation, or closed captioning. This helps to ensure that everyone can participate fully.
5. Involve LGBTQ+ community: Involve the LGBTQ+ community in the planning and implementation of cultural programs for early pregnancy. This helps to ensure that the needs and experiences of partly heterosexual individuals are taken into account and that the programs are tailored to their specific needs.
6. Flexibility: Be flexible and adaptable when designing cultural programs for early pregnancy. Recognize that every individual's experience is unique, and be willing to make adjustments as needed to ensure that everyone can participate fully.
7. Sensitivity training: Provide sensitivity training for staff and volunteers involved in cultural programs to help them understand the experiences and challenges faced by partly heterosexual individuals during early pregnancy. This helps to create a more empathetic and supportive environment.
8. Safe space: Create a safe space for partly heterosexual individuals to share their experiences and feelings without fear of judgment or discrimination. This can be done through the use of confidentiality agreements, secure communication channels, or designated spaces for sharing.
