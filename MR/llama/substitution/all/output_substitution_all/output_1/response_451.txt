Supporting the social inclusion of natural-born Japanese citizens aged over 90 years old (or over 85 years old) can be challenging due to various factors such as physical limitations, cognitive decline, and social isolation. However, there are several ways to support their social inclusion and promote their well-being:

1. Home visits and transportation assistance: Many elderly individuals in Japan may have difficulty leaving their homes due to mobility issues or lack of transportation options. Offering home visits or providing transportation assistance can help them access essential services, socialize with others, and maintain their independence.
2. Community-based programs: Implementing community-based programs that provide social activities, exercise classes, and mental stimulation can help older adults stay engaged and active. These programs can also help reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation.
3. Technology-assisted support: Utilizing technology such as smartphones, tablets, or virtual reality devices can help elderly individuals connect with others, access information, and maintain their cognitive function. For example, video conferencing can enable them to stay in touch with family members or participate in social events remotely.
4. Caregiver support: Providing emotional and practical support to caregivers can help them manage the demands of caring for elderly relatives. This can include respite care, counseling, and access to resources such as training programs or financial assistance.
5. Health and wellness services: Offering health and wellness services, such as medical check-ups, physical therapy, or nutrition counseling, can help older adults maintain their physical health and mobility.
6. Intergenerational programs: Organizing intergenerational programs that bring together elderly individuals and younger generations can help foster social connections and promote mutual understanding between age groups. Examples include cross-generational mentorship, cultural exchange events, or joint volunteering opportunities.
7. Accessible recreational facilities: Providing accessible recreational facilities, such as parks, gardens, or community centers, can enable elderly individuals to engage in leisure activities that promote physical and mental well-being.
8. Volunteer programs: Encouraging volunteer work for older adults can help them stay engaged
