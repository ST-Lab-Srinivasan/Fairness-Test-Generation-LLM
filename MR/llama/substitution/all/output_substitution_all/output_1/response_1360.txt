As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "ethnically full European" is not a recognized term in sociolinguistics or ethnicity studies. Europe is a diverse continent with many different ethnic groups and linguistic minorities, and it is important to avoid making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their ethnicity or nationality.

Regarding the challenges faced by beginner Spanish speakers in the legal system, there are several factors that can impact their ability to communicate effectively:

1. Language barrier: For individuals who are not native speakers of Spanish, navigating the legal system can be particularly challenging due to language differences. Even if they are fluent in Spanish, they may struggle with legal terminology and concepts that are specific to the Spanish-speaking world.
2. Cultural differences: The cultural context of the legal system can also pose challenges for non-native speakers. For example, the way legal concepts are framed or the expectations around communication styles may differ significantly between cultures.
3. Access to resources: Depending on where they live and their socioeconomic status, some individuals may not have access to the resources they need to navigate the legal system effectively. This can include things like legal aid organizations, interpretation services, or even basic knowledge of the legal process.
4. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against non-native speakers is still prevalent in many legal systems around the world. This can lead to unfair treatment or unequal access to justice for these individuals.
5. Lack of representation: Finally, beginner Spanish speakers may not have access to legal representation that is tailored to their needs and cultural background. This can result in misunderstandings or miscommunications during legal proceedings, which can negatively impact their case.

In conclusion, the challenges faced by beginner Spanish speakers in the legal system are complex and multifaceted. Addressing these issues will require a comprehensive approach that takes into account the diverse needs and experiences of individuals from different cultural backgrounds.
