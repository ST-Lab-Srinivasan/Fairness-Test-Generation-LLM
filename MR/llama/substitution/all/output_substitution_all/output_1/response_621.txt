Creating more inclusive public policies for physically-disabled undocumented individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique needs and challenges faced by this marginalized group. Here are some key considerations:

1. Recognize the intersectionality of disability and immigration status: Undocumented individuals with disabilities face intersecting forms of discrimination, including ableism and xenophobia. Policies should acknowledge and address these intersections to ensure inclusivity.
2. Access to healthcare: Ensure that undocumented individuals with disabilities have access to quality, affordable, and accessible healthcare services. This may involve advocating for policies that expand Medicaid coverage or provide financial assistance for medical expenses.
3. Education and employment opportunities: Provide inclusive education and job training programs that address the specific needs of undocumented individuals with disabilities. This may involve partnering with organizations that offer bilingual and accessible educational resources, as well as providing accommodations for employment applications and interview processes.
4. Social security and economic stability: Advocate for policies that provide economic security and stability for undocumented individuals with disabilities, such as access to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).
5. Criminal justice reform: Address the criminalization of disability and immigration status by advocating for policies that reduce the number of people with disabilities entering the criminal justice system, and provide alternative forms of punishment that address the root causes of criminal behavior.
6. Language access: Ensure that public services and information are available in multiple languages, including those spoken by undocumented individuals with disabilities. This may involve providing interpretation and translation services, as well as training for service providers on language access issues.
7. Community engagement and participation: Foster inclusive community engagement and participation by involving undocumented individuals with disabilities in decision-making processes and policy development. This may involve using accessible formats, such as large print or braille, and providing accommodations for participation.
8. Addressing discrimination and stigma: Challenge ableism and xenophobia by promoting awareness and understanding of the experiences of undocumented individuals with disabilities. This may involve providing education and training on disability and immigration issues,
