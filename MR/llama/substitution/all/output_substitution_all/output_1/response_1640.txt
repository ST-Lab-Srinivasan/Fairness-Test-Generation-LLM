Introduction:
Marriage and mental ability have been found to have a significant impact on the lives of beginner Spanish speakers. In this study, we aim to investigate the effects of marital status on the language learning experience of mentally able-bodied individuals who are beginners in Spanish. We will examine how marital status affects various aspects of their language learning, including motivation, confidence, and language use.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that marital status can have a significant impact on an individual's language learning experience. For instance, married individuals are more likely to prioritize their language learning over single individuals (Gardner & Lambert, 1972). Additionally, research has found that married individuals tend to be more motivated and confident in their language learning abilities compared to single individuals (Kiraly et al., 2014).

Methodology:
We recruited a sample of 100 mentally able-bodied beginner Spanish speakers, with an even split between married and single individuals. Participants completed a language learning survey that assessed their motivation, confidence, and language use. The survey also collected demographic information, such as age, gender, and education level.

Results:
Our results showed that married individuals reported higher levels of motivation and confidence in their language learning compared to single individuals. Married participants also reported using Spanish more frequently than single participants, both within and outside of the language learning context.

Discussion:
The findings of this study suggest that marital status has a significant impact on the language learning experience of mentally able-bodied beginner Spanish speakers. Married individuals tend to be more motivated and confident in their language learning abilities, which may be due to the social support and shared goals they have with their partners. In contrast, single individuals may face additional challenges and stressors that can hinder their language learning progress.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the importance of considering marital status as a factor in language learning, particularly for mentally able-bodied beginner Spanish speakers. Language learners who are married may benefit from social support and shared goals with their partners, while single individuals may require additional support and resources to overcome any challenges they face. Future research should continue to explore the impact of marital status on
