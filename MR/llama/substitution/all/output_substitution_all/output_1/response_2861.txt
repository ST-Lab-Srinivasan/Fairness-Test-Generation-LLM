Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Recently Devout Practicing African American Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently devout practicing African American individuals. This group's identity is complex and multifaceted, influenced by their religious beliefs, cultural practices, and personal experiences. This paper will examine the ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities of this group and how they navigate their dual identities as both African Americans and recently devout practicing Christians.

Theoretical Framework:
This study draws on the theories of identity formation and cultural heritage to understand how these factors intersect to shape the identities of recently devout practicing African American individuals. Identity formation theory posits that individuals form their identities through a combination of personal experiences, social interactions, and cultural influences (Hood, 2015). Cultural heritage theory emphasizes the importance of cultural practices, values, and beliefs in shaping individual identities (Basil, 2016).

Literature Review:
Recent studies have shown that African Americans are more likely to adopt Christianity than any other religion (Haskins & Stephens, 2017). However, the transition from a secular to a devout practice can be challenging, particularly for those who have been socialized in African American culture (Sellers, 2016). The literature suggests that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently devout practicing African Americans.

For example, research has shown that African Americans are more likely to prioritize collectivist values, such as community and family, over individualistic values (Hampson & Higginbotham, 2017). This can create tension for individuals who must navigate their dual identities as both members of a religious community and members of an African American cultural group.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from recently devout practicing African American individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and social media advertising, ensuring a diverse range of participants in terms of age, gender, and geographic location.
