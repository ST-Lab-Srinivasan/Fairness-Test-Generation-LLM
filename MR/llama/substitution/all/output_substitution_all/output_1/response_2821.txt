Addressing the Needs of Not Disabled Mixed-Caribbean Heritage Individuals in Disaster Response: A Call to Inclusivity and Diversity

Introduction

Disaster response and recovery efforts often overlook the needs of not disabled mixed-Caribbean heritage individuals, a group that faces unique challenges due to their intersectional identity. This article highlights the importance of inclusivity and diversity in disaster response and provides recommendations for addressing the specific needs of this group.

Intersectionality and Disability

Intersectionality is a framework that recognizes the interconnected nature of social identities such as race, gender, sexuality, and disability. Not disabled mixed-Caribbean heritage individuals experience these intersections of identity, which can lead to unique experiences and challenges in disaster response situations. For instance, a person with both African and Indigenous Caribbean ancestry may face discrimination based on their race or ethnicity, while also experiencing ableism due to societal expectations of what it means to be disabled or not disabled.

Accessibility and Inclusivity

To address the needs of not disabled mixed-Caribbean heritage individuals in disaster response, it is essential to prioritize accessibility and inclusivity. This can be achieved by:

1. Consulting with diverse communities: Engage with community leaders and members from various backgrounds to understand their specific needs and concerns.
2. Providing accessible information: Ensure that communication materials are available in multiple formats, such as braille, large print, and audio, to reach a broader audience.
3. Inclusive decision-making processes: Involve diverse perspectives in emergency planning and response decision-making to ensure that the needs of all individuals are considered.
4. Accessible emergency shelters: Ensure that emergency shelters are accessible and inclusive, with accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and assistive technology.
5. Disability-inclusive training: Provide training for disaster response personnel on disability awareness and inclusion, to ensure that they can effectively serve diverse communities during emergencies.
6. Accommodating cultural practices: Respect the cultural practices and beliefs of not disabled mixed-Caribbean
