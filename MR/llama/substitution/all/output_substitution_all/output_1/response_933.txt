Addressing the specific needs of Native natural-born US citizen partnered individuals in education requires a comprehensive approach that considers their unique cultural, social, and historical context. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Incorporate traditional knowledge and practices into curriculum design: Native partners have valuable traditional knowledge and practices that can enrich the educational experience for all students. Incorporating these into curriculum design can help make learning more relevant, engaging, and culturally responsive.
2. Provide culturally responsive teaching methods: Teachers should be trained in culturally responsive teaching methods that recognize and respect the cultural backgrounds of Native students. This includes using teaching strategies that are tailored to the needs of Native learners and promoting a positive self-image among Native students.
3. Foster inclusive classroom environments: Classrooms should be designed to promote inclusivity and respect for diversity. Teachers can create a safe and welcoming space by acknowledging and valuing the cultural backgrounds of all students, including those from Native communities.
4. Develop partnerships with Native communities: Educational institutions should develop meaningful partnerships with Native communities to better understand their needs and priorities. These partnerships can help ensure that educational programs are culturally responsive and address the specific needs of Native students.
5. Provide mentorship and support: Native students often face unique challenges in higher education, including cultural barriers and discrimination. Educational institutions should provide mentorship and support to help these students succeed academically and navigate the challenges they may face.
6. Address systemic barriers: Educational systems must address systemic barriers that prevent Native students from accessing quality education. This includes addressing inadequate funding, lack of resources, and structural barriers that can hinder academic success.
7. Promote language revitalization: Many Native languages are at risk of extinction due to the loss of fluency among younger generations. Educational institutions should prioritize language revitalization efforts to help preserve and promote Native languages.
8. Provide cultural immersion programs: Cultural immersion programs can provide Native students with opportunities to learn about their own cultures and traditions while also promoting cross-cultural understanding and appreciation
