Creating more inclusive social policies for working-class bereaved individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the specific needs and challenges faced by this group. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the unique experiences of working-class bereaved individuals: Working-class bereaved individuals often face additional barriers, such as financial strain, lack of access to resources and support, and social isolation. Policies should recognize these differences and address them explicitly.
2. Provide financial support: Working-class bereaved individuals may struggle with funeral expenses, which can be a significant burden. Governments can offer financial assistance or subsidies for funeral costs, particularly for those who cannot afford them.
3. Offer counseling and mental health services: Bereavement can have a profound emotional impact on individuals, especially those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who may lack access to mental health resources. Policies should prioritize providing free or low-cost counseling and mental health services to help bereaved individuals cope with their loss.
4. Create social support networks: Working-class bereaved individuals may feel isolated due to social, cultural, or economic factors. Policies can encourage the formation of support groups, either in-person or online, where individuals can connect with others who understand their experiences.
5. Promote education and awareness: Education and awareness campaigns can help break down stigmas associated with bereavement and promote a better understanding of the needs of working-class bereaved individuals. This can include public service announcements, school programs, or community outreach initiatives.
6. Address systemic barriers: Policies should address broader societal issues that affect working-class bereaved individuals, such as inadequate healthcare systems, limited access to education and job opportunities, and discriminatory practices in the workplace. By addressing these systemic barriers, policies can help reduce the overall burden of bereavement on working-class individuals.
7. Encourage employer support: Employers can play a crucial role in supporting bereaved employees by offering flexible work arrangements, bereavement leave, and access to counseling services. Policies should encourage employers to provide these benefits
