Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of native Chinese speakers in their late 30s, particularly in China. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Career opportunities: In China, political affiliation can affect career opportunities. Government jobs and positions within state-owned enterprises are often reserved for members of the Communist Party of China (CPC). As a result, native Chinese speakers who are not members of the CPC may face challenges in advancing their careers or accessing certain job opportunities.
2. Social mobility: Political affiliation can also impact social mobility in China. Members of the CPC may have greater access to education and other resources, which can enhance their social status and opportunities for upward mobility. Non-members may face limitations in these areas, which can affect their overall well-being and quality of life.
3. Personal freedoms: In China, political affiliation can impact personal freedoms, such as the ability to express oneself freely or participate in political activities. Members of the CPC may have greater freedom to express their opinions and participate in politics, while non-members may face restrictions on these activities.

5. Social stigma: In some cases, political affiliation can lead to social stigma or discrimination against non-members. Members of the CPC may be seen as more prestigious or desirable, while non-members may face negative attitudes or stereotypes from their peers.
