3. Preservation of Traditional Arts and Crafts: Support the preservation of traditional arts and crafts, such as basket weaving, pottery, and woodcarving, which are an essential part of mixed Caribbean heritage communities. This can be done through workshops, demonstrations, and exhibitions that showcase these skills and traditions.
4. Language Preservation: Encourage the preservation of the languages spoken in mixed Caribbean heritage communities, such as Creole, Patois, and Haitian Creole. This can be done through language classes, cultural events, and community outreach programs that promote language usage and appreciation.

This can include exchange programs for artists, musicians, and cultural practitioners who can share their skills and knowledge with each other.
