Creating more inclusive cultural events for individuals with cognitive impairments during the third trimester of pregnancy requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions on how to make these events more accessible and enjoyable for all participants:

1. Provide clear instructions and communication: Make sure that all event materials, including flyers, invitations, and programs, are in a format that is easy to read and understand. Consider using large print or Braille for individuals with visual impairments. Also, provide audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, extra seating, and assistive listening devices. Consider hiring attendants to assist individuals with mobility impairments or providing a quiet room for those who may need a break from the stimulation of the event.
3. Use visual aids: Use visual aids such as pictures or videos to help communicate information instead of relying solely on verbal communication. Consider using tactile graphics or objects for individuals with sensory processing impairments.
4. Offer activities: Provide activities that are inclusive and accessible to all participants, such as touch tours, art-making stations, or music-making workshops. Make sure that these activities are tailored to the individual's abilities and interests.
5. Have a diverse cast of performers: Consider having a diverse cast of performers that include individuals with cognitive impairments, such as actors with intellectual disabilities or autism. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and provide role models for attendees.
6. Create a safe space: Create a safe space where participants feel comfortable and supported. Provide a quiet room or area for individuals who may need a break from the stimulation of the event, and ensure that there are enough staff members on hand to provide support as needed.
7. Involve participants in the planning process: Involve participants in the planning process by asking for their input and ideas. This can help create a more inclusive and participatory event.
8. Provide sensory-friendly materials: Provide sensory-friendly materials such as fidget toys, weighted blankets, or noise-cancelling headphones for individuals who may benefit from
