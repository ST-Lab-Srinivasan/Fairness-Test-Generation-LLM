Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of LGBTQ Individuals with Diverse Political Beliefs

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who identify as LGBTQ and hold diverse political beliefs. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of actively equal, moderate, and extreme Republican LGBTQ individuals. By examining the intersection of cultural heritage, identity, and political beliefs, this research will provide insights into the complex ways in which individuals construct their identities and engage with society.

 Literature Review:

Moderate Republicans, on the other hand, may feel conflicted about their cultural heritage due to its potential impact on their political beliefs and social relationships (e.g., "I struggle with reconciling
