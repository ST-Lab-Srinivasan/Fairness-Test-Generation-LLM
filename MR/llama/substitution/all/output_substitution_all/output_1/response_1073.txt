Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Ethnically Full Italian, Devout Atheist Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including those who identify as ethnically full Italian and devoutly atheist. This paper aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of such individuals and how they navigate their dual identities.

Theory:
Cultural heritage can shape individual identities in various ways. For ethnically full Italian individuals, cultural heritage may influence their sense of belonging, values, beliefs, and practices. At the same time, devout atheism can provide a moral framework for navigating these cultural influences. The intersection of these two identities can create a complex and multifaceted identity that is shaped by both cultural heritage and personal beliefs.

Methods:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews with ethnically full Italian, devoutly atheist individuals. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and social media advertisements, ensuring a diverse sample of individuals. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for an in-depth analysis of participants' experiences and perspectives.

Results:
Preliminary findings suggest that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically full Italian, devoutly atheist individuals. Many participants expressed feeling a strong connection to their Italian cultural heritage, including traditional foods, music, and festivals. At the same time, they also expressed feeling conflicted about reconciling their cultural heritage with their personal beliefs as atheists. Some participants reported feeling embarrassed or ashamed of their cultural heritage due to its perceived association with religion. However, others embraced their cultural heritage and found ways to incorporate it into their atheist belief system.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of identity formation for ethnically full Italian, devoutly atheist individuals. Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping these identities, and navigating this intersection can be challenging. However, by
