Disability can have significant impacts on the lives of refugees, regardless of their marital status. Here are some potential effects of disability on the lives of refugee individuals who are not recently widowed:

1. Access to services and resources: Refugees with disabilities may face barriers when accessing essential services such as healthcare, education, and employment. These barriers can be related to physical accessibility, communication, or societal attitudes towards disability.
2. Social isolation: Refugees with disabilities may experience social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, or a lack of access to social activities and events. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and marginalization.
3. Economic difficulties: Refugees with disabilities may face additional economic challenges, such as limited employment opportunities or higher costs related to accommodating their disability. This can exacerbate existing financial struggles.
4. Mental health impacts: The experience of displacement and trauma can have significant mental health impacts on refugees, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

5. Lack of representation: Refugees with disabilities may feel marginalized within their host communities, resulting in a lack of representation and voice in decision-making processes related to their needs and rights.
6. Limited access to education: Refugees with disabilities may face barriers when accessing education, including physical accessibility issues or a lack of accommodations for their disability. This can limit their ability to learn and participate fully in society.
7. Discrimination and stigma: Refugees with disabilities may experience discrimination and stigma within their host communities, which can further marginalize and isolate them.

9. Limited participation in community activities: Refugees with disabilities may face barriers when participating in community activities, such as religious services, cultural events, or volunteer opportunities. This can limit their opportunities for social interaction and
