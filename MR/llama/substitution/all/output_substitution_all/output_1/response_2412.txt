It is important to recognize that Latinos are a diverse group, encompassing a wide range of cultures, languages, and experiences. However, despite the growing diversity within the Latino community, there are still significant challenges faced by non-lower-class ethnically full Latino people in the healthcare system. Here are some of the challenges that have been identified:

1. Language barriers: Many non-lower-class ethnically full Latinos may face language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers, particularly if they do not speak Spanish fluently. This can lead to misunderstandings and a lack of effective communication, which can negatively impact their health outcomes.
2. Cultural insensitivity: Healthcare providers may be unfamiliar with the cultural practices and beliefs of non-lower-class ethnically full Latinos, leading to inappropriate or insensitive care.

These barriers can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can negatively impact their health outcomes.
4. Discrimination and bias: Non-lower-class ethnically full Latinos may experience discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, which can lead to a lack of trust in the healthcare system and poorer health outcomes.
