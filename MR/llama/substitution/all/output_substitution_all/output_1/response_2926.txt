2. Identity negotiation: Non-libertarian mixed Hispanic individuals may find themselves navigating multiple identities and cultural narratives, as they encounter different expectations and experiences based on their race, ethnicity, nationality, or political beliefs. This negotiation can lead to a more nuanced understanding of self and identity.
3. Resistance and activism: Mixed Hispanic individuals who identify as non-libertarian may be more likely to engage in social and political activism, particularly if they feel their identities are being marginalized or erased.
