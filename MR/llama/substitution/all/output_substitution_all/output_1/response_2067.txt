1. Language Training Funding: Providing adequate funding for language training programs specifically designed for military personnel can help them improve their French skills more effectively. This can include both in-person and online courses, as well as language exchange programs with native speakers.

Military Language Proficiency Standards: Establishing standardized language proficiency requirements for military personnel serving in French-speaking countries can help ensure that they are able to communicate effectively and carry out their duties.

This could involve offering courses specifically designed for dependents, as well as providing resources and support to help them learn French alongside their military family members.
8. Inter-Service Language Exchange Programs: Establishing language exchange programs between different branches
