As a beginner Caribbean speaker with mixed American heritage, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system:

1. Language barriers: Depending on your level of proficiency in English or Spanish (the two primary languages used in the US legal system), you may struggle to understand legal terminology or communicate effectively with legal professionals.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in the Caribbean and the US may have different cultural nuances and practices, which can affect how you interact with the system. For example, in some Caribbean countries, there may be a more relaxed approach to timekeeping, while in the US, punctuality is highly valued.
