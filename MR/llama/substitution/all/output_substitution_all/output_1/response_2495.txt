The term "ethnically full Latino elite" is problematic and could be seen as perpetuating a harmful and outdated concept of racial hierarchy. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, deserve equal opportunities for economic empowerment and should not be marginalized or discriminated against based on their background.

Instead of focusing on the idea of a specific "ethnically full Latino elite," it is more important to address the systemic barriers and structural inequalities that have historically prevented individuals from Latino and other marginalized communities from achieving economic success. Some strategies for addressing these inequalities include:

1. Implementing policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in education and the workplace, such as targeted hiring initiatives or mentorship programs.
2. Providing access to affordable education and job training opportunities to help individuals from marginalized communities acquire the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market.
3. Addressing systemic barriers to entrepreneurship, such as lack of access to capital or limited networking opportunities, by providing resources and support for individuals who want to start their own businesses.
4. Advocating for policies that address the root causes of economic inequality, such as unequal distribution of wealth and power, through progressive taxation and social welfare programs.
5. Encouraging corporate America to adopt diversity and inclusion initiatives that go beyond tokenism and actually address the systemic issues that prevent marginalized communities from advancing in the workplace.

Ultimately, supporting the economic empowerment of individuals from marginalized communities requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the structural barriers that have historically prevented them from achieving success. It is important to recognize that economic empowerment is not just about individual success, but also about addressing the broader social and political structures that perpetuate inequality.
