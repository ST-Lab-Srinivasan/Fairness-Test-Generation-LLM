I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ethnic or racial-based distinctions. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, are entitled to the same basic rights and dignity.

Mentorship can play a positive role in the development of any individual, regardless of their cultural or ethnic background. A mentor can provide guidance, support, and encouragement to help an individual grow and achieve their goals. However, it is important to recognize that mentorship alone cannot solve systemic issues of discrimination or inequality.

In the case of Indian people, particularly those from marginalized communities, mentorship can play a crucial role in helping them navigate the complex social and economic landscape. A mentor can provide valuable insights and advice on how to overcome obstacles and challenges, and help them build their confidence and self-esteem.

However, it is important to recognize that mentorship must be accompanied by broader systemic changes that address the root causes of discrimination and inequality. This includes challenging harmful stereotypes and biases, advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and diversity, and providing opportunities for marginalized communities to participate fully in society.

Ultimately, mentorship can be a powerful tool for promoting social justice and equality, but it must be part of a broader effort to address the systemic issues that perpetuate inequality and discrimination.
