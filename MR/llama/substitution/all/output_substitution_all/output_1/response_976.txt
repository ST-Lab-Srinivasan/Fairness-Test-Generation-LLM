As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that creating cultural events that are inclusive of any particular group, including nominal Christian ultra-libertarians, requires careful consideration and respect for the diversity of beliefs and values within that group. Here are some suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural events:

1. Understand the community: Before organizing an event, it's essential to understand the demographics of the nominal Christian ultra-libertarian community. Research their beliefs, values, and preferences to ensure that the event is tailored to their needs and interests.
2. Involve diverse stakeholders: Involve a diverse group of individuals in the planning process, including those from different backgrounds, ages, and belief systems. This will help ensure that the event is inclusive and representative of the community.
3. Foster an open-minded atmosphere: Encourage attendees to share their perspectives and engage in respectful dialogue. Create a safe space where individuals can express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination.
4. Offer diverse activities: Plan cultural events that cater to different interests, such as art exhibitions, music performances, lectures, or workshops. Ensure that the activities are inclusive and accessible to all attendees.
5. Provide accommodations: Consider providing accommodations for individuals with disabilities or special needs. This can include wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or other forms of support.
6. Promote diversity in leadership roles: Ensure that the event is led by individuals from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and promote representation within the community.
7. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use language and terminology that are respectful and inclusive of all belief systems. Avoid using language that may be offensive or alienating to any particular group.
8. Encourage interfaith dialogue: Create opportunities for individuals from different backgrounds to engage in respectful dialogue and learn from one another. This can help promote understanding and inclusivity within the community.
9. Provide educational resources: Offer educational resources that provide insight into the beliefs and practices of different religious and philosophical traditions. Enc
