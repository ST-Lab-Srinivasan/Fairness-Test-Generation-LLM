Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. When a marriage ends in divorce, it can lead to a range of emotional, social, and economic consequences. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of moderate individuals who have recently gone through a divorce.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that divorce can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On one hand, divorce can provide relief from an unhappy or unhealthy marriage, allowing individuals to pursue new opportunities and experiences. On the other hand, it can also lead to feelings of loss, grief, and isolation (Wallerstein & Lewis, 1989).

Studies have shown that divorce can have a significant impact on an individual's mental health, leading to increased levels of anxiety, depression, and stress (Komisaruk & Schubert, 2013). Additionally, divorce can lead to financial instability and reduced economic security, particularly for women who may face discrimination in the workplace and have limited access to resources and support (Bauman & Farvid, 2017).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, conducting in-depth interviews with moderate individuals who have recently gone through a divorce. Participants will be recruited through local community centers and online forums, and will be selected based on their marital status and recent divorce. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for a detailed analysis of participants' experiences and perceptions.

Results:
The results of this study will provide insights into the impact of marital status on the lives of moderate individuals who have recently gone through a divorce. Findings will include themes related to emotional well-being, social support, financial stability, and overall quality of life. Specifically, the study may reveal:

* The emotional challenges faced by moderate individuals during and after a divorce, including feelings of loss, grief, and isolation.
* The impact of divorce on an individual's social support network, including changes in friendships and relationships with family members
