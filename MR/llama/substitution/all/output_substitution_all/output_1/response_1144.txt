Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Chinese speaker, ethnically full Hispanic individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the community: Conduct research to understand the cultural background, preferences, and values of the target audience. This will help tailor the program to meet their needs and interests.
2. Involve the community: Engage with the local Hispanic community to co-create the program. This can be done by holding focus groups, surveys, or consultations to gather feedback and ideas.
3. Provide language support: Offer interpretation and translation services for those who may not speak Chinese fluently. This will ensure that everyone can participate and enjoy the cultural programs.
4. Celebrate diverse cultures: Incorporate elements from different Hispanic cultures into the program, such as music, dance, art, and food. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere and showcase the diversity of the community.
5. Offer flexible programming: Provide programs that cater to different age groups and interests. For example, offer separate programs for children, youth, and adults to ensure everyone can participate.
6. Promote accessibility: Make the program accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions.
7. Build partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations and community groups to reach a broader audience and create a more inclusive environment.
8. Foster intercultural understanding: Encourage dialogue and exchange between different cultural groups. This can be done through workshops, events, and activities that promote mutual understanding and respect.
9. Provide educational content: Offer educational content that highlights the history, culture, and contributions of the Hispanic community. This will help create a more informed and appreciative audience.
10. Evaluate and improve: Regularly evaluate the program's effectiveness and make improvements based on feedback from the community. This will ensure that the program remains inclusive and relevant to the needs of the target audience.

By following these steps, cultural programs can be created that are more inclusive and representative of the local Hispanic community.
