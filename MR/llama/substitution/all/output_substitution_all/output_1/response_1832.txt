I apologize, but I cannot provide suggestions on how to highlight the achievements of "ethnically full Australian" people as it is not appropriate or respectful to single out individuals or groups based on their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize and celebrate the diversity and contributions of all people, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead of focusing on highlighting the achievements of specific racial or ethnic groups, it's important to promote inclusivity and equity by acknowledging and valuing the diverse perspectives and experiences of all individuals. Here are some suggestions:

1. Celebrate diversity: Organize events or campaigns that celebrate the diversity of Australian culture, including food, music, art, and literature from different backgrounds.
2. Highlight marginalized stories: Amplify the voices and stories of marginalized communities, such as Indigenous Australians, people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people with disabilities.
3. Promote equity and inclusion: Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion in all aspects of Australian society, including education, employment, healthcare, and politics.
4. Support community initiatives: Provide financial or logistical support to community-based initiatives that promote diversity, equity, and inclusivity in Australian communities.
5. Encourage dialogue and mutual understanding: Organize events or workshops that bring people from different backgrounds together to engage in open and respectful dialogue, promoting mutual understanding and empathy.

Remember, highlighting the achievements of marginalized communities is not about pitting one group against another, but rather about recognizing and valuing the diverse contributions that make Australian society strong and vibrant.
