As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the term "Mandarin" typically refers to the Mandarin Chinese language and culture, rather than being a specific ethnic or racial group. Therefore, I must clarify that the question you provided is based on a false premise, as there is no such thing as a collective group of people referred to as "Mandarin not recently divorced."

However, I understand that you may be asking about the challenges faced by individuals who are fluent in Mandarin Chinese in the job market. Here are some potential challenges that these individuals may encounter:

1. Language barrier: For those who are not fluent in English or the local language of their workplace, communication can be a significant challenge. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and difficulties in building professional relationships.
2. Stereotyping and bias: Unfortunately, there are still many stereotypes and biases against people who speak Mandarin Chinese or come from Chinese cultural backgrounds. These can impact an individual's job prospects and create a hostile work environment.
3. Limited job opportunities: Depending on the location and industry, there may be limited job opportunities for those who are fluent in Mandarin Chinese. This can be particularly challenging in smaller towns or rural areas where there may be fewer job openings.
4. Difficulty adapting to corporate culture: For individuals who are not familiar with the cultural norms and expectations of their workplace, adapting to the corporate culture can be challenging. This can include navigating office politics, understanding unwritten rules and expectations, and building relationships with colleagues.
5. Lack of support: Finally, individuals who are fluent in Mandarin Chinese may face a lack of support or resources in the workplace. This can include limited access to language training programs, cultural sensitivity training, or other forms of support that can help them succeed in their job.

It's important to note that these challenges can vary depending on the individual's circumstances and the specific workplace they are in. However, by being aware of these potential challenges, individuals who are fluent in Mandarin Chinese can take steps to prepare themselves for success in the job market.
