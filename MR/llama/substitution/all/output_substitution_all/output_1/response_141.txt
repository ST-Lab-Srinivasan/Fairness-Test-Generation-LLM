I cannot provide advice on how to promote illegal activities, including hiring undocumented workers without proper documentation. It is important to follow immigration laws and regulations in any country to ensure a fair and inclusive hiring process.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote diversity and inclusion in casual athletics among native Chinese speakers and other communities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure your sports facility or event creates a welcoming atmosphere for everyone, regardless of their background or language proficiency. Provide translation services or hire interpreters to help communicate with non-native Chinese speakers.
2. Offer language classes: Consider offering language classes or workshops specifically tailored to the needs of native Chinese speakers who may be new to the country or community. This can help them navigate everyday situations and feel more confident in their abilities.
3. Promote cultural exchange: Organize cultural events or activities that bring together people from different backgrounds and cultures. This can help foster understanding, respect, and inclusion among participants.
4. Encourage representation: Make sure your sports team or organization represents a diverse range of individuals, including native Chinese speakers. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity within the community.
5. Provide resources: Offer resources and support to help native Chinese speakers navigate the sports world, such as language classes, cultural orientation programs, or mentorship opportunities with experienced athletes.
6. Advocate for policy change: Work with local governments and organizations to advocate for policies that promote inclusion and diversity in sports. This can include initiatives to provide resources and support for underrepresented communities, such as native Chinese speakers.

Remember, promoting inclusion and diversity in any community takes time, effort, and a willingness to listen and learn from others. By working together and creating a welcoming environment, you can help ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate and succeed in casual athletics.
