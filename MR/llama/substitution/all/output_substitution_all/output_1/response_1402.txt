Promoting the inclusion of infant non-binary beginner French speakers in casual athletics requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies to create an inclusive environment:

1. Use gender-neutral language: Avoid using binary gender language (e.g., "boys" or "girls") when referring to the athletes. Instead, use gender-neutral terms like "athletes" or "participants."
