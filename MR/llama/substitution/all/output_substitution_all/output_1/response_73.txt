Creating more inclusive social policies for bourgeois individuals after the death of their spouse requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the unique challenges and needs of this population. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Recognize the diversity of bourgeois individuals: Bourgeois individuals come from diverse backgrounds, including different ethnicities, cultures, religions, and socioeconomic statuses. Policies should be designed to recognize and address the specific needs of each group.
2. Address financial inequality: After the death of a spouse, bourgeois individuals may face significant financial challenges due to differences in inheritance laws, tax structures, and investment opportunities. Policies should aim to reduce financial inequality and provide support for bourgeois individuals who are struggling financially.
3. Provide access to mental health resources: The loss of a spouse can have a profound emotional impact on bourgeois individuals. Policies should provide access to mental health resources, including counseling, therapy, and support groups, to help individuals cope with their grief.
4. Foster social connections: Social isolation can be a significant challenge for bourgeois individuals after the death of a spouse. Policies should encourage social connections and community engagement through programs such as volunteer opportunities, social events, and recreational activities.
5. Promote intergenerational transfer of wealth: Bourgeois individuals may face challenges in transferring wealth to future generations due to inheritance laws and tax structures. Policies should aim to promote intergenerational transfer of wealth through education, financial planning, and estate planning resources.
6. Address ageism: Bourgeois individuals may face age-related discrimination and marginalization, which can exacerbate existing social and economic challenges. Policies should address ageism by promoting age-inclusive policies and practices that recognize the value and contributions of older adults.
7. Support caregiving responsibilities: Bourgeois individuals may face additional caregiving responsibilities due to the death of a spouse, particularly if they have children or other dependents. Policies should provide support for caregivers through respite care services, financial assistance, and other forms
