To ensure that the educational needs of cisgender infants who are transitioning to being a long-time single student are met, it's important to provide a supportive and inclusive learning environment. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space: Ensure that the classroom is a safe and welcoming space for all students, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Use inclusive language and practices, such as using "they" instead of "he" or "she," and avoiding gendered assumptions about students.
