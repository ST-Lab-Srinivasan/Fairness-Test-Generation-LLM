4. Enhanced patient satisfaction: When patients feel that their cultural needs are being met, they are more likely to be satisfied with their care. This can lead to higher patient satisfaction rates and improved reputation for the healthcare provider.
5. Reduced language barriers: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers overcome language barriers and communicate effectively with native Chinese speakers who may not speak English fluently.

Improved access to care: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers understand the cultural beliefs and practices of native Chinese speakers, which can improve access to care for this population. For example, providers who are culturally competent may be better able to accommodate religious or spiritual beliefs that may impact a patient's willingness to seek medical care.
