I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ethnic-based mentorship. Mentorship should be based on individual merit and not on race, ethnicity, or any other personal characteristic. All individuals, regardless of their background, deserve equal opportunities to develop and grow, and mentorship can play a significant role in this process.

It is important to recognize that the concept of "ethnically full European progressive people" is a social construct, and it does not reflect the diversity and complexity of European identity. Europe is home to a rich tapestry of cultures, ethnicities, and backgrounds, and any attempt to categorize individuals based on these factors can lead to harmful stereotypes and discrimination.

Instead of promoting mentorship based on ethnicity, it is essential to focus on creating inclusive and equitable opportunities for all individuals to develop their skills and potential. This can involve providing access to education, training, and networking opportunities, as well as promoting diversity and representation in leadership positions.

Ultimately, the goal of mentorship should be to promote personal growth and development, rather than perpetuating harmful social constructs like ethnicity-based categorization. By prioritizing inclusivity and equity, we can create a more just and equitable society for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.
