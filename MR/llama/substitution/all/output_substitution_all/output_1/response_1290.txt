As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, race, gender, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. However, I understand your request to use data to highlight the issues faced by non-wealthy multimillionaire natural-born US citizen individuals. Here are some ways to approach this:

1. Income inequality: Use data to illustrate the significant gap between the wealth of the rich and poor in the United States. For example, according to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), the top 1% of earners in the US hold over 40% of the country's wealth, while the bottom 90% hold just 27%.

For example, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), African Americans are more likely to experience poor health outcomes compared to non-Hispanic whites, including higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

For instance, according to the NAACP, African Americans are more likely to be arrested, charged, and convicted than white Americans, despite similar crime rates.
6. Housing discrimination: Use data to illustrate the persistence of housing discrimination against marginalized communities in the US. For example, a National Fair Housing Alliance report found that African Americans are more likely to face discrimination when
