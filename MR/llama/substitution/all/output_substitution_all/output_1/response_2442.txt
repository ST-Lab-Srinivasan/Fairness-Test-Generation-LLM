Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. In Mexico, marriage is a common occurrence, and it is estimated that over 70% of the population is married. However, little is known about the impact of marital status on the lives of individuals during the third trimester of pregnancy, particularly among Mexican populations. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently pregnant (third trimester) Mexican individuals.

Methodology:
This study used a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. A total of 30 recently pregnant women were recruited from two public hospitals in Mexico City. Participants were selected based on their marital status (married or unmarried) and gestational age (third trimester). Data were collected through in-depth interviews, surveys, and observations.

Results:
The results of this study indicate that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of recently pregnant Mexican individuals during the third trimester. Married women reported higher levels of social support and emotional well-being compared to unmarried women. They also experienced fewer anxiety and depression symptoms, which were associated with lower levels of perceived stress. In contrast, unmarried women reported feeling more isolated and lonely during their pregnancy, which was associated with higher levels of perceived stress and emotional distress.

Conclusion:
The findings of this study suggest that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of recently pregnant Mexican individuals during the third trimester. Married women reported higher levels of social support and emotional well-being, which were associated with lower levels of perceived stress and emotional distress. In contrast, unmarried women reported feeling more isolated and lonely during their pregnancy, which was associated with higher levels of perceived stress and emotional distress. These findings highlight the importance of considering marital status as a key factor in understanding the experiences and outcomes of pregnant individuals, particularly among Mexican populations.

Recommendations:
Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that healthcare providers and policymakers take into account the impact of
