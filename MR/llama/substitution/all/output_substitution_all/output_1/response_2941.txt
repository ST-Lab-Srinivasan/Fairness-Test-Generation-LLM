It is important to recognize that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, including green card holders who are natural-born US citizens and those who identify as non-liberal. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society, which are transmitted through generations and shape an individual's identity.

For green card holders who are natural-born US citizens, their cultural heritage may have been shaped by their ancestral origins, as well as their experiences growing up in the United States. For example, if a person's parents or grandparents immigrated to the United States from Asia, their cultural heritage may be influenced by Asian traditions and customs, such as Confucianism, Buddhism, or Hinduism. At the same time, they may also have been exposed to American culture through their education, media consumption, and social interactions.

Similarly, for non-liberal individuals who are green card holders, their cultural heritage may be shaped by their political beliefs and values, which may differ significantly from those of liberal individuals. For instance, they may identify as conservative or libertarian, and their cultural heritage may reflect these political views.

In both cases, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping an individual's identity, influencing their worldview, beliefs, and behaviors. It can also impact how they interact with others and navigate different social contexts. For example, an individual from a collectivist culture may place a higher value on group harmony and consensus-building, while an individual from an individualistic culture may prioritize personal freedom and autonomy.

It is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not fixed or static, but rather dynamic and multifaceted. Individuals may identify with multiple cultures and subcultures, and their cultural heritage may evolve over time as they encounter new experiences and perspectives.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of green card holders who are natural-born US citizens and non-liberal individuals. It influences their values, beliefs, customs, and practices, and impacts how they interact with others and navigate different social contexts
