Supporting the mental health of someone in their first trimester of pregnancy, especially if they have recently experienced a breakup or loss, can be challenging but crucial. Here are some ways to provide emotional support:

1. Listen actively: Allow the person to express their feelings and thoughts without interrupting or judging. Active listening can help them feel heard and understood.
2. Validate their emotions: Acknowledge their feelings and validate their experience. Let them know that it's okay to feel upset, scared, or overwhelmed, and that you're there to support them.
