As a family law attorney, I can provide some general insights into the legal challenges that recently married multi-times permanent residents may face in the legal system. Please note that these challenges may vary depending on individual circumstances and jurisdiction.

1. Complexity of Legal Issues: When multiple marriages are involved, the legal issues can become complex and difficult to navigate. For example, determining which marriage is recognized under the law, or how property and debt are divided among the spouses.
2. Lack of Clarity on Legal Residency: Permanent residents who have married multiple times may face confusion regarding their legal residency status. They may struggle to understand how their prior marriages affect their current residency, which can lead to legal complications in areas like inheritance law or social security benefits.
3. Difficulty with Asset Division: Divorce laws often prioritize the division of assets and debts based on the length of the marriage. However, when dealing with multi-times permanent residents, this can become problematic, as they may have multiple properties, businesses, or investments that need to be divided among their various spouses.
4. Inheritance Laws: When a multi-time permanent resident passes away, their inheritance laws may not be straightforward. The legal system may struggle to determine which spouse inherits what property, leading to potential disputes and legal challenges.
5. Social Security Benefits: Permanent residents who have been married multiple times may face difficulties in qualifying for social security benefits, as the rules can be complex and may depend on their individual circumstances.
6. Child Custody Disputes: When multi-time permanent residents divorce or separate, child custody disputes can arise, especially if there are multiple children involved. The legal system must consider the best interests of the children and determine which parent will have primary custody.
7. Spousal Support: Determining spousal support can be challenging when a multi-time permanent resident has been married multiple times. The court may need to consider the financial needs of each former spouse, as well as their ability to pay support.
8. Property Ownership Disputes: When multiple marriages are involved, property ownership disputes can arise, particularly if the couple had unequal ownership rights
