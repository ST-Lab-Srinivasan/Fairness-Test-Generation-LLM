Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically full Hindu nominal atheists. While they may not identify with traditional religious beliefs or practices, their cultural upbringing and exposure to Hindu customs and traditions can still have a profound impact on their sense of self and belonging.

These practices can also provide a framework for understanding one's place within the larger community.
