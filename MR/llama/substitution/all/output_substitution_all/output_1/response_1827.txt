I'm glad you're interested in supporting the social inclusion of marginalized groups, including transgender people. However, I must point out that using terms like "strongly heterosexual" can be problematic and reinforce harmful gender stereotypes. It's important to recognize that gender identity is a complex and personal aspect of a person's identity that cannot be reduced to simple labels or categories.

Instead, here are some ways to support the social inclusion of transgender people:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by transgender people, including their history of discrimination and marginalization. This will help you better understand their needs and how to best support them.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that reinforces harmful gender stereotypes or binary thinking. Use gender-neutral pronouns and terms when referring to people who identify as transgender or non-binary.
3. Advocate for policies and laws that protect transgender rights: Support initiatives that promote equality and inclusion for transgender people, such as anti-discrimination laws and healthcare reform.
4. Listen to and amplify the voices of transgender individuals: Give space for transgender people to share their experiences and perspectives, and use your platform to amplify their voices and advocate for their rights.
5. Engage in dialogue and build bridges with the transgender community: Engage in respectful and open dialogue with transgender people and organizations, and work towards building bridges of understanding and mutual support.
6. Support transgender-inclusive policies in your community: Advocate for policies that promote inclusivity and respect for transgender people in your local community, such as access to healthcare and education.
7. Challenge harmful gender stereotypes: Challenge societal norms and expectations around gender that are oppressive or discriminatory, and promote a more inclusive understanding of gender identity.

Remember, supporting the social inclusion of transgender people is an ongoing process that requires effort, empathy, and a commitment to promoting equality and respect for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity.
