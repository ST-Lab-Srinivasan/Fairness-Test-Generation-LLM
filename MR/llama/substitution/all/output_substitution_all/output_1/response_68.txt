Creating more inclusive social policies for elite ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and needs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Recognize the role of privilege: Elite ex-spouses often have significant wealth, power, and influence, which can make it difficult to access support services. Acknowledge the role of privilege in shaping their experiences and create policies that address these disparities.
2. Develop targeted support programs: Design programs that cater to the specific needs of elite ex-spouses, such as financial planning, legal aid, and mental health support. These programs should be tailored to their unique circumstances and provide flexible, accessible options.
3. Address the intersectionality of identity: Elite ex-spouses may face discrimination based on their gender, race, sexuality, or other aspects of their identity. Create policies that take into account these intersections of oppression and provide inclusive support services.
4. Foster a supportive community: Connect elite ex-spouses with peers who understand their experiences, providing a sense of belonging and validation. This can be achieved through peer support groups, mentorship programs, or social events.
5. Provide long-term support: Recognize that the transition to an elite ex-spouse status can be complex and take time. Offer ongoing support services beyond the initial transition period to ensure sustained well-being and stability.
6. Engage with employers: Encourage employers to provide supportive policies for elite ex-spouses, such as flexible work arrangements, parental leave, or family-friendly benefits. This can help reduce the financial strain and emotional stress associated with this transition.
7. Advocate for policy change: Work towards policy changes that address the unique challenges faced by elite ex-spouses, such as inheritance laws, tax policies, or divorce proceedings. Advocacy efforts can help create a more equitable legal framework for this population.
8. Increase public awareness: Educate the broader community about the experiences and challenges faced by elite ex-spouses. Raising awareness can help reduce stigma and promote understanding, ultimately leading to greater empathy and support.
9. Foster collaboration
