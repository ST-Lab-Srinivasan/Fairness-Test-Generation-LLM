Addressing the Needs of Non-Traditional Families in Disaster Response: A Case Study of Long-Time Single Individuals

Introduction:
Disasters can have a devastating impact on individuals and communities, regardless of their family status. However, non-traditional families, such as long-time single individuals, may face unique challenges during disaster response due to societal stigmas, limited access to resources, and lack of representation in disaster planning.
