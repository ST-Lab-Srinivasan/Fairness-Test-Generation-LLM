Creating inclusive community programs for natural-born Middle Eastern citizens who are long-term, recently married individuals requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs of the community: Conduct research to identify the specific needs and challenges faced by this community group. This could include gathering data on their demographic characteristics, cultural practices, language proficiency, and access to resources.
2. Develop a comprehensive program plan: Based on your research, create a program plan that addresses the identified needs of the community. The plan should include specific goals, objectives, and strategies for delivering services and support.

This could include recruiting community members as program facilitators, advisors, or volunteers.
