Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Beginner Spanish Speakers After Loss

Introduction:
Losing a spouse can be a traumatic experience, and it often leads to significant changes in an individual's life. One aspect that can be affected is their cultural identity, particularly for those who are recent widows or widowers of Spanish speakers. This paper aims to investigate the role that cultural heritage plays in shaping the identities of beginner Spanish speakers after loss.

Theoretical Framework:
This study draws on the concept of cultural heritage, which refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices of a particular group or society (Kuhn, 2007). Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and identity, especially during times of loss and change. However, the process of grieving and adjusting to life without a spouse can also lead to a re-evaluation of cultural beliefs and practices.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, with in-depth interviews conducted with beginner Spanish speakers who have experienced the loss of their spouses. Participants will be recruited through local grief support groups and online forums. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather data on participants' experiences, including their cultural heritage, grieving process, and identity formation after loss.

Data Analysis:
The interview data will be analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). This method allows for the identification of patterns and themes within the data, enabling a deeper understanding of the participants' experiences. The findings will be organized around the following themes: cultural heritage and identity, grieving process, and adjusting to life without a spouse.

Expected Findings:
It is expected that cultural heritage will play a significant role in shaping the identities of beginner Spanish speakers after loss. Participants may draw upon their cultural background to make sense of their loss and to find meaning in their grieving process. For example, some participants may find comfort in traditional mourning practices or rituals from their culture of origin. Conversely, they may experience conflict between their cultural heritage and the expectations of their new social environment
