Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, particularly for beginner English speakers who are recently immigrated to the US. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this population:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers communicate more effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds. By understanding the patient's cultural values, beliefs, and practices, providers can tailor their communication style to better meet the patient's needs.
