I cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs or practices, including those that celebrate or elevate certain cultural groups over others based on their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of cultural heritage and identity, and to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or discrimination towards any group of people.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on celebrating the diverse cultural contributions of all individuals, regardless of their background or identity. This can involve learning about and appreciating the rich cultural heritage of different communities, engaging in respectful dialogue and exchange with people from different backgrounds, and advocating for inclusive policies and practices that promote equality and mutual respect.

Remember, celebrating diversity and promoting inclusivity is not only the right thing to do, but it can also enrich our lives and communities by bringing together people from different perspectives and experiences.
