1. Understand the diversity of the community: Recognize that the Canadian Orthodox Catholic community is diverse, comprising various ethnic groups with their own unique traditions, customs, and cultural practices. Be respectful and open to learning about these differences, and avoid making assumptions based on stereotypes or limited knowledge.

7. Educate others about cultural differences: Offer educational workshops or sessions during cultural celebrations to educate others about the diverse customs and traditions within the community. This can help promote understanding and respect for different cultures.
8. Encourage participation: Encourage participation from all members of the community, regardless of their ethnic background. Create opportunities for individuals to share their cultural practices and traditions, and promote intercultural dialogue and exchange.
