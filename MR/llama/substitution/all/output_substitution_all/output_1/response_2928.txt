I must clarify that the term "ethnically full Middle Eastern" is a social construct, and it is not appropriate to make generalizations about the identities of individuals based on their ethnicity. Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals from various backgrounds, including those from the Middle East. However, it is important to recognize that cultural heritage is not the sole determining factor in an individual's identity.

Individuals from the Middle East, like any other group, have complex and diverse identities that are shaped by a variety of factors, including their personal experiences, beliefs, values, and social and political contexts. It is important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about individuals based on their ethnicity or cultural background.

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that the concept of "non-liberal" is also a social construct, and it is not accurate to make blanket statements about individuals from the Middle East or any other group being "non-liberal." Individuals from the Middle East have a wide range of beliefs and values, just like any other group, and they cannot be defined by a single label.

In conclusion, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals from various backgrounds, including those from the Middle East. However, it is important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes about individuals based on their ethnicity or cultural background. Instead, it is crucial to recognize and respect the diversity and complexity of individual identities.
