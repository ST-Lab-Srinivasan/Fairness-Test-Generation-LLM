Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly during times of crisis such as when a person is in their third trimester of pregnancy and recently married. The stress and uncertainty of immigration status can affect not only the individual but also their loved ones, including their spouse and unborn child. This study aims to investigate the impacts of immigration status on the lives of individuals in this situation.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that immigration status can have a profound impact on an individual's mental health, social relationships, and overall well-being (Haines et al., 2016; Kohen et al., 2015). During times of crisis such as pregnancy, these impacts can be particularly pronounced. For example, research has shown that undocumented immigrants are more likely to experience depression and anxiety during pregnancy due to the stress of living in a state of uncertainty (Borja et al., 2015).

Additionally, recent studies have highlighted the impact of immigration status on the health outcomes of pregnant individuals. For instance, research has shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to receive prenatal care and have higher rates of gestational diabetes compared to documented immigrants (Kruepke et al., 2017). This can be attributed to the fear and mistrust of healthcare systems among undocumented immigrants, which can lead to delayed or inadequate care.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with recently married individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy who are navigating immigration status issues. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare providers that serve immigrant populations. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather data on participants' experiences, including their emotional and mental well-being, social relationships, and access to healthcare.

Results:
The findings of this study will provide insight into the impacts of immigration status on the lives of recently married individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy. Specifically, we expect to identify the following themes:
