Ensuring the healthcare needs of recent refugees in India, particularly those from low-income backgrounds, is crucial for their overall wellbeing and integration into society. Here are some strategies that can help meet their healthcare needs:

1. Accessible Healthcare Facilities: Establishing healthcare facilities near refugee settlements or in areas where they congregate can increase accessibility. These facilities should be staffed by trained medical professionals who speak the refugees' native languages and are familiar with their cultural practices.
2. Mobile Medical Units: Deploying mobile medical units to reach remote refugee populations can provide basic healthcare services, including vaccinations, check-ups, and emergency care. These units should be equipped with necessary medical supplies and staffed by qualified healthcare professionals.
3. Community Health Workers: Training community health workers (CHWs) from the local population can help reach refugees who may not have access to formal healthcare services. CHWs can provide basic first aid, conduct home visits, and connect refugees with formal healthcare providers when needed.
4. Refugee-Friendly Insurance: Developing insurance schemes that cater specifically to the healthcare needs of refugees can help cover the costs of medical care. These schemes should be affordable, flexible, and accessible to all refugees, regardless of their income level.
5. Capacity Building: Providing capacity building opportunities for refugee healthcare workers can help build a stronger and more sustainable healthcare workforce in India. This can include training programs in various medical specialties, as well as leadership and management skills.
6. Partnerships with NGOs: Collaborating with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that specialize in refugee healthcare can help leverage their expertise and resources to provide better care for low-income refugees. These partnerships can also facilitate knowledge sharing, capacity building, and joint program implementation.
7. Outreach Programs: Organizing outreach programs that bring healthcare services directly to refugee communities can help address the specific healthcare needs of these populations. These programs can include mobile clinics, health fairs, and community events.
8. Psychosocial Support: Providing psychosocial support to refuge
