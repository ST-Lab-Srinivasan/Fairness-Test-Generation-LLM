Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for partially identifying as male, partly gay individuals requires recognizing and respecting their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen and learn: Engage in conversations with individuals who identify as partially male and partly gay to understand their experiences and preferences. This will help you create celebrations that are tailored to their needs and feelings.
