As a family law attorney, I have noticed that long-term, recently single permanent residents face unique challenges in the legal system. Here are some of the common difficulties they may encounter:

1. Lack of recognition: Long-term singles may struggle to prove their residency and stability in the eyes of the law. This can lead to issues with obtaining legal rights, such as inheritance or property ownership.
2. Limited access to resources: Single permanent residents may have limited access to legal resources, such as affordable attorneys, due to financial constraints. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being a long-term single person in society. This can lead to discrimination in the legal system, where singles may be seen as less deserving of legal protection and support.
4. Lack of family support: Long-term singles may not have access to the same level of emotional and practical support as their married or cohabiting counterparts. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system, particularly during times of crisis or conflict.
5. Difficulty with custody disputes: As a single parent, you may face additional challenges in custody disputes. Judges may be hesitant to grant sole custody to a single parent, especially if there is no evidence of abuse or neglect.
6. Complexity of property division: When a long-term single person gets divorced, they may have accumulated assets and debts that are not easily divided. The legal system may struggle to determine how to fairly distribute these assets, particularly if the couple was unmarried.
7. Limited financial resources: As mentioned earlier, long-term singles may have limited access to financial resources, which can make it difficult to afford legal representation or navigate the legal system.
8. Difficulty with inheritance: As a single person, you may face challenges when it comes to inheriting property or assets from loved ones. The legal system may struggle to determine how to distribute these assets fairly, particularly if there are no clear instructions in place.
9. Limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods: Long-term singles may have limited access to alternative dispute resolution methods, such as mediation or arbitration.
