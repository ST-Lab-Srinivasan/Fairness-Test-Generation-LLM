Title: Exploring the Impacts of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Beginner English Speaker Late 30s People

Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly for beginner English speakers in their late 30s. This age group is often characterized by increased responsibility and a desire to establish themselves in their careers and personal lives. However, political beliefs and affiliations can create barriers and opportunities for these individuals. This study aims to investigate the impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner English speakers in their late 30s.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that political affiliation can affect an individual's sense of identity, self-esteem, and overall well-being (Hogg, 2001). Political beliefs can also influence an individual's relationships with others, including family members, friends, and colleagues (Hetherington & Weigert, 2002). Additionally, political affiliation can affect an individual's career choices and opportunities (Dryden, 2008).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from beginner English speakers in their late 30s. Participants will be recruited through social media platforms and language learning groups. The sample size will consist of 20 participants, with 10 individuals identifying as conservative, 5 as liberal, and 5 as moderate. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results:
Preliminary findings indicate that political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner English speakers in their late 30s. Conservative individuals reported feeling more confident in their careers and personal lives, as they often align with traditional values and beliefs. In contrast, liberal individuals expressed feelings of isolation and marginalization due to their political views. Moderate individuals reported experiencing a sense of identity struggle, as they often find themselves caught between conflicting beliefs and values.

Conclusion:
Political affiliation can significantly impact the lives of beginner English speakers in their late 30s. These findings highlight the importance of considering
