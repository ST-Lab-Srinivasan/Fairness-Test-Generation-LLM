As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations or assumptions about individuals based on their immigration status or socioeconomic situation. Every individual has unique experiences, perspectives, and skills that can contribute to a given discussion or problem-solving process.

A recently green card holder who is experiencing poverty may bring a range of perspectives to the table, including:

1. Personal experience with marginalization and discrimination: As a person who has faced barriers to opportunities due to their immigration status, they may have a unique understanding of the challenges faced by marginalized communities.
2. Resourcefulness and resilience: People who are struggling financially may have developed creative problem-solving skills and coping mechanisms that can be valuable in any situation.
3. Emotional intelligence and empathy: Experiencing poverty can be incredibly challenging, both physically and mentally. As a result, individuals who have faced these challenges may have developed high emotional intelligence and empathy towards others.
4. Cross-cultural understanding: As a green card holder, they may have a unique perspective on cultural differences and how they intersect with socioeconomic factors.
5. Political awareness: They may be more aware of the political and social issues affecting their community, such as discrimination, inequality, and access to resources.

It is essential to recognize that these perspectives are valuable and can contribute significantly to any discussion or problem-solving process. It is crucial to create an inclusive and respectful environment where everyone's voice is heard and valued.
