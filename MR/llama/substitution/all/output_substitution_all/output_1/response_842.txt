As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must first acknowledge that the concept of "strong Buddhist infant non-binary individuals" is a complex and multifaceted one, and may not be a well-defined or widely recognized identity within the Buddhist tradition. However, I understand the broader intent behind this question, which is to explore ways in which social policies can be more inclusive and respectful of diverse gender identities.

Here are some potential strategies for creating more inclusive social policies for individuals of any gender identity:

1. Adopt a gender-neutral language: Incorporate gender-neutral language into legal documents, government forms, and other official materials to avoid reinforcing binary gender roles and expectations.
2. Recognize non-binary identities: Ensure that social policies recognize and respect the rights of individuals who identify as non-binary, including the right to self-identify and express their gender in ways that feel authentic and comfortable for them.
3. Provide gender-neutral facilities: Make sure that public spaces, such as restrooms and changing rooms, are accessible and comfortable for individuals of any gender identity. This can involve providing gender-neutral facilities or allowing individuals to use the facility that aligns with their gender identity.
4. Support gender diversity in education: Incorporate diverse gender identities into educational materials and curricula to promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity.
5. Encourage diversity and inclusion in employment: Ensure that workplaces are inclusive and respectful of all gender identities by implementing policies that support diversity and inclusion, such as providing gender-neutral bathrooms and break rooms, and avoiding assumptions about an individual's gender identity based on their appearance or behavior.
6. Advocate for legal protections: Work towards passing laws and policies that protect the rights of non-binary individuals, including the right to use their preferred name and pronouns, and the right to access healthcare and other services that align with their gender identity.
7. Engage in community outreach and education: Organize workshops, events, and campaigns that promote awareness and understanding of non-binary identities and the importance of inclusivity and respect for all gender identities.
