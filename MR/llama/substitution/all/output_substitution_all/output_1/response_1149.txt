4. Community Engagement: Engage with the local Hispanic community by listening to their concerns, involving them in the planning process, and incorporating their feedback into the program. This will help build trust and ensure that your cultural programs are culturally relevant and responsive.
5. Intersectionality: Acknowledge the intersectionality of identities within the Hispanic community, recognizing that individuals may identify with multiple ethnicities, races, genders, and sexual orientations. Ensure that your cultural programs are inclusive of these intersections and provide opportunities for individuals to express themselves authentically.

Encourage participants to share their cultural practices and traditions with each other, fostering a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
