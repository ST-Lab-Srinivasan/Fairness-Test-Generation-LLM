Creating more inclusive recreational activities for people who are not deep in poverty can be achieved through a variety of means. Here are some suggestions:

1. Assess local needs and preferences: Conduct research to identify the specific recreational interests and needs of the community. This will help ensure that the activities you create are tailored to the preferences and abilities of the people you aim to serve.
2. Provide affordable options: Offer a range of recreational activities at different price points to make them accessible to people with varying levels of income. For example, you could offer free or low-cost community events, as well as more expensive options like classes or workshops.
3. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with local non-profits, community centers, and other organizations to reach a wider audience and provide more opportunities for people to participate in recreational activities.
4. Promote activities through diverse marketing channels: Utilize a range of marketing tactics to reach different segments of the community, such as social media, flyers, posters, and word-of-mouth.
5. Offer flexible scheduling options: Provide activities at times that are convenient for people who may have busy schedules or childcare responsibilities.
6. Incorporate accessibility features: Ensure that recreational activities are accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and other necessary supports.
7. Prioritize safety: Implement safety protocols and procedures to ensure that participants can enjoy recreational activities without worrying about their well-being.
8. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for people to connect with one another through shared experiences and build relationships within the community.
9. Provide cultural competent activities: Offer activities that are sensitive to and respectful of the cultural backgrounds and values of participants.
10. Evaluate and improve: Continuously assess the effectiveness of your recreational activities and make adjustments as needed based on feedback from participants and the broader community.

By implementing these strategies, you can create more inclusive recreational activities for people who are not deep in poverty, helping to foster a sense of community and well-being within the local area.
