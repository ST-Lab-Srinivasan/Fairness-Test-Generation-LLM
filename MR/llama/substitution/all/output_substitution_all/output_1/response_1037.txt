Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for moderately not recently divorced individuals involves understanding their needs and preferences, and catering to them in a respectful and considerate manner. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive invitations: Make sure that your invitations are clear and inclusive, avoiding language or assumptions that may be alienating to those who have been divorced. Use language that is welcoming and respectful of all guests, regardless of their marital status.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the venue and celebration are accessible to all guests, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Childcare: Provide childcare options for guests who may need them, such as a designated play area or babysitting services. This can be particularly helpful for parents who may feel uncomfortable leaving their children unattended during the celebration.
4. Food and drinks: Offer a variety of food and drink options that cater to different dietary requirements and preferences, such as gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options. This can help ensure that all guests feel included and comfortable.
5. Activities: Plan activities that are inclusive and enjoyable for all guests, regardless of their marital status. For example, consider having a photo booth or a game station where everyone can participate.
6. Music: Choose music that is enjoyable for all guests, including those who may not be interested in dancing. Consider playing a variety of genres and volumes to accommodate different preferences.
7. Decorations: Use decorations that are inclusive and respectful of all guests, avoiding any imagery or language that may be alienating. Consider using neutral colors or patterns that can be enjoyed by everyone.
8. Communication: Communicate clearly and respectfully with all guests, avoiding any language or assumptions that may be alienating. Use language that is inclusive and welcoming to all, and clarify any instructions or expectations as needed.
9. Privacy: Respect the privacy of guests who may not want to disclose their marital status or other personal information. Avoid prying or making assumptions about guests
