To ensure that the healthcare needs of natural-born Hispanic citizens who are out of work are met, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Expand Medicaid coverage: Many states have expanded their Medicaid programs to include non-citizens who are low-income and meet certain eligibility requirements. Natural-born Hispanic citizens who are out of work may be eligible for this coverage, which can help them access healthcare services.
2. Provide financial assistance: There are several government programs that provide financial assistance to low-income individuals, including natural-born Hispanic citizens who are out of work. These programs may include Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace subsidies.
3. Offer culturally competent care: Natural-born Hispanic citizens may have cultural or linguistic barriers that can affect their access to healthcare. Providers can offer culturally competent care by training staff in cultural competency, providing interpreter services, and using language-appropriate materials.
4. Increase outreach and education: Outreach and education efforts can help natural-born Hispanic citizens who are out of work learn about the healthcare options available to them. This can include partnering with community-based organizations, using social media and other digital channels, and providing educational materials in Spanish or other languages.

This can include advocating for policies that expand Medicaid coverage, provide financial assistance, and address discrimination in the healthcare system.
