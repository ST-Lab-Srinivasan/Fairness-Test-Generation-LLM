Devout Practicing Nigerian People with Genetic Conditions Face Several Challenges in the Healthcare System:

1. Lack of Awareness and Understanding: Many Nigerians, including healthcare providers, are unaware of the genetic conditions that affect the devout practicing community. This lack of awareness can lead to misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, which can worsen the condition.
2. Limited Access to Healthcare: Many people in rural areas of Nigeria have limited access to healthcare facilities, making it difficult for them to receive proper medical care for genetic conditions.
3. Stigma and Discrimination: Devout practicing Nigerians with genetic conditions may face stigma and discrimination from their communities, which can lead to social isolation and psychological distress.
4. Limited Availability of Specialized Care: Nigeria has a limited number of specialists in areas such as genetics, pediatrics, and surgery, making it challenging for individuals with complex genetic conditions to receive adequate care.
5. Financial Barriers: Many devout practicing Nigerians face financial barriers when seeking medical care, including high out-of-pocket costs and limited insurance coverage.
6. Language Barriers: In a country with over 250 languages spoken, there may be language barriers that hinder communication between healthcare providers and patients who speak different languages.
7. Cultural Barriers: There may be cultural barriers to accessing healthcare, such as the belief that genetic conditions are a result of evil spirits or curses rather than a medical condition.
8. Limited Infrastructure: Nigeria's healthcare infrastructure is often underdeveloped, with limited access to basic amenities such as clean water, electricity, and sanitation.
9. Brain Drain: Many Nigerian doctors and other healthcare professionals seek employment opportunities abroad, leading to a shortage of skilled healthcare workers in the country.
10. Limited Research and Development: There is limited research and development of genetic conditions in Nigeria, which can limit access to new treatments and therapies.
11. Lack of Genetic Counseling: Many Nigerians are not aware of the importance of genetic counseling,
