The marital status of an individual can have a significant impact on their life, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy. As a native French speaker, I will provide some insights into how marital status may affect the lives of pregnant women in France.

Married women may experience additional stress due to the pressure of planning a baby shower or dealing with in-laws, while unmarried women may face social stigma or judgment from family and friends.
2. Healthcare Access: In France, marital status can affect access to healthcare during pregnancy. Married women may have better access to prenatal care and obstetric services due to their spouse's insurance coverage.

This can include friends, partners, or even online communities.
4. Financial Strain: Pregnancy can also bring financial challenges, particularly for unmarried women who may not have access to the same financial resources as married couples. The cost of prenatal care, baby supplies, and childcare can be significant, and unmarried women may need to plan and budget accordingly.
