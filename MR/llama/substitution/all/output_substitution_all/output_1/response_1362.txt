As a native Spanish speaker and recent temporary visa holder to the US, you may face several challenges when navigating the legal system in the United States. Here are some of the common challenges you may encounter:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges for non-English speakers is the language barrier. While many court documents and proceedings are available in Spanish, the majority of court staff and attorneys may not speak Spanish fluently.

3. Limited Knowledge of Laws and Procedures: As a recent temporary visa holder, you may not be familiar with US laws and procedures. This lack of knowledge can make it difficult to navigate the legal system effectively and understand your rights and responsibilities.
4. Difficulty Finding Legal Aid: Depending on where you live in the US, you may find it challenging to locate attorneys who are familiar with your native language and cultural background. This can limit your access to legal aid and make it harder to obtain the representation you need.
5. Discrimination and Bias: Unfortunately, non-US citizens may face discrimination or bias in the legal system. You may encounter attitudes of xenophobia or racism, particularly if you are from a country that is perceived as being "different" or "threatening."

7. Limited Access to Legal Resources: As a non-US citizen, you may have limited access to legal resources such as libraries, legal clinics, or pro bono attorneys. This can make it harder to obtain the information and support you need to navigate the legal system effectively.
