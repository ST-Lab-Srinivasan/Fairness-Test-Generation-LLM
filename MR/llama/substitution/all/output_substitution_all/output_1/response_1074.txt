Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native natural-born US citizen devout Christians. Here are some ways:

1. Traditions and Practices: Cultural heritage influences the way Native Americans practice their faith. For example, many Native American tribes have their own unique traditions and practices that are rooted in their history and cultural beliefs.
