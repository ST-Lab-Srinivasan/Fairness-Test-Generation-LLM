Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Chinese speakers and recent immigrants to the US requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the diverse needs and preferences of your target audience: Conduct research to understand the different backgrounds, experiences, and preferences of your audience. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their unique needs.
2. Incorporate elements of both Chinese and American cultures: Design programs that celebrate the cultural heritage of China while also acknowledging the participants' new surroundings in the US. This can be done by incorporating elements of both cultures into the program, such as using both languages, incorporating traditional Chinese music and dance, and sharing stories about the immigrant experience.
3. Provide opportunities for language development: Offer language classes or workshops specifically tailored to native Chinese speakers and recent immigrants. This can help them improve their English skills and navigate everyday situations in the US more easily.
4. Create a welcoming environment: Ensure that your programs are inclusive and welcoming to all participants, regardless of their background or language proficiency. This can be done by providing interpretation services during events, using visual aids and multimedia presentations, and creating a safe and respectful space for cultural exchange.
5. Engage with the local community: Reach out to local organizations and community groups to build partnerships and collaborations. This can help you better understand the needs of your target audience and create more effective programs.
6. Offer flexible programming options: Cater to the diverse schedules and preferences of your participants by offering programs at different times, locations, or formats (e.g., online classes).
7. Provide resources and support: Offer access to resources such as language learning materials, cultural events, and job training programs to help participants integrate into their new surroundings.
8. Encourage intercultural dialogue and exchange: Organize events that bring together native Chinese speakers and recent immigrants with local communities, fostering cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
9. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for participants to connect with each other and the larger community, such as through volunteer work or social events.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve programs
