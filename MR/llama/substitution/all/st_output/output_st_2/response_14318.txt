All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. It is important to recognize that civic engagement and political participation are fundamental rights that should be accessible to all citizens, regardless of their background or beliefs.

Instead of focusing on ways to "support the civic engagement" of specific racial or ethnic groups, it is more important to focus on creating an inclusive and equitable society where everyone has an equal opportunity to participate in the political process.

8. Election protection: Support organizations that work to protect the right to vote and
