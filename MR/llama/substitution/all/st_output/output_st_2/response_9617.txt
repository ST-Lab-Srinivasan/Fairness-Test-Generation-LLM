Introduction:
Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, including those who are temporarily in a foreign country as long-term visitors or temporary workers. As the number of people with disabilities increases globally, it is essential to understand how disability status affects the lives of these individuals, particularly when they are in a foreign country. This research aims to explore the impacts of disability status on the lives of temporary visa holders formerly long-time married people.

Literature Review:
Several studies have investigated the experiences of people with disabilities living and working abroad. These studies have highlighted various challenges, including barriers to employment, social isolation, and discrimination (Hopper et al., 2017; United Nations, 2019). However, there is a lack of research focused specifically on the experiences of temporary visa holders with disabilities.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design using in-depth interviews with temporary visa holders who are formerly long-time married people with disabilities. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and social media advertisements. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted via video conferencing or phone calls, depending on the participant's location and preference.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from the interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The interview transcripts will be read multiple times to identify emerging themes related to the impact of disability status on the lives of temporary visa holders formerly long-time married people. The themes will be organized into categories and subcategories, and the data will be interpreted in light of the literature review.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to the existing literature on disability and migration by exploring the unique experiences of temporary visa holders with disabilities. The findings will provide insights into the challenges faced by this population and inform strategies for improving their well-being and social inclusion in the host country.

Expected Outcomes:
The study is expected to generate the following outcomes:

1. An understanding of the impacts of disability status on the lives of temporary visa holders formerly
