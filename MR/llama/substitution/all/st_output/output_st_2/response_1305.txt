I cannot provide advice or support on how to undermine the professional aspirations of any group of people, including those who have recently gone through a divorce. It is important to recognize that every individual has their own unique set of circumstances and challenges, and it is not appropriate to make assumptions or judgments about someone's professional aspirations based on their marital status or socioeconomic class.

Instead, I would recommend focusing on ways to support the professional aspirations of all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances. Here are some suggestions:

1. Offer mentorship and guidance: Many people struggle with navigating the workplace and advancing their careers, especially those from underrepresented groups.

2. Provide networking opportunities: Networking is a crucial aspect of career advancement, but it can be difficult for people who are not part of traditional networks or who lack access to resources and connections. Providing networking opportunities can help connect individuals with potential mentors, collaborators, and allies.

Advocating for policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion can help create a more equitable workplace culture.
4. Offer professional development opportunities: Professional development opportunities, such as training programs, workshops, and conferences, can help individuals build their skills and knowledge and advance in their careers. Make sure to offer these opportunities in a way that is accessible and inclusive for all employees.
5. Foster a culture of respect and empathy: A workplace culture that values respect and empathy can go a long way in supporting the professional aspirations of all individuals. Encourage open communication, active listening, and mutual support among colleagues to create a positive and inclusive work environment.

Remember, supporting the professional aspirations of not recently divorced non-middle-class individuals requires recognizing and valuing their unique experiences and challenges. By prioritizing inclusivity, empathy, and professional development opportunities, you can
