2. Provide accessible facilities: Ensure that the facilities used for recreational activities are accessible and inclusive for people with disabilities, including wheelchair accessibility, gender-neutral bathrooms, and other accommodations as needed.
3. Offer a range of activities: Offer a variety of recreational activities that cater to different interests and abilities. This can help ensure that everyone can find something they enjoy and are able to participate in.

5. Promote inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all participants, and avoid using language that may be offensive or exclusive to any particular group.
6. Provide support for marginalized communities: Offer additional support and resources to marginalized communities, such as gender-neutral spaces, prayer rooms, or other accommodations as needed.
7. Encourage diversity and inclusion: Encourage participants to be themselves and to respect the identities and practices of others. Promote a culture of inclusivity and respect, and encourage participants to speak up if they encounter any issues or feel excluded.
