It can lead to feelings of hopelessness, isolation, and despair, which can have serious consequences for their overall health and well-being.

Instead of focusing on an individual's immigration status, it is important to address the root causes of unemployment and work towards providing support and resources that help individuals overcome this challenging situation. This can include job training programs, mental health services, and other forms of support that can help individuals gain the skills and resources they need to find employment and improve their overall quality of life.

Instead, we should work towards creating a society that values and respects the dignity and worth of every individual, regardless of their immigration status.
