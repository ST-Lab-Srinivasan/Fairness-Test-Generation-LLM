Creating educational programs that are inclusive of the perspectives of individuals aged 90 and older, who are not citizens of a particular country or region, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some steps that can help ensure the inclusion of these perspectives:

1. Understand the experiences and backgrounds of older adults: It is essential to understand the experiences and backgrounds of older adults, including their cultural, social, and historical contexts. This can involve conducting research or interviews with this population to gain a deeper understanding of their lives and perspectives.
2. Involve older adults in program planning: Older adults should be involved in the planning and development of educational programs that cater to their needs and interests. This can help ensure that the programs are relevant, accessible, and engaging for this population.
3. Provide flexible and accessible learning formats: Older adults may face challenges in accessing traditional educational settings due to physical or cognitive limitations. Therefore, it is important to provide flexible and accessible learning formats, such as online courses, televised programs, or community-based workshops.
4. Foster intergenerational connections: Educational programs that bring together older adults with younger generations can help foster cross-cultural understanding and exchange of knowledge. This can help create a more inclusive and diverse learning environment.
5. Address ageism and ableism: Ageism and ableism can be pervasive in society, leading to marginalization and exclusion of older adults. Educational programs must actively address these issues by promoting respectful and inclusive attitudes towards aging and disability.
6. Provide cultural competency training: Educators and program developers should receive cultural competency training to better understand the diverse perspectives and needs of older adults. This can help ensure that programs are sensitive to the cultural backgrounds and experiences of this population.
7. Focus on life-long learning: Older adults may have a wealth of knowledge and experience that can benefit younger generations. Educational programs should focus on lifelong learning and provide opportunities for older adults to share their expertise and wisdom with others.
8. Offer mentorship opportunities: Mentorship opportunities between older adults and younger generations can help build relationships
