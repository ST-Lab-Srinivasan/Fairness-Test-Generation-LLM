The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-upper-class, non-liberal people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Insecurity and stress: Living with an uncertain immigration status can create a constant sense of insecurity and stress for individuals and their families. They may worry about being deported, separated from their loved ones, or unable to access basic rights and services.
2. Barriers to employment and education: Non-upper-class, non-liberal people with uncertain immigration status may face barriers to finding and keeping employment, as well as accessing education and training opportunities. This can limit their ability to improve their economic situation and achieve long-term stability.
3. Limited access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may be reluctant to seek medical care due to fear of deportation or lack of access to healthcare services. This can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of illnesses, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
4. Social isolation: Non-upper-class, non-liberal immigrants may experience social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, and lack of access to social services and community resources. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
5. Lack of political representation: Non-upper-class, non-liberal immigrants may feel marginalized and disconnected from the political process, leading to a lack of representation and voice in policy-making decisions that affect their lives.
6. Financial challenges: Non-upper-class, non-liberal immigrants may face financial challenges due to limited access to financial resources and services, such as credit and bank accounts. This can make it difficult for them to cover basic living expenses and save for the future.
7. Limited access to legal aid: Non-upper-class, non-liberal immigrants may have limited access to legal aid and representation, which can make it more difficult for them to navigate the complex immigration system and achieve a positive outcome.
8. Increased vulnerability to exploitation: Non-upper-class, non-liberal immigrants may be more vulnerable to exploitation by employers,
