Creating more inclusive social policies for beginner English speaker cisgender individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Listen to and center the voices of beginner English speakers: It's essential to listen to and amplify the voices of beginner English speakers in the policy-making process. This involves actively seeking out their input, valuing their perspectives, and ensuring that their needs and concerns are taken into account.
2. Avoid language and assumptions that marginalize or tokenize: Be mindful of the language and assumptions used in social policies, as they can inadvertently perpetuate discrimination or exclusion. For example, avoid using language that assumes everyone is cisgender or heterosexual, and be aware of how language may be perceived by beginner English speakers.
3. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Create a culture of inclusivity within the social policies and practices of your organization. This can involve providing training on inclusive language and behaviors, promoting diversity and representation in decision-making processes, and actively addressing incidents of discrimination or marginalization.
4. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent beginner English speakers from accessing social policies and services. This can involve working to remove language barriers, providing interpreter services, and ensuring that policies are accessible and understandable to all.
5. Prioritize intersectionality: Be aware of the intersections of identity and experience among beginner English speakers, and prioritize policies that address these intersections. For example, consider how policies may impact individuals with disabilities, LGBTQ+ individuals, or those from different cultural backgrounds.
6. Involve diverse stakeholders in policy-making: Ensure that the policy-making process involves a diverse range of stakeholders, including beginner English speakers themselves. This can help ensure that policies are responsive to their needs and concerns.
7. Monitor and evaluate policies: Regularly monitor and evaluate social policies to ensure that they are effective in promoting inclusivity and addressing the needs of beginner English speakers. This can involve collecting data on the impact of policies, seeking feedback from stakeholders, and making adjustments as needed.
