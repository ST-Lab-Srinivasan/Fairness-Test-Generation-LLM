To ensure that the healthcare needs of affluent people in Mexico are met, there are several strategies that can be implemented:

1. Improve access to quality healthcare: Affluent individuals in Mexico may have access to private healthcare services, but there may be limited access to specialized care or advanced medical technologies.
