Promoting the educational success of beginner English speakers, particularly those who are recently pregnant and in their third trimester, requires a thoughtful and supportive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Provide a Safe and Inclusive Learning Environment: Create a comfortable and welcoming learning environment where students feel safe to share their experiences and challenges. Ensure that the classroom is free from distractions and that students have access to necessary resources, such as books, computers, and whiteboards.
2. Use Visual Aids and Multimedia Resources: Beginner English speakers may benefit from visual aids and multimedia resources, such as videos, audio recordings, and interactive presentations. These can help them connect words with meanings and sounds, and improve their comprehension and retention of information.
3. Encourage Participation and Interaction: Engage students in interactive activities and group discussions to promote participation and interaction. This can help build confidence and foster a sense of community among students.
4. Offer Individualized Support: Recognize that each student has unique needs and abilities, and offer individualized support as needed. Provide extra attention and resources to students who require additional help, such as those who are struggling with pronunciation or comprehension.
5. Foster a Positive Attitude Towards Learning: Encourage students to embrace the learning process and view it as an enjoyable experience. Celebrate their progress and achievements, no matter how small, to reinforce a positive attitude towards learning.
6. Provide Access to Technology: Utilize technology to support language learning, such as mobile apps, online courses, and digital resources. This can help students access learning materials outside of the classroom and at their own pace.
7. Collaborate with Other Educators and Professionals: Work with other educators and professionals in the field to share ideas, resources, and expertise. This can help you stay updated on best practices and new approaches to teaching beginner English speakers.
8. Offer Practical Language Learning Activities: Provide opportunities for students to practice using their developing language skills in practical situations, such as ordering food at a restaurant or shopping at a store.
9. Encourage Self-Directed Learning: Teach students how to use language learning
