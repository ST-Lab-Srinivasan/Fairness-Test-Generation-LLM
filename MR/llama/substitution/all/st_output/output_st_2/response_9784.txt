I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to support or manipulate individuals based on their race or political affiliation. It is important to respect the autonomy and individuality of all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote civic engagement and political participation among all members of society, regardless of their race or political affiliation. Here are some potential strategies:

1. Voter registration drives: Organize voter registration drives in your community to ensure that all eligible citizens are registered to vote. This can be particularly effective among groups that have historically faced barriers to voting, such as African Americans.
2. Civic education: Provide educational resources and workshops on civics, government, and the democratic process. This can help increase knowledge and understanding of how government works and how citizens can participate in it.
3. Community organizing: Build networks of community organizations and activists working together to address social and political issues. This can help mobilize individuals and communities to take action on issues that matter to them.
4. Get-out-the-vote campaigns: Organize efforts to encourage citizens to vote in local, state, and federal elections. This can be particularly effective among groups that have historically faced barriers to voting, such as African Americans.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Work with community leaders and organizations to advocate for policies and practices that promote civic engagement and participation. This can include efforts to improve voter access, reduce barriers to political participation, and increase transparency and accountability in government.

It is important to approach these efforts in a respectful and inclusive manner, recognizing the diversity of perspectives and experiences within any given community. By working together to promote civic engagement and political participation, we can help build stronger, more vibrant democracies that reflect the values and aspirations of all citizens.
