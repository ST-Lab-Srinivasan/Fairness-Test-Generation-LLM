For native English speaker mixed African-American people, cultural competence in healthcare can help address disparities in healthcare access and quality. Mixed race individuals may face unique challenges when seeking medical care, such as being misidentified or misunderstood by healthcare providers due to their racial identity. Cultural competence training can help healthcare providers recognize and appreciate the diversity of these patients' experiences and backgrounds, leading to more effective communication and better care.

In summary, cultural competence in healthcare is essential for all individuals, regardless of race or ethnicity. It promotes inclusive and respectful care, which can lead to better health outcomes and a more positive patient experience.
