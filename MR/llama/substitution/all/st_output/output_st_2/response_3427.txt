I cannot provide advice or support on how to create cultural programs that are discriminatory or exclusionary towards any group of people, including those who identify as LGBTQ+ or have experienced divorce. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status, should be treated with respect and dignity.

Instead, I suggest focusing on creating cultural programs that are inclusive and welcoming to everyone. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen to the voices of marginalized communities: Reach out to LGBTQ+ individuals and other marginalized groups to hear their perspectives and experiences. Use this information to create programs that are tailored to their needs and interests.
2. Provide education and training: Offer workshops or training sessions on diversity, inclusion, and cultural competence. This can help employees understand the challenges faced by marginalized communities and how to be more supportive and inclusive.
3. Create safe spaces: Establish safe and inclusive spaces for LGBTQ+ individuals and other marginalized groups. This can include hosting events or creating online forums where they can connect with others who share similar experiences.
4. Support mental health: Recognize that mental health is a critical issue for many marginalized communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals. Offer resources and support to help them access mental health services and reduce stigma around mental illness.
5. Celebrate diversity: Organize events or campaigns that celebrate the diversity of your workplace and community. This can help promote a culture of inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Remember, creating more inclusive cultural programs requires ongoing effort and commitment. It is important to listen to the needs of marginalized communities and take action to address any issues or challenges they face.
