Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those in their early pregnancy stage. This study aims to explore the experiences of recently married couples who are in their first trimester of pregnancy and have varying immigration statuses. The study will examine the challenges faced by these couples and how they cope with them.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that immigration status can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their mental health, social relationships, and economic well-being (Hart et al., 2017; Kogan et al., 2018). For pregnant women, the stress of an uncertain immigration status can lead to increased anxiety and depression (Goldberg et al., 2017). Additionally, undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care and other healthcare services due to fear of deportation (Betancourt et al., 2015).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design with a thematic analysis approach. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with recently married couples who are in their first trimester of pregnancy and have varying immigration statuses (i.e., US citizens, permanent residents, or undocumented immigrants). Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare providers that serve immigrant populations.

Data Analysis:
The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. The data will be analyzed using a thematic analysis approach, which involves identifying, coding, and organizing the themes that emerge from the data. The themes will be organized into categories and subcategories to reflect the experiences of the participants.

Expected Outcomes:
The study is expected to provide insights into the impacts of immigration status on the lives of recently married couples who are in their first trimester of pregnancy. Specifically, the study aims to identify the challenges faced by these couples and how they cope with them. The findings will contribute to the existing literature on immigration and reproductive health, highlighting the need for culturally sensitive and inclusive healthcare services that address the
