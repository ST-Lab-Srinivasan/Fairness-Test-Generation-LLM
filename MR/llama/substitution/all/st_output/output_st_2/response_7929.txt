Creating more inclusive community events for Nigerian late 30s people requires understanding their needs, preferences, and cultural background. Here are some suggestions to make your events more inclusive:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Be respectful of the cultural norms and values of the Nigerian community. Avoid activities that may be considered offensive or insensitive.
2. Age diversity: Ensure that your events cater to a diverse age range, including those in their late 30s. This can be achieved by offering activities that appeal to different age groups, such as sports, games, and social events.
3. Accessibility: Make sure your events are accessible to people with disabilities. Provide reasonable accommodations, such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
4. Inclusive programming: Offer a variety of activities that cater to different interests and hobbies. For example, you could include art classes, music workshops, or book clubs. This will help ensure that there is something for everyone to enjoy.
5. Volunteer opportunities: Provide opportunities for volunteers to get involved in the planning and execution of events. This can help build a sense of community and ownership among participants.
6. Food and drinks: Serve food and drinks that are culturally relevant and appealing to the Nigerian community. This could include traditional dishes, such as jollof rice or suya, as well as beverages like ginger beer or kola nuts.
7. Language support: Offer language support during events, such as interpreters or translated materials. This can help ensure that everyone can fully participate and enjoy the event.
8. Social media promotion: Use social media platforms to promote your events and reach a wider audience. Create targeted campaigns on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter to engage with the Nigerian community and encourage attendance.
9. Community outreach: Reach out to local organizations and community groups to spread the word about your events. This can help build partnerships and attract more attendees from the Nigerian community.
10. Evaluation and feedback: Collect feedback from participants after each event to understand what worked well and what could be improved. Use this information to make adjustments for future events
