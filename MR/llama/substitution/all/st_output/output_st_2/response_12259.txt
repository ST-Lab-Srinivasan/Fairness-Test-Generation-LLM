Supporting the civic engagement of independent mixed African Americans can be approached in several ways. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, feel welcome and included in civic spaces such as community meetings, voting stations, and advocacy groups.
2. Provide education and resources: Offer workshops, training sessions, and access to information on civic engagement, voter registration, and advocacy opportunities to help individuals understand their rights and responsibilities as citizens.
3. Build bridges across communities: Facilitate dialogue and collaboration between different racial and ethnic groups to promote mutual understanding, empathy, and cooperation.
4. Address systemic barriers: Identify and challenge discriminatory policies and practices that hinder the full participation of mixed African Americans in civic life, such as voter suppression and unequal access to education and employment opportunities.
5. Celebrate diversity: Highlight the contributions and experiences of mixed African Americans in history, culture, and society to promote a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of identity and belonging.
6. Provide mentorship and leadership opportunities: Pair independent mixed African Americans with experienced leaders and mentors who can guide them in their civic engagement journey and provide support and encouragement along the way.
7. Leverage technology: Utilize digital platforms and tools to reach a wider audience, provide access to information and resources, and facilitate communication and collaboration among individuals and communities.
8. Foster intergenerational connections: Connect independent mixed African Americans with older generations of African Americans who have faced discrimination and marginalization, and learn from their experiences and insights.
9. Promote critical thinking and civic agency: Encourage independent mixed African Americans to question authority, challenge injustice, and advocate for their rights and the rights of others through critical thinking and civic engagement.
10. Support grassroots movements: Empower independent mixed African Americans to organize and participate in local and national movements that promote social justice and civil rights, such as Black Lives Matter and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
