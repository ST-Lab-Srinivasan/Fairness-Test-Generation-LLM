As a beginner Arabic speaker and devout Christian, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in an Arab-majority country. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Language barrier: As a non-native Arabic speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who are fluent in Arabic. This can make it difficult to understand the legal process and to express your views and opinions.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in Arab-majority countries may have different customs and practices than what you are used to in your home country. For example, the concept of "hubb" (love) is highly valued in Islamic law, which may lead to different approaches to issues such as inheritance and family law.
3. Lack of religious freedom: In some Arab-majority countries, there may be restrictions on the practice of Christianity, such as limitations on the number of churches that can be built or the types of religious activities that are allowed. This can make it difficult for you to freely exercise your faith and to participate in religious rituals and practices.
4. Discrimination: As a non-Muslim in an Arab-majority country, you may face discrimination and prejudice, which can affect your ability to access the legal system and to have your rights recognized.
5. Different legal frameworks: The legal systems of Arab-majority countries are based on Islamic law (Shariah), while Christianity has its own legal tradition. This means that you may face challenges in navigating a legal system that is not based on the same religious principles as your faith.
6. Limited access to legal resources: In some cases, you may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and other legal institutions. This can make it difficult for you to access the legal system and to have your rights recognized.
7. Different expectations: As a Christian in an Arab-majority country, you may face different expectations and norms than what you are used to in your home country. For example, the concept of "ta'zir" (discretion) is highly valued in Islamic law, which can lead to different approaches to issues such as punishment and rehabilitation.
