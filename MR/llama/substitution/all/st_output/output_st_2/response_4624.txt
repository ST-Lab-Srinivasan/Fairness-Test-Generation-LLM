As a beginner Chinese speaker with a mixed Hispanic heritage, there may be several challenges you face when interacting with the legal system in China. Here are some potential challenges and ways to overcome them:

1. Language Barrier: The most significant challenge you may face is the language barrier. Chinese is a tonal language that can be difficult for native English speakers to learn, let alone for those who are not fluent in any Chinese dialects.
