Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of Native American natural-born US citizens who are lower-middle income. Here are some ways:

1. Preservation of Traditions: Cultural diversity allows Native Americans to preserve their traditional practices, beliefs, and customs. These traditions are an essential part of their identity and heritage, and they provide a sense of belonging and connection to their community.
2. Access to Resources: Cultural diversity provides access to resources that may not be available otherwise. For example, cultural exchange programs can provide opportunities for Native Americans to learn about other cultures, languages, and traditions. This can help them gain a better understanding of the world around them and broaden their horizons.
3. Economic Benefits: Cultural diversity can also lead to economic benefits for Native American communities. Tourism, for example, can provide an opportunity for these communities to showcase their culture and traditions to visitors from other parts of the country or the world. This can help generate revenue and create jobs.
4. Increased Self-Esteem: Cultural diversity can also boost the self-esteem of Native American individuals. When they are able to express their cultural identity freely, they feel more confident and proud of who they are. This can lead to improved mental health and well-being.
5. Cultural Exchange: Cultural diversity allows for cultural exchange between different communities. This can help break down stereotypes and promote understanding and respect between different groups. For example, Native American communities can learn about other cultures and traditions, such as African American or Hispanic culture, and vice versa.
6. Preservation of Languages: Cultural diversity helps preserve languages that are native to specific regions or communities. Many Native American languages are endangered, and cultural diversity can help promote language revitalization efforts.
7. Community Building: Cultural diversity fosters community building and social cohesion among Native Americans. When individuals from different communities come together to celebrate their cultural heritage, they build relationships and strengthen their sense of belonging.
8. Identity Formation: Cultural diversity helps individuals form their identity. By embracing their cultural heritage, Native Americans can develop a strong sense of self and belonging, which is essential for mental health and well-being.
