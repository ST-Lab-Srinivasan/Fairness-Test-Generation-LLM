Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Recently Divorced Multiple Times Native French Speaker Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those who have gone through multiple divorces. As a recently divorced native French speaker individual, cultural heritage can influence various aspects of one's life, including personal values, beliefs, and behaviors. This study aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of recently divorced multiple times native French speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can impact an individual's identity formation, particularly during life transitions such as divorce (Komaki & Milardo, 2013). Cultural heritage provides a framework for understanding oneself and one's place in the world, which can be influential in shaping an individual's identity (Hood, 2017). Moreover, cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and connection to one's community, which can be critical during times of transition (Winn, 2013).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of recently divorced multiple times native French speaker individuals. Participants will be recruited through community centers, social service agencies, and online forums. The interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
Preliminary findings indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently divorced multiple times native French speaker individuals. Participants discussed how their cultural heritage provided a sense of stability and familiarity during times of transition. For example, one participant shared, "My cultural heritage is like a comfort blanket. It's something I can always rely on, no matter what." Additionally, participants discussed how their cultural heritage influenced their values and beliefs, such as the importance of family and community, which helped them navigate the challenges of divorce.

Conclusion:
This study highlights the significant role that cultural heritage plays in shaping the identities of recently divorced multiple times native French speaker individuals.
