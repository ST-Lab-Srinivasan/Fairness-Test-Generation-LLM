Creating more inclusive cultural events for temporary visa holders, particularly those who identify as leftists or have leftist political views, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and experiences of temporary visa holders: Conduct research and engage with temporary visa holders to understand their experiences and needs. This can help you design events that are tailored to their interests and comfort levels.
2. Involve temporary visa holders in event planning: Incorporate temporary visa holders into the planning process for cultural events. This can help ensure that their voices are heard and that the events are more likely to be inclusive and welcoming.
3. Provide language support: Offer translation services or interpretive assistance at events to help temporary visa holders who may not speak the dominant language of the host country.
4. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for temporary visa holders to connect with one another and build relationships. This can help them feel less isolated and more connected to their local communities.
5. Address power imbalances: Be aware of power dynamics and privilege structures that may exist within the event planning process or at the events themselves. Take steps to address these imbalances and create a more equitable and inclusive environment for all participants.
6. Offer childcare and other support services: Temporary visa holders may have additional responsibilities, such as caring for children or elderly relatives. Providing childcare or other support services can help make it easier for them to participate in cultural events.
7. Be mindful of cultural sensitivities: Be respectful of the cultural practices and beliefs of temporary visa holders. Avoid assumptions or stereotypes based on their country of origin or immigration status.
8. Create a safe space: Ensure that cultural events are free from discrimination, harassment, and other forms of harm. Provide clear policies and procedures for reporting incidents and addressing concerns.
9. Foster intercultural dialogue: Encourage temporary visa holders to share their perspectives and experiences with the host community. This can help build bridges between different cultural groups and foster greater understanding and respect.
10. Celebrate diversity: Embrace
