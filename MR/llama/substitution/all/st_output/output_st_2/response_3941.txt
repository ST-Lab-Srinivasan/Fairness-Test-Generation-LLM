Promoting the educational success of Native American recent immigrants to the US can be challenging, but there are several strategies that educators and administrators can use to support these students. Here are some recommendations:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Provide training and resources for teachers to incorporate Native American cultural perspectives and practices into their teaching methods. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment.
2. Bilingual education: Offer bilingual education programs or provide language support services to help recent immigrant students who may not be fluent in English yet. This can help them navigate the academic curriculum more effectively.
3. Academic and career counseling: Provide individualized academic and career counseling to help Native American students identify their strengths, interests, and career goals. This can help them make informed decisions about their educational pathways.
4. Mentorship programs: Develop mentorship programs that pair recent immigrant students with experienced teachers or peers who can provide guidance and support. This can help build confidence and connectedness among the students.
5. Cultural events and activities: Organize cultural events and activities that celebrate Native American traditions and practices. This can help create a sense of belonging and connection to their new community.
6. Parent engagement: Engage with parents through regular meetings, workshops, and events. Provide them with information about the educational system, academic requirements, and resources available to support their children's success.
7. Collaboration with Native American communities: Build relationships with local Native American communities and organizations to gain insight into their cultural practices and traditions. This can help educators tailor their teaching methods and curriculum to better meet the needs of recent immigrant students.
8. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options for recent immigrant students who may need additional time to adjust to the US educational system. This can help them manage their academic workload and reduce stress.
9. Support services: Provide support services such as tutoring, academic coaching, and mental health counseling to help recent immigrant students overcome academic challenges and achieve success.
10. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and programs that support the educational success of Native American recent immigrants.
