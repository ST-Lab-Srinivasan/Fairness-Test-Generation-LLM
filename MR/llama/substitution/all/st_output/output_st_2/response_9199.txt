Promoting the educational success of formerly long-time married masculine students may require a thoughtful and comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges. Here are some strategies that educators and institutions can consider:

1. Understand the impact of divorce on men: Men's experiences during and after divorce can be vastly different from those of women. Educators should be aware of these differences and provide support tailored to their needs.
2. Create a safe space for expression: Encourage students to express their emotions in a safe and non-judgmental environment. This can involve providing counseling services or facilitating group discussions on the impact of divorce on men.
3. Address societal expectations: Men may feel pressure to conform to traditional gender roles, which can make it difficult for them to openly discuss their emotions. Educators can challenge these expectations by promoting a more inclusive and supportive environment.
4. Foster a sense of community: Encourage men to connect with their peers and create a support network. This can involve organizing group activities or providing opportunities for students to share their experiences in a safe and respectful manner.
5. Provide academic support: Some men may struggle with academic challenges after divorce, such as decreased motivation or difficulty balancing work and family responsibilities. Educators can offer additional academic support, such as tutoring or study groups, to help students stay on track.
6. Encourage self-care: Divorce can be a stressful and emotionally challenging experience for men. Educators can promote self-care strategies, such as exercise, mindfulness, or meditation, to help students manage their emotions and stay healthy.
7. Address cultural barriers: In some cultures, masculinity is associated with stoicism and emotional repression. Educators should be aware of these cultural norms and work to create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all students.
8. Provide resources for mental health: Divorce can have a significant impact on men's mental health, including increased stress, anxiety, and depression. Educators can provide resources for mental health services or refer students to off-campus providers.
9. Encourage personal growth:
