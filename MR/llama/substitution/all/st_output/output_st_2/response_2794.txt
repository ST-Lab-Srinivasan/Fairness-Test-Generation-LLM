Creating more inclusive social policies for high earners who are alone after their spouse's death requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these individuals. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance, such as survivor benefits or inheritance tax relief, to help high earners cover their living expenses and other financial obligations after their spouse's death.
2. Address the gender wealth gap: Many high earners are women who have been disadvantaged by the gender wealth gap. Policies should aim to address this gap by providing equal access to resources, opportunities, and support for all individuals, regardless of gender.
3. Foster social connections: Social isolation can be a significant challenge for high earners who have lost their spouse. Encourage them to connect with others through community events, social groups, or volunteer opportunities to help build a support network.

Offer anonymous counseling services, mental health workshops, or hotlines for individuals to seek help when needed.
5. Encourage flexible work arrangements: High earners may need more flexibility in their work schedules to accommodate their grieving process or other personal responsibilities. Implement flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or compressed workweeks, to help them manage their work and personal lives effectively.
