Supporting the social inclusion of Nigerian not lifelong single people can be done through various means. Here are some ways to promote social inclusion:

1. Encourage intergenerational interactions: Organize events or activities that bring together people of different ages, such as elderly citizens and young people, to foster mutual understanding and respect.
2. Promote cultural exchange programs: Organize cultural exchange programs between Nigerian single people and other communities to help break down stereotypes and promote cross-cultural understanding.
3. Create inclusive spaces: Develop public spaces that are accessible and welcoming to all, regardless of their marital status. This can include parks, community centers, or other public facilities.
4. Support education and job training programs: Provide access to education and job training programs for Nigerian single people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to help them acquire new skills and improve their socio-economic status.
5. Encourage community service: Organize community service projects that bring together Nigerian single people and other members of society to work towards a common goal, promoting social cohesion and volunteerism.
6. Address stigmatization and discrimination: Challenge harmful cultural attitudes and practices that perpetuate stigmatization and discrimination against Nigerian single people. Encourage media representation that challenges these stereotypes and promotes positive representations of singleness.
7. Foster family support: Provide support to families, particularly those with single parents or caregivers, to help them navigate the challenges of raising children alone.
8. Promote social entrepreneurship: Encourage Nigerian single people to start their own businesses or social enterprises, providing them with training and resources to help them succeed.
9. Develop mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair Nigerian single people with experienced professionals or peers, providing guidance and support in areas such as career development, personal growth, and social integration.
10. Advocate for policy change: Work with government officials and advocacy groups to push for policies that promote the social inclusion of Nigerian single people, such as affordable housing, access to healthcare, and equal inheritance rights.
