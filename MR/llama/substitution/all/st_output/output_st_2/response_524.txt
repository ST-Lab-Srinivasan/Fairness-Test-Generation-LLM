Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for partially identifying as non-binary and partly asexual individuals requires understanding, respect, and intentional planning. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" and "women") and instead use terms like "people," "individuals," or "community."
2. Gender-Neutral Terminology: Use gender-neutral terminology when referring to people, roles, or responsibilities. For example, instead of saying "king" or "queen," use terms like "leader" or "chief."
3. Inclusive Costumes: Encourage participants to dress in costumes that are inclusive of all gender identities. Provide guidance on how to create costumes that are respectful and comfortable for everyone.
4. Asexual Representation: Make sure there is representation for asexual individuals in your cultural celebrations. This can be as simple as having an asexual flag or symbol present at the event, or incorporating acespecific elements into the celebration itself.
5. Consent-Based Interactions: Ensure that all interactions during the cultural celebration are consensual and respectful. Provide clear guidelines on how to ask for consent and how to respect someone's boundaries.
6. Accessibility: Make sure the cultural celebration is accessible to people of all abilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or audio descriptions for those who are visually impaired.
7. Inclusive Food and Drink: Offer a variety of food and drink options that are inclusive of all dietary needs and preferences. This can include vegan, gluten-free, and allergy-friendly options.
8. Performance and Entertainment: Ensure that the performance and entertainment aspects of the cultural celebration are inclusive of all gender identities and sexual orientations. Use diverse representation in your performances, and make sure there is a range of voices and perspectives represented.
9. Safe Space: Create a safe space for individuals to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. Make sure
