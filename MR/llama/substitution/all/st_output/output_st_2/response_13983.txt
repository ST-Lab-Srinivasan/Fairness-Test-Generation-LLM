The impact of immigration status on the lives of lower-class moderate liberals can be complex and multifaceted. Here are some potential effects:

1. Fear of deportation: Lower-class moderate liberals may worry about their undocumented family members or friends being deported, which can lead to stress, anxiety, and emotional distress.
2. Limited access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers when trying to access medical care, including lack of insurance coverage, language barriers, and fear of discrimination. This can result in delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate health problems.
3. Economic insecurity: Lower-class moderate liberals may struggle to make ends meet, regardless of their immigration status. They may face challenges finding stable, well-paying jobs due to discrimination, lack of education or job skills, and limited access to resources and opportunities.
4. Social isolation: Undocumented immigrants may feel socially isolated, as they may be reluctant to form close relationships with people who could potentially report them to authorities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Lower-class moderate liberals may face discrimination and stigma due to their immigration status, which can lead to lowered self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. They may also experience microaggressions and biases in their daily lives.
6. Limited access to education: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when trying to access education, including lack of documentation, language barriers, and fear of discrimination. This can limit their opportunities for personal and professional growth.
7. Fear of family separation: Lower-class moderate liberals may worry about being separated from their families due to deportation or other immigration-related issues. This can lead to emotional distress and feelings of powerlessness.
8. Limited access to legal resources: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when trying to access legal resources, including lack of representation, language barriers, and fear of discrimination. This can limit their ability to navigate the complex U.S. immigration system.
9. Internalized oppression
