Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrant natural-born US citizens who are not libertarians. As individuals, they bring with them their own unique cultural backgrounds and values, which can influence their perspectives on various issues, including politics, social norms, and personal beliefs. In this essay, we will explore the role that cultural heritage plays in shaping the identities of these individuals and how it impacts their political views.

Cultural heritage and identity:
Cultural heritage refers to the shared knowledge, traditions, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or society. It encompasses a wide range of elements, including language, religion, customs, and historical events. For immigrant natural-born US citizens who are not libertarians, their cultural heritage plays a crucial role in shaping their identities. It influences how they view themselves and their place within society, as well as their attitudes towards politics and governance.

For example, individuals from collectivist cultures, where the group is valued over the individual, may be more likely to support policies that prioritize community welfare and social cohesion. On the other hand, those from individualistic cultures, where personal freedom and autonomy are prized, may be more inclined towards libertarian views.

Cultural heritage can also shape an individual's political beliefs by influencing their values and worldview. For instance, someone who grew up in a culture that emphasizes the importance of family and community may be more likely to support policies that promote social welfare and protection of vulnerable groups. In contrast, someone from a culture that places a high value on personal responsibility and self-reliance may be more inclined towards individualistic political views.
