Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for those who have experienced multiple divorces. In France, where the study is taking place, cultural heritage is deeply ingrained in the society and has a profound impact on individual identities. This study aims to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of divorced native French speakers who have gone through multiple divorces.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that cultural heritage can have both positive and negative effects on identity formation (Hall, 1980; Giddens, 1991).

On the other hand, it can also create a sense of obligation to preserve cultural traditions and values, which may conflict with individual desires and goals (Baumeister & Leary, 1995).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, focusing on in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of 20 divorced native French speakers who have gone through multiple divorces.

The interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis.

3. Conflict between cultural heritage and identity: Participants may experience conflict between their cultural heritage and their individual identities, leading to feelings of confusion and disorientation.
4. Negotiation and redefinition of cultural heritage: Participants may negotiate and redefine their cultural heritage in response to changing
