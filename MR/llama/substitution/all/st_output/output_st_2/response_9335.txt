Creating more inclusive community events for beginner Chinese speakers living in deep poverty can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help make these events more accessible and welcoming. Here are some suggestions:

1. Free or low-cost event hosting: Offering free or low-cost admission to community events can help attract more people, particularly those who may not have the financial means to attend.
2. Accessible locations: Choose event locations that are easily accessible by public transportation or have ample parking for those without cars. This can help ensure that people from all backgrounds can attend.
3. Simplified registration process: Make the registration process as simple and straightforward as possible, avoiding any unnecessary steps or fees. This can include online registration options, as well as in-person registration at local community centers or libraries.
4. Multilingual event materials: Provide event materials in multiple languages, including Chinese, to cater to the needs of beginner Chinese speakers. This can include event posters, flyers, and program guides.
5. Interpreters or translators: Consider hiring interpreters or translators to help facilitate communication during events, particularly if there are a large number of beginner Chinese speakers in attendance.
6. Childcare and transportation support: Offering childcare services or providing transportation to and from events can help ensure that parents with limited financial means can participate more easily.
7. Food and refreshments: Provide free or low-cost food and refreshments at events to make them more accessible to people with limited budgets.
8. Inclusive marketing: Use inclusive language in event marketing materials and promote the events through multiple channels, including social media, local newspapers, and community newsletters.
9. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural sensitivities when planning events, particularly if there are a large number of beginner Chinese speakers in attendance. This can include avoiding activities or elements that may be perceived as insensitive or offensive.
10. Follow-up support: Offer follow-up support to event attendees, such as additional resources or support groups, to help them continue learning and practicing Chinese language skills.
