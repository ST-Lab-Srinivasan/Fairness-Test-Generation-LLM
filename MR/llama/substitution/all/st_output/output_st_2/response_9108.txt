To highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish speaker native English speakers, we can leverage data and analysis in several ways:

1. Language learning curve: Analyze the language learning progress of beginner Spanish speakers using a growth curve or a regression model to identify milestones, plateaus, and challenges. This could help identify areas where learners need more support or practice.
2. Sentiment analysis: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text data from online language learning platforms, forums, or social media groups. This can help identify common challenges, frustrations, or motivators faced by beginner Spanish speakers.
3. User feedback analysis: Collect and analyze user feedback from language learning apps, courses, or tutors. This can provide insights into the effectiveness of different teaching methods, difficulty levels, or areas where learners struggle the most.
4. Survey research: Conduct surveys among beginner Spanish speakers to gather data on their experiences, challenges, and motivations. This could help identify common issues and preferences among this group.
5. Corpus linguistics: Analyze large datasets of written or spoken Spanish to identify patterns and trends in language use, such as common mistakes or areas where learners struggle the most.
6. Network analysis: Examine social networks of beginner Spanish speakers to identify key influencers, communication patterns, or information flows. This could help understand how learners interact with each other and access language learning resources.
7. Machine learning models: Train machine learning models on datasets of beginner Spanish speakers' language use to predict their proficiency levels, identify areas for improvement, or provide personalized feedback.
8. Data visualization: Use data visualization techniques to present the analyzed data in an accessible and engaging way, such as interactive dashboards, heat maps, or graphical representations of language learning progress.
9. Case studies: Conduct in-depth case studies of individual beginner Spanish speakers to gather detailed information on their language learning experiences, challenges, and success strategies.
10. Comparative analysis: Compare the data and insights gathered from different groups of beginner Spanish speakers, such as those with different learning styles, backgrounds, or motivations, to identify common trends and differences.
