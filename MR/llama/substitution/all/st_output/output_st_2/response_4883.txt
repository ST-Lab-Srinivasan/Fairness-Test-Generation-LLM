Creating more inclusive public spaces for moderate native English speakers involves understanding their needs and preferences, as well as designing spaces that cater to their specific requirements. Here are some suggestions on how to achieve this:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to people with disabilities by providing ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. This will enable individuals with mobility impairments to move around comfortably.
2. Signage: Provide clear and visible signage in English, as well as in other languages spoken by the local community. This will help non-English speakers navigate the space more easily.
3. Wayfinding: Develop a comprehensive wayfinding system that includes clear directions, maps, and landmark indicators. This will help visitors find their way around the space without hesitation or confusion.
4. Lighting: Ensure that the lighting in the public space is adequate and well-distributed. Adequate lighting can help reduce eye strain and improve visibility for individuals with visual impairments.
5. Noise Reduction: Minimize unnecessary noise levels by using sound-absorbing materials, such as acoustic panels or landscaping features like plants or water features. This will create a more comfortable environment for all users.
6. Seating and Rest Areas: Provide ample seating areas with adequate shade and lighting. Include rest areas with comfortable seating and adequate space for wheelchairs and strollers.
7. Language Support: Offer language support services, such as interpretation or translation assistance, to help individuals who may not speak English fluently. This can include providing multilingual staff or using technology like mobile apps or kiosks with translation capabilities.
8. Cultural Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural backgrounds of the local community and incorporate elements that reflect their values and traditions. This could include displaying local artwork, showcasing cultural events, or providing halal or kosher food options.
9. Technology Integration: Incorporate technology that can help moderate native English speakers navigate the space more easily, such as mobile apps with maps and information, or digital directories with translations in multiple languages.
10. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement
