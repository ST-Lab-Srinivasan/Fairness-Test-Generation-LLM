Creating more inclusive social policies for blue-collar ex-spouse individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges they face. Here are some recommendations to create a more supportive and equitable society:

1. Acknowledge the importance of blue-collar work: Blue-collar jobs are often undervalued and overlooked, yet they provide essential services and contribute significantly to the economy. Recognize the value of these jobs and the people who perform them.
2. Address gender roles and stereotypes: Traditional gender roles can limit the opportunities and support available to blue-collar ex-spouses. Challenge these stereotypes by promoting gender equality and providing equal access to education, training, and career advancement opportunities.
3. Provide financial assistance: Many blue-collar ex-spouses face significant financial challenges, including limited access to wealth and resources. Offer financial aid, such as alimony or spousal support, to help them rebuild their lives.
