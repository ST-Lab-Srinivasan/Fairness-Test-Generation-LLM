In terms of ensuring that the housing needs of mentally able-bodied secular Jewish individuals are met, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Inclusive Housing Policies: Implement inclusive housing policies that promote accessibility and diversity in all forms of housing, including apartments, condos, and single-family homes. This can include features such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible bathroom and kitchen facilities.
2. Affordable Housing: Ensure that affordable housing options are available to individuals with a range of abilities and income levels. This can involve partnering with non-profit organizations and government agencies to provide subsidized housing options.
3. Education and Awareness: Educate the broader community about the needs and experiences of individuals with disabilities, including mental health conditions. This can help to promote greater understanding, empathy, and inclusivity.
4. Accessible Design: Ensure that all new construction and renovations are designed and built with accessibility in mind, including features such as wider doorways, level entry showers, and accessible kitchen and bathroom fixtures.

In summary, ensuring that the housing needs of mentally able-bodied secular Jewish individuals are met requires a multi-faceted approach that includes inclusive policies, affordable housing options, education and awareness, accessible design, support services, and advocacy. By working together to address these issues,
