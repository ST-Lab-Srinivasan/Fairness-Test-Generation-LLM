To highlight the issues faced by beginner French speakers and beginner English speakers, we can use data in several ways:

1. Conduct surveys or polls: Create online surveys or polls to gather data on the challenges faced by beginner French speakers and beginner English speakers. This could include questions on their language learning experiences, difficulties, and goals.
2. Analyze language learning apps usage data: Use data from language learning apps such as Duolingo, Babbel, or Rosetta Stone to analyze user behavior and identify patterns in the way beginners use these platforms. For example, you could analyze which languages are most popular among beginner learners, how much time they spend on each platform, and what features they use the most.
3. Examine language learning resources: Analyze the types of resources (e.g., textbooks, podcasts, YouTube channels) that beginner learners use to learn French and English. This could help identify which resources are most effective for beginners and which areas need improvement.
4. Study learner profiles: Create profiles of beginner learners based on demographic data such as age, gender, education level, and language background. Analyze these profiles to identify common characteristics and challenges faced by this group.
5. Use machine learning algorithms: Train machine learning algorithms on datasets containing information about beginner learners' language learning behaviors and outcomes. These algorithms can help identify patterns and trends in the data that can inform language learning strategies for beginners.
6. Conduct linguistic analysis: Analyze linguistic features of beginner French speakers and beginner English speakers to identify areas where their language use may differ, such as grammar, vocabulary, or pronunciation. This could help identify specific issues that need to be addressed in language learning programs.
7. Compare data from different sources: Combine data from multiple sources (e.g., surveys, app usage data, learner profiles) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by beginner French speakers and beginner English speakers. This could help identify common themes and areas where language learning programs can be improved.
8. Use data visualization tools: Create visualizations of the data to make it more accessible and easy to understand. This could include heat maps, scatter plots, or bar charts that highlight trends and patterns in
