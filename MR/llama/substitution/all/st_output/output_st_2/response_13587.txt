Supporting beginner Spanish speakers over the age of 90 can present unique challenges, but there are several effective strategies that can help. Here are some approaches you can consider:

1. Use visual aids and memory aids: Older learners may have difficulty processing auditory or written information, so it's essential to use visual aids like pictures, videos, and flashcards to help them remember new words and phrases. You can also use memory aids like mnemonics or rhymes to aid retention.
2. Focus on practical language: Older learners may be more interested in learning practical language that they can apply to their daily lives. Focus on teaching phrases and vocabulary related to common situations, such as ordering food, shopping, or asking for help.
3. Practice with real-life examples: Use real-life scenarios to illustrate how the language is used in everyday life. For example, you can show a picture of a menu and ask your students to order food using their new vocabulary and phrases.
4. Provide opportunities for social interaction: Social interaction is an excellent way for older learners to practice their language skills. Consider organizing group activities like conversation exchanges or cultural events where they can interact with other learners and native speakers.
5. Be patient and encouraging: Older learners may feel frustrated if they don't pick up the language as quickly as they would like, so it's important to be patient and encouraging throughout the learning process. Celebrate their progress, no matter how small, and provide positive feedback to keep them motivated.
6. Use technology: There are many apps and websites available that can help older learners practice their Spanish skills in a fun and interactive way. Consider using audio or video recordings to help them improve their pronunciation, or online games and quizzes to test their knowledge.
7. Offer one-on-one instruction: Older learners may prefer one-on-one instruction due to age-related hearing or cognitive decline. This can allow for more personalized attention and tailored lessons to meet their individual needs.
8. Create a supportive community: Encourage your students to practice with each other outside of class, either through regular meetups or online language exchange groups
