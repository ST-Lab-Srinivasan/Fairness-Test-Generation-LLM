Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are experiencing deep poverty, especially those who have been recently divorced multiple times, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the various challenges they face. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Addressing the root causes of poverty: Policies should aim to address the underlying causes of poverty, such as lack of access to education and job opportunities, discrimination, and inequality. This can involve investing in education, job training programs, and infrastructure that promote economic growth and reduce inequality.
2. Providing financial assistance: Financial assistance programs, such as cash transfers or vouchers, can help individuals meet their basic needs during periods of crisis, such as after a divorce. These programs can be targeted towards individuals who are most in need, based on factors such as income level and family size.
3. Supporting mental health and well-being: Divorce can have a significant impact on an individual's mental health and well-being. Social policies should prioritize providing access to mental health services, such as counseling and therapy, to help individuals cope with the emotional challenges of divorce.
4. Encouraging job training and placement: Individuals who are recently divorced may face significant barriers to finding employment, including a lack of job skills and experience. Social policies should prioritize providing job training and placement services to help individuals gain the skills and experience they need to find stable, well-paying jobs.
5. Providing affordable housing: Individuals who are recently divorced may face significant challenges in finding affordable housing. Social policies should prioritize providing subsidies or other forms of assistance to help individuals access safe and affordable housing.
6. Addressing discrimination: Discrimination based on gender, race, sexual orientation, and other factors can exacerbate the challenges faced by individuals who are recently divorced. Social policies should prioritize addressing discrimination and promoting inclusivity and equality for all individuals.
7. Encouraging community involvement: Social policies should prioritize encouraging community involvement and social support networks to help individuals who are recently divorced connect with others who may be facing similar
