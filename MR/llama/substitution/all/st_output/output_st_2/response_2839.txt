Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of non-binary individuals who do not identify as disabled. Here are some ways in which cultural diversity can benefit non-binary individuals:

4. Community building: Cultural diversity can help build a sense of community among non-binary individuals. By connecting with others who share similar identities and experiences, non-binary individuals can find support, validation, and belonging.
