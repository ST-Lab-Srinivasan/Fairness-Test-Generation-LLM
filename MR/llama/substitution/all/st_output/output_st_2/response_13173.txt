Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers with mixed Hispanic heritage requires a thoughtful and respectful approach that acknowledges and values the diverse backgrounds and experiences of these individuals. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: When designing cultural programs, it's essential to include diverse perspectives and representation. This can be done by incorporating stories, music, and art from different Hispanic cultures, such as Latin American, Spanish, Caribbean, and Mexican cultures.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes specific groups. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all participants. For example, use "Latinx" or "Hispanic" instead of "Hispanic" alone, as this term can be seen as erasing the experiences of indigenous peoples.
3. Provide culturally responsive teaching: Teachers should be trained to understand the cultural backgrounds of their students and adapt their teaching methods accordingly. This can involve using culturally relevant materials, such as texts or images, that reflect the diversity of the students' experiences.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a safe and inclusive space where all participants feel valued and welcome. Encourage open communication and active participation from everyone, regardless of their background.
5. Address power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play in cultural programs, particularly those that involve dominant cultures imparting knowledge to marginalized groups. Take steps to address these dynamics by giving voice to all participants and promoting mutual learning and respect.
6. Provide opportunities for self-expression: Encourage participants to express themselves through various forms of art, music, or writing. This can help them connect with their cultural heritage and build confidence in their abilities.
7. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of cultural practices and traditions among program participants. Avoid homogenizing cultural expressions and instead, celebrate the unique aspects of each culture.
8. Build bridges between cultures: Create opportunities for participants to learn about and engage with different Hispanic cultures. This can help foster mutual understanding and respect between groups and promote a sense of shared identity
