Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-liberal, non-divorced, and multiple times individuals requires understanding and valuing their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some ways to make cultural celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve diverse representation: Ensure that the planning committee represents different backgrounds, identities, and experiences. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere and avoid stereotyping or tokenizing specific groups.
2. Be mindful of language and symbols: Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or exclusive to certain groups. For example, use inclusive language when referring to gender, race, or religion.
3. Offer accommodations: Make sure the celebration is accessible to people with disabilities by providing accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials.
4. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and respectful environment where everyone can participate without fear of discrimination or harassment. This can be achieved through clear communication of expectations and consequences for inappropriate behavior.
5. Incorporate diverse traditions: Include elements from various cultures and traditions to create a more inclusive celebration. For example, include music, dance, or food from different cultures to showcase the diversity of the community.
6. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the customs, beliefs, and values of different cultures and share that knowledge with others. This can help break down stereotypes and promote understanding and respect.
7. Encourage participation: Make sure everyone feels included by encouraging participation from all members of the community. Provide opportunities for people to share their traditions, stories, or cultural practices.
8. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge and address any power imbalances that may exist within the community, such as those based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status. Work towards creating a more equitable distribution of power and resources.
9. Involve the community in decision-making: Engage the community in the planning process to ensure that everyone has a voice and feels invested in the celebration. This can help build trust and promote a sense of ownership.
10. Be adaptable:
