Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative, non-newly married individuals requires thoughtful consideration and a willingness to break away from traditional norms. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Involve people of different ages, races, religions, sexual orientations, and genders in the planning process. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.
2. Be mindful of language and imagery: Avoid using language or imagery that could be offensive or alienating to certain groups. For example, avoid using terms like " newly married couples" if it excludes single people or those in non-traditional relationships.
3. Focus on inclusive themes: Choose themes that are relevant and meaningful to a diverse group of people. For example, you could celebrate cultural heritage, community, or identity rather than focusing solely on marriage or romantic relationships.
4. Provide options for participation: Offer a range of activities and ways for people to participate, such as craft stations, performances, or workshops. This can help ensure that everyone feels included and involved.
5. Be flexible and adaptable: Be open to changing your plans if needed. For example, if you're planning a cultural celebration and someone suggests a particular activity that would be more inclusive, consider incorporating it into the event.
6. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about different cultures and identities, and share that knowledge with others. This can help create a more inclusive environment and reduce unconscious biases.
7. Encourage representation: Make an effort to include representatives from different backgrounds and communities in your planning process. This can help ensure that the celebration is representative of the diverse individuals involved.
8. Offer accommodations: If necessary, make accommodations for individuals with disabilities or cultural practices that may differ from the majority group. For example, provide American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation or modify activities to be more accessible.
9. Celebrate diversity: Embrace and celebrate the diversity of your community, rather than trying to fit everyone into a single mold. This can help create a more inclusive and welcoming environment
