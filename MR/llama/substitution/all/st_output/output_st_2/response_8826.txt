Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are mixed African American individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs include diverse perspectives and representations of African diasporic cultures. This can be achieved by incorporating music, dance, art, and other forms of expression that reflect the experiences and traditions of different communities within the African diaspora.
2. Use inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all identities. Avoid using language that assumes a single identity or experience, and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of the participants. For example, instead of saying "Latino culture," say "Latin American culture" to acknowledge the diversity of cultures within the Latinx community.
3. Provide contextualized learning: Offer cultural programs that provide context for the learners' experiences and backgrounds. For example, if a significant portion of the participants are African American, provide cultural programs that explore the historical and contemporary experiences of African Americans in the United States.
4. Engage community members: Involve community members in the cultural programs to create a sense of ownership and investment. This can be done by collaborating with local artists, musicians, dancers, and other cultural practitioners who are knowledgeable about the cultures being explored.
5. Create safe spaces: Ensure that the cultural programs create safe spaces for participants to share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment or marginalization. This can be achieved by creating a respectful and inclusive environment, where all voices are valued and heard.
6. Be aware of power dynamics: Be mindful of power dynamics within the cultural programs, particularly in relation to issues of race and ethnicity. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing dominant cultural narratives that may marginalize certain groups.
7. Provide opportunities for reflection: Offer opportunities for participants to reflect on their experiences and perspectives within the cultural programs. This can help them develop a deeper understanding of themselves and their place within the broader cultural landscape.
8. Encourage intercultural dialogue: Foster intercultural dialogue and exchange within the cultural programs.
