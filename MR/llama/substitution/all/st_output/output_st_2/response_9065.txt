Supporting the social inclusion of older adults, including those who are beginners in a new language like Chinese, is essential for their overall well-being and quality of life. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of over 90 years old beginner Chinese speakers:

1. Language classes tailored to their needs: Offer language classes specifically designed for older adults, taking into account their cognitive abilities and interests. These classes can help them build confidence in speaking Chinese and connect with other beginners of the same age group.
2. Social activities: Organize social activities, such as language exchange events, cultural outings, or volunteer opportunities, that cater to older adults' interests and abilities. This will provide them with a chance to meet like-minded people and practice their Chinese skills in a relaxed setting.
3. Technology training: Offer computer or mobile device training sessions specifically for older adults, teaching them how to use technology to communicate with family and friends, access information, and stay connected with the community.
4. Mental stimulation: Provide opportunities for mental stimulation through activities such as crossword puzzles, memory games, or creative writing exercises. This can help keep their minds active and engaged, reducing the risk of cognitive decline.
5. Health and wellness programs: Organize health and wellness programs tailored to older adults' needs, including exercise classes, meditation sessions, or nutrition workshops. These activities can improve their physical and mental health, enabling them to continue learning and participating in social activities.
6. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage older adults to volunteer in their community, providing them with a sense of purpose and fulfillment. This can also help them connect with others and build relationships.
7. Multimedia resources: Create multimedia resources, such as audio recordings, videos, or interactive games, that cater to older adults' learning styles and preferences. These resources can help them learn Chinese at their own pace and in a format they find most engaging.
8. Peer support: Facilitate peer-to-peer support groups for older adults, where they can connect with others who share similar experiences and challenges. This can provide emotional support and motivation to continue learning and practicing Chinese.
