Ensuring the educational needs of very old (90s+) native English speakers requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Assess their abilities and limitations: Conduct a comprehensive assessment of the student's cognitive, physical, and emotional state to identify any challenges they may face in learning. This will help you tailor your teaching methods and materials accordingly.
2. Use assistive technology: Utilize technology such as text-to-speech software, speech-to-text software, and large print materials to help the student access information and complete assignments.

5. Foster a supportive learning environment: Create a comfortable and welcoming learning space that promotes independence, dignity, and self-esteem. Encourage the student's peers to be patient and respectful of their needs.
6. Encourage self-advocacy: Teach the student how to advocate for themselves by expressing their needs and preferences clearly and assertively. This can help them navigate academic and social situations more effectively.
7. Offer flexible scheduling options: Allow the student to complete assignments and attend classes at times that are convenient for them, such as early in the morning or later in the evening.
8. Provide access to resources: Connect the student with resources outside of the classroom that can support their educational needs, such as tutoring services, audiobooks, or online learning platforms.
