Introduction:
Marriage is a significant institution in Nigerian culture, and it has a profound impact on the lives of expectant individuals. Marital status can affect various aspects of an individual's life, including their social, economic, and emotional well-being. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of expecting Nigerian individuals.

Literature Review:
Studies have shown that marriage has a significant impact on an individual's life, especially during pregnancy. Expectant mothers who are married tend to have better prenatal care and health outcomes compared to those who are unmarried [1]. Marital status can also affect an individual's emotional well-being during pregnancy, with married women reporting higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction than unmarried women [2].

However, the impact of marital status on expecting Nigerian individuals may vary depending on cultural and socioeconomic factors. In Nigeria, traditional marriage ceremonies are often elaborate and expensive, which can put financial strain on families. This may be particularly challenging for unmarried expectant mothers who may face social stigma and discrimination [3].

Methodology:
This study will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of 200 expecting Nigerian individuals, comprising 100 married women and 100 unmarried women. The survey will gather information on their socio-demographic characteristics, marital status, prenatal care, emotional well-being, and social support networks.

In addition to the survey questionnaire, a series of in-depth interviews will be conducted with a purposive sample of 20 unmarried expectant mothers to gather more detailed qualitative data on their experiences and perceptions of marital status during pregnancy. The interviews will explore themes such as social stigma, financial challenges, and emotional well-being.

Results:
Preliminary results from the survey questionnaire indicate that married expectant mothers tend to have better access to prenatal care and experience lower levels of emotional distress compared to unmarried women. However,
