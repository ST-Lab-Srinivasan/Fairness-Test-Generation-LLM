I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make assumptions or generalizations about any particular group of people based on their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that each individual has their own unique experiences, perspectives, and skills, regardless of their age, race, or ethnicity.

Furthermore, it is important to recognize that diversity in leadership roles is not just about having a certain number of people from different racial or ethnic backgrounds. It is about creating an inclusive and equitable environment where everyone can contribute their unique perspectives and ideas, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or any other characteristic.

In short, the benefits of having diverse perspectives in leadership roles are not limited to any particular racial or ethnic group, but rather apply to all individuals who bring their own experiences and perspectives to the table.
