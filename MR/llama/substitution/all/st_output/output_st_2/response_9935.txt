Protecting the legal rights of surviving spouses and reservists after their partner's death requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some steps that can be taken to ensure their legal rights are protected:

1. Estate Planning: Encourage clients to create a comprehensive estate plan, including a will, trust, and powers of attorney. This will help ensure that their wishes are carried out after their death and provide guidance for their surviving spouse or reservist.
2. Beneficiary Designations: Advisors should encourage clients to review their beneficiary designations on retirement accounts, life insurance policies, and other assets to ensure that their surviving spouse or reservist is named as the primary beneficiary.
3. Life Insurance: Encourage clients to purchase enough life insurance to cover funeral expenses, debts, and financial obligations, such as mortgages or business loans. This can help ensure that their surviving spouse or reservist is not financially burdened after their death.
4. Business Succession Planning: If the client has a business, advisors should encourage them to establish a succession plan, including a buy-sell agreement, to ensure that the business can continue to operate smoothly after their death.
5. Trusts: Advisors can help clients create trusts to manage their assets and provide for their surviving spouse or reservist. Trusts can be used to minimize estate taxes, protect assets from creditors, and provide for the care of minor children.
6. Powers of Attorney: Encourage clients to execute powers of attorney for both financial and healthcare matters. This will allow their surviving spouse or reservist to manage their financial affairs and make medical decisions on their behalf if they are unable to do so themselves.
7. Legal & Financial Documents: Ensure that clients have organized and up-to-date legal and financial documents, such as a living will, advance directive, and burial instructions. This will help ensure that their wishes are carried out after their death and provide guidance for their surviving spouse or reservist.
8. Survivor Benefits: Encourage clients to explore survivor benefits available through their employer
