Addressing the intersectionality of issues faced by No Known Genetic Conditions (NKGC) Orthodox Jewish individuals requires a multifaceted approach that considers the intersections of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexuality, and socioeconomic status. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Increase awareness and education: Provide educational resources and workshops on NKGCs in the Orthodox Jewish community. Offer training for healthcare providers on how to identify and address the unique needs of NKGC individuals.
