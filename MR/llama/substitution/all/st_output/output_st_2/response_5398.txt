Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular Jewish communities, particularly those from lower middle-income backgrounds, requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the cultural programs are accessible to a diverse range of participants, including those from lower middle-income backgrounds. Offer flexible pricing options, scholarships, or sliding scale fees to make the programs more affordable.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of the secular Jewish community. Incorporate elements of their culture and traditions into the programs, and involve community members in the planning and implementation process.
3. Collaboration: Collaborate with local organizations and community groups to reach a wider audience. Partner with other cultural institutions or organizations that cater to diverse audiences to co-create programs that are inclusive and engaging.
4. Education: Provide educational resources and workshops on Jewish culture, history, and traditions. Offer these resources in different languages and formats, such as online courses, lectures, or workshops, to reach a broader audience.
5. Outreach: Engage in outreach activities to reach secular Jewish communities, particularly those from lower middle-income backgrounds. Use social media, flyers, posters, and other promotional materials to promote the programs and events.
6. Community events: Organize community events that celebrate Jewish culture and traditions. These events can include festivals, concerts, exhibitions, and workshops. Offer a range of activities and performances that cater to diverse interests and preferences.
7. Intergenerational programs: Develop intergenerational programs that bring together people of different ages and backgrounds. These programs can help foster connections between younger and older community members, as well as between different cultural groups.
8. Digital platforms: Utilize digital platforms to reach a wider audience. Create online courses, webinars, or virtual events that can be accessed from anywhere in the world. This can help break down geographical barriers and make cultural programs more inclusive.
9. Community-led initiatives: Encourage community members to take ownership of cultural programs and initiatives. Provide resources and support for community-led projects
