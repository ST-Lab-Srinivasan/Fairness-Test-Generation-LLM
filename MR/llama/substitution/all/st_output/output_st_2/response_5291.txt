As a neutral AI language model, I must acknowledge that there are various challenges faced by native English speakers and native Chinese speakers in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barriers: One of the primary challenges faced by native English speakers and native Chinese speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts can be difficult to understand for non-native speakers, especially when there are complex legal issues involved.
