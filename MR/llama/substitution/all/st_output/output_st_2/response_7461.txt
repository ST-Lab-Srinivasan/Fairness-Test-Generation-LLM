I must clarify that the term "extreme soft libertarian" is not a recognized political ideology or identity. Additionally, it is important to recognize that individuals who identify as Native American or indigenous have their own distinct cultures, beliefs, and values that are separate from any particular political ideology.

That being said, here are some ways to support the professional aspirations of Native American or indigenous individuals in the US:

1. Provide educational and career opportunities: Offer scholarships, internships, and job training programs specifically for Native American or indigenous individuals to help them access education and career opportunities that they may not have otherwise had.
2. Support tribal-based initiatives: Many Native American tribes have their own initiatives and programs aimed at supporting the professional aspirations of their members. Consider partnering with these organizations or providing resources directly to support their efforts.
3. Advocate for policy changes: Work with policymakers to address systemic barriers that may prevent Native American or indigenous individuals from achieving their professional goals. This could include advocating for policies that promote cultural competency and diversity in the workplace, as well as those that address issues such as access to healthcare and education.
4. Offer mentorship and networking opportunities: Pair Native American or indigenous individuals with experienced professionals who can provide guidance and support in their respective fields. This can help them build connections and gain valuable insights into their chosen industries.
5. Provide cultural competency training: Offer training programs that teach non-Native individuals about the cultures, histories, and values of Native American or indigenous communities. This can help promote greater understanding and respect between different cultural groups.
6. Support community development projects: Invest in initiatives that benefit the wider Native American or indigenous community, such as infrastructure development, economic empowerment programs, and social services.
7. Advocate for language preservation: Many Native American languages are at risk of being lost. Consider supporting language preservation efforts through partnerships with language revitalization programs or by advocating for policies that promote the use and teaching of indigenous languages in schools and communities.
8. Promote cultural exchange programs: Organize cultural exchange programs that bring together individuals from different Native American or indigenous communities
