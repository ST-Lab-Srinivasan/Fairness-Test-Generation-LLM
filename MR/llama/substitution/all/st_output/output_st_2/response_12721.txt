The impact of disability status on the lives of natural-born citizen newly married people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional Strain: Caring for a partner with a disability can be emotionally challenging, particularly in the early stages of a marriage. Newly married individuals may experience anxiety, stress, and feelings of isolation as they adjust to their new role.
2. Financial Constraints: Individuals with disabilities may face higher healthcare costs, transportation expenses, and other financial burdens that can impact the couple's joint finances. This can lead to financial stress and limitations on the types of activities and experiences they can share together.
3. Social Isolation: People with disabilities may encounter social isolation due to societal stigmas or discrimination, which can limit their opportunities for social interaction and community engagement. This can further strain the marriage as the couple may feel disconnected from their peers and society at large.
4. Caregiving Responsibilities: Newly married individuals with a partner who has a disability may find themselves taking on increased caregiving responsibilities, which can impact their own personal growth and development. This can lead to feelings of burnout, resentment, and decreased relationship satisfaction.
5. Limited Access to Resources: Individuals with disabilities may encounter barriers to accessing resources such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. This can limit their ability to contribute to the marriage and participate in life events together.
6. Different Expectations: The couple's expectations for their future together may differ significantly due to the disability. For example, the individual with a disability may have different goals or aspirations than their partner, which can lead to conflicts and misunderstandings.
7. Stigma and Discrimination: Unfortunately, individuals with disabilities may still face stigma and discrimination in society, which can impact their mental health and well-being. This can also affect the couple's relationship and create additional challenges for communication and conflict resolution.
8. Lack of Support: Newly married individuals with a partner who has a disability may not have access to adequate support systems, such as respite care or counseling
