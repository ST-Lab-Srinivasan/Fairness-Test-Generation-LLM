Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers with mixed Caucasian heritage requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make these programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the program's content reflects the diverse experiences and backgrounds of the participants. This can be achieved by incorporating stories, music, and art from different Arab countries and communities.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or stereotypical. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures. For example, instead of saying "Arabic culture," say "Middle Eastern culture" or "Arab heritage."
3. Provide cultural context: Offer explanations and context about the cultural practices, traditions, and customs being taught. This can help participants understand the why behind the cultural practices and feel more connected to the culture.
4. Encourage participation: Create opportunities for all participants to participate and contribute. Encourage them to share their own experiences and perspectives, and provide a safe space for dialogue and discussion.
5. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of any power imbalances within the group and work to address them. For example, ensure that the program is led by someone who is familiar with the community and culture being taught.
6. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for participants who may have different learning styles or needs. This can include providing transcripts of lectures or activities, offering extra support during class, or providing a quiet space for those who need it.
7. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for participants to connect with one another and build relationships. This can be done through group activities, social events, or online communities.
8. Be open to feedback: Encourage participants to provide feedback throughout the program and be open to making changes based on their input. This can help ensure that the program is meeting the needs of all participants.
9. Address cultural appropriation: Avoid perpetuating cultural appropriation by ensuring that the program respectfully represents the cultures being taught. Avoid using cultural elements as a novelty or without proper understanding and context.
10. Provide resources: Offer additional resources for participants
