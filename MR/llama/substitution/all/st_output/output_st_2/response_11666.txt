Creating more inclusive social policies for beginner Arabic speaker devout Muslim individuals requires a thoughtful and nuanced approach that takes into account their unique needs and experiences. Here are some potential strategies that can help create a more inclusive environment:

1. Provide cultural sensitivity training for service providers: Service providers, such as teachers, healthcare professionals, and social workers, should receive training on Islamic culture and the specific needs of beginner Arabic speaker devout Muslim individuals. This will help them better understand the individual's beliefs, practices, and values, and provide more culturally sensitive care.
