Creating inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are also mixed African Americans requires careful consideration of their unique experiences and perspectives. Here are some suggestions to help make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Representation matters: Ensure that the materials and resources used in your program reflect the diversity of the community you're serving. Use images, videos, and other visual aids that showcase the experiences and cultures of mixed African Americans.
2. Be aware of power dynamics: Mixed African Americans may face discrimination and microaggressions based on their racial identity. Be mindful of these dynamics when designing your program and make sure to create a safe and inclusive space for all participants.
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Create opportunities for participants to connect with each other and build relationships. Encourage open dialogue and mutual support to help them feel more comfortable and included in the cultural programs.
4. Provide multilingual resources: Many mixed African Americans may speak multiple languages, including Arabic, English, and other languages. Providing resources in multiple languages can help ensure that all participants have access to the information and support they need.
5. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Include perspectives from a variety of cultures and communities when designing your cultural programs. This can help create a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of Arabic culture and its relevance to mixed African Americans.
6. Offer tailored support: Mixed African Americans may have unique needs and concerns when it comes to learning Arabic. Offer tailored support, such as one-on-one tutoring or small group instruction, to help them feel more comfortable and confident in their language learning journey.
7. Encourage cultural exchange: Organize cultural events and activities that allow participants to share their own cultural practices and traditions with each other. This can help foster a sense of mutual respect and appreciation for the diverse backgrounds and experiences represented in the program.
8. Provide opportunities for mentorship: Pair beginner Arabic speakers with more advanced learners or native speakers who can provide guidance, support, and encouragement throughout their language learning journey.
9. Address systemic barriers: Acknowledge any systemic barriers that may exist in the community and work to address
