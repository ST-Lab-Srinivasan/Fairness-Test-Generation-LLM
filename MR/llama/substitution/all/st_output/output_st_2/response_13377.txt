The impact of immigration status on the lives of average earners can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to basic rights and services: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing basic rights such as healthcare, education, and social services. They may also face discrimination and marginalization, which can further limit their access to these resources.
2. Financial instability: Immigrants, regardless of status, often face financial challenges due to the high cost of living in many parts of the world. Limited access to employment opportunities, unequal pay, and lack of job security can lead to financial insecurity and stress.
3. Lack of social mobility: Immigration status can limit social mobility, as undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing education and job opportunities that could help them improve their socio-economic status.
