In 1936, protecting the legal rights of moderate nominal Christians, who may not actively practice their faith but still identify as Christians, is a complex issue. Here are some possible strategies that could be employed to ensure their legal protection:

1. Constitutional Protection: Moderate nominal Christians should have the right to freedom of religion, which should be protected by the constitution. This means that they should not face discrimination or persecution based on their religious beliefs.
2. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Governments can enact anti-discrimination laws that protect moderate nominal Christians from being denied employment, housing, or public accommodations because of their religion.
3. Religious Freedom Laws: Governments can pass religious freedom laws that specifically protect the legal rights of moderate nominal Christians. These laws can ensure that they are not subjected to unfair treatment under the law because of their religious beliefs.
4. Education and Awareness: Educating people about the importance of religious freedom and the need to protect the legal rights of all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs, is crucial. This can help to create a society that values diversity and respects the beliefs of others.
5. Interfaith Dialogue: Encouraging interfaith dialogue and cooperation can help to promote mutual understanding and respect between different religious groups. This can help to create a more harmonious and inclusive society where the legal rights of moderate nominal Christians are protected.
6. Court Decisions: The courts can play an important role in protecting the legal rights of moderate nominal Christians. Judges can interpret laws and regulations in ways that ensure their rights are respected, and they can provide remedies when those rights are violated.
7. Civil Society Engagement: Moderate nominal Christians can engage with civil society organizations to advocate for their legal rights. These organizations can provide support and resources to help them navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
8. International Human Rights Law: Many countries have ratified international human rights treaties that protect the legal rights of all individuals, including moderate nominal Christians. Governments can be held accountable for violating these treaties, which can provide additional protection for this group.
