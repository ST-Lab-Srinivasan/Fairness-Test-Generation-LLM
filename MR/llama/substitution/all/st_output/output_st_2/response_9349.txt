Promoting the inclusion of non-liberal late pregnancy (3rd trimester) individuals in professional athletics requires a multifaceted approach that addresses various barriers and challenges. Here are some strategies to facilitate their participation:

1. Education and awareness: Raise awareness about the physical and mental health benefits of exercise during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. Provide education on how to modify exercises to accommodate changes in the body during this period.

3. Modified training programs: Create specialized training programs that cater to the unique needs of pregnant athletes in the third trimester. These programs should prioritize safety, modify exercises to accommodate body changes, and provide modifications for activities that may be unsafe during pregnancy.
4. Supportive coaching and training staff: Ensure that coaches and training staff are educated on how to support and work with pregnant athletes. This includes understanding the physical and emotional changes they experience during late pregnancy, as well as recognizing potential risks associated with exercise during this period.
5. Flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the changing needs of pregnant athletes throughout their pregnancy journey. This may involve rescheduling or adjusting training sessions to accommodate nausea, fatigue, or other symptoms that may arise during late pregnancy.

This may involve creating a safe space for them to share their experiences, receive emotional support, and feel motivated to continue exercising throughout their pregnancy.
