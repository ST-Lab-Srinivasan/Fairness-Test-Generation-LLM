Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of natural-born Canadian citizen mixed Asian heritage people. For many individuals, their cultural heritage serves as a source of identity, connection to their ancestors, and a way to express themselves within a society that often places a high value on homogenous cultural identities. Here are some ways cultural heritage can impact the lives of mixed Asian heritage Canadians:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging to a larger community beyond their immediate family or social circle. For example, a person of mixed Asian heritage may feel a connection to the broader Asian diaspora or to specific cultural groups within Canada.
2. Identity formation: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may face challenges in forming their identity, as they may not fit neatly into a single cultural category. Their cultural heritage can help them navigate these complexities and find a sense of self.
3. Cultural practices and traditions: Participation in cultural practices and traditions from their mixed Asian heritage can bring joy, comfort, and a sense of belonging. For example, celebrating Chinese New Year or Vietnamese Táº¿t with family and community can foster a strong connection to one's heritage.
4. Connection to ancestors: Cultural heritage can provide a means of connecting with ancestors and honoring their legacies. Mixed Asian heritage individuals may feel a deep respect for their ancestors' cultural practices and traditions, which can shape their own identity and values.
5. Community building: Cultural heritage can serve as a basis for community building among mixed Asian heritage individuals. Sharing cultural practices and traditions with others who have similar experiences can create a sense of solidarity and belonging.
6. Resilience and adaptability: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may face challenges related to their cultural identity, such as discrimination or marginalization. Cultural heritage can help them develop resilience and adaptability in the face of these challenges.
7. Intersectionality: Cultural heritage can intersect with other aspects of a person's identity, such as race, gender, sexuality, or class. Understanding the intersections of cultural heritage with these other identities can provide a more nuanced understanding of mixed Asian heritage individuals' experiences.
