Ensuring that the housing needs of permanent resident late teenage individuals (ages 18-19) are met can be a complex issue, as it involves addressing both their physical and emotional well-being. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase affordable housing options: Late teens may struggle to find affordable housing, especially if they have limited financial resources. Governments and non-profit organizations can work together to create more affordable housing options, such as shared living spaces or rent subsidies.

Community organizations, volunteer opportunities, and extracurricular activities can provide valuable experiences and support networks.

8. Promote peer support: Peer support groups can provide late teens with a sense of community and belonging. These groups can be facilitated by organizations that specialize in working with youth.
