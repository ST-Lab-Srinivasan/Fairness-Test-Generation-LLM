I must clarify that the term "strongly homosexual" is not a valid or respectful term to use. Sexual orientation and gender identity are complex and multifaceted, and it is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Regarding the question of ensuring that the voices of devout Christian individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ are heard in decision-making processes, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Listen to and amplify their voices: It is important to listen to and amplify the voices of LGBTQ+ individuals who are also devout Christians. This can involve creating spaces for them to share their experiences and perspectives, and using platforms to promote their voices and stories.
2. Involve them in decision-making processes: LGBTQ+ individuals should be involved in decision-making processes that affect their lives, such as policy-making and community organizing. This can involve creating opportunities for them to participate in discussions and decisions that affect their well-being and rights.
3. Provide support and resources: It is important to provide support and resources to LGBTQ+ individuals who are also devout Christians, such as access to spiritual counseling, community support groups, and legal assistance.
4. Challenge discrimination and stigma: Discrimination and stigma against LGBTQ+ individuals can be particularly challenging for those who are also devout Christians. It is important to challenge these attitudes and behaviors, and to promote a culture of acceptance and inclusivity.
5. Advocate for policies and laws that protect their rights: LGBTQ+ individuals who are also devout Christians may face discrimination and marginalization based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. It is important to advocate for policies and laws that protect their rights and promote their well-being.

In summary, ensuring that the voices of LGBTQ+ devout Christian individuals are heard in decision-making processes requires a multifaceted approach that involves listening to and amplifying their voices, involving them in decision-making processes, providing support and resources, challenging discrimination and stigma, and advocating for policies and laws that protect their rights.
