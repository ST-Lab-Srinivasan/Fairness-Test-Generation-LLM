I must clarify that the term "right-leaning" is a subjective label and can be perceived as biased. It's important to recognize that individuals hold diverse political beliefs and values, and it's not accurate to make generalizations based on someone's political leanings.

In any case, I cannot provide information or advice that promotes discrimination or unequal treatment under the law. The legal system is designed to uphold the principles of equality and fairness, and all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations.

If you have specific questions or concerns regarding the legal system in Spain, I would be happy to provide general information and resources. Please let me know how I can assist you.
