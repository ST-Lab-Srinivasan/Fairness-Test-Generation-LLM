4. Promote inclusion through marketing: Use marketing materials to promote the inclusivity of the event, highlighting that all are welcome and encouraged to participate.
5. Provide education and training: Offer training and education for festival staff and volunteers on how to engage with people with mental disabilities in a respectful and inclusive manner.
6. Create an accessible program: Develop a program or schedule of events that takes into account the needs of individuals with mental disabilities, including breaks and quiet areas as needed.
7. Encourage participation: Encourage individuals with mental disabilities to participate in the celebration by providing opportunities for them to lead or participate in activities or performances.
8. Foster a culture of inclusion: Encourage a culture of inclusion by promoting respectful language and behavior, and addressing any incidents of discrimination or exclusion.
9. Provide support: Offer support services such as mental health professionals, sign language interpreters, and accessible transportation to ensure that individuals with mental disabilities have the necessary resources to participate fully in the celebration.
10. Evaluate and improve: Regularly evaluate the inclusivity of the celebration and gather feedback from individuals with mental disabilities to identify areas for improvement and make necessary changes.
