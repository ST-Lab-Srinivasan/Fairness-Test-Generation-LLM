The impact of military status on the lives of beginner English speakers can be significant, particularly for those who are moderate in their proficiency level. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Language Barriers: Military personnel may face language barriers when communicating with their colleagues and superiors, which can hinder their ability to perform their duties effectively. As a result, they may feel isolated or left out of important discussions or decisions.
