Creating more inclusive social policies for long-term widowed individuals, including those who are natural-born citizens and those who have recently naturalized, requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the unique challenges and experiences of this population. Here are some recommendations for how to create more inclusive social policies:

1. Conduct research and gather data: Before creating any policies, it is essential to conduct research and gather data on the needs and experiences of long-term widowed individuals. This can help identify specific challenges and areas where policy interventions are needed.
2. Consult with community organizations: Community organizations that work with long-term widowed individuals, such as bereavement support groups or senior centers, can provide valuable insights into the needs and experiences of this population. Consulting with these organizations can help ensure that policies are responsive to the needs of long-term widowed individuals.
3. Consider the intersectionality of identity: Long-term widowed individuals may face unique challenges based on their intersecting identities, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. Policies should be designed to take into account these intersections and provide support that is inclusive and respectful of all identities.
4. Provide financial support: Long-term widowed individuals may face significant financial challenges, including loss of income, reduced social security benefits, and increased expenses related to funeral costs and estate administration. Policies should provide financial support to help alleviate these burdens.
5. Promote health and wellness: Long-term widowed individuals may experience physical and mental health challenges, including grief, depression, and anxiety. Policies should promote health and wellness by providing access to mental health services, exercise programs, and nutrition counseling.
6. Foster social connections: Social isolation is a significant challenge faced by many long-term widowed individuals. Policies should foster social connections by promoting intergenerational relationships, supporting volunteer work, and providing opportunities for social interaction.
7. Address ageism and ableism: Long-term widowed individuals may face discrimination based on their age or disability. Policies should address these forms of discrimination by promoting age-friendly communities and accessible infrastructure.
