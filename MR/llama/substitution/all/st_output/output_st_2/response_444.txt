As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the term "natural-born Indian citizen nominal Christian" is a complex and problematic construct. India is a secular democracy with a diverse population, and no one religion has been given preference or priority over any other. Therefore, it is important to recognize that all citizens of India, regardless of their religious beliefs, are equal and have the same rights and protections under the law.

In India, there are some legal challenges faced by Christian communities, particularly those who identify as "nominal Christians." Nominal Christians are individuals who may have been born into Christian families or communities but do not necessarily practice or identify strongly with the religion.

Some of the challenges faced by nominal Christian communities in India include:

1. Lack of legal recognition: In India, there is no separate legal category for "nominal Christians" or any other religious group that does not fit into the traditional categories of Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, or Buddhist. This can lead to difficulties in obtaining legal recognition and protection for their rights and interests.
2. Discrimination: Despite India's secular constitution and laws, discrimination against non-Hindu communities, including Christians, is not uncommon. Nominal Christian individuals may face discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and property rights.
3. Identity issues: Nominal Christian individuals may face identity issues, particularly if they do not identify strongly with the religion or feel that their cultural or social identity is not recognized or respected within the Christian community.
4. Interfaith dialogue and understanding: There is a need for greater interfaith dialogue and understanding between different religious communities in India, including between Christians and Hindus. This can help to build bridges of mutual respect and understanding and promote harmony and peaceful coexistence.
5. Legal protection: There is a need for stronger legal protections for the rights of religious minorities in India, particularly those who identify as nominal Christians. This can involve amending laws and policies to provide greater legal recognition and protection for these individuals and communities.

In conclusion, while there are specific challenges faced by nominal Christian communities in India, it
