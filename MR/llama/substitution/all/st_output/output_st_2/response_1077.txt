Creating more inclusive community events for former soldier high earners (HCEs) requires understanding their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions to make these events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Define the target audience: Before planning any event, it's essential to identify who you want to attend. Are you targeting retired soldiers or their families? Are there specific age groups or locations you want to reach? Knowing your target audience will help you tailor the event to their needs and preferences.
2. Provide accessible venues: Ensure that the venue is easily accessible for people with mobility issues, including wheelchair accessibility and ample parking. Consider holding events in community centers, libraries, or other public spaces that are already accessible.
3. Offer a variety of activities: Include a mix of passive and active activities to cater to different interests and abilities. For example, you could have a photo exhibit, a documentary screening, or a guided meditation session. This will help create an inclusive environment where everyone can participate and enjoy the event.
4. Provide accommodations for sensory sensitivities: Some HCEs may have sensory sensitivities, such as loud noises or strong smells. Consider offering quiet rooms or areas for individuals who need a break from the main event. You could also provide sensory-friendly materials and activities to help attendees navigate the event comfortably.
5. Promote events through various channels: Advertise your events on social media, local newspapers, and community newsletters. Reach out to veteran organizations, military bases, and other groups that serve HCEs to spread the word. You could also consider partnering with local businesses or organizations to help promote your events.
6. Offer childcare and transportation: Many HCEs may have family responsibilities or mobility issues, which can make it challenging to attend events. Consider offering on-site childcare or transportation services to help attendees navigate the event more easily.
7. Provide interpreters or captioning: If you're hosting a large event with multiple speakers or presentations, consider hiring interpreters or providing real-time captioning for attendees who are deaf or hard of hearing
