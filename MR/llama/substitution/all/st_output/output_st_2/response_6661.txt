To ensure that the educational needs of beginner Spanish speakers who are newly married students are met, here are some strategies and recommendations:

1. Assess their language proficiency level: Conduct a language proficiency assessment to determine the students' current level of Spanish proficiency. This will help the teacher tailor the instruction to meet the students' needs and abilities.
2. Use interactive and engaging teaching methods: Incorporate interactive and engaging teaching methods, such as role-playing, group discussions, and multimedia presentations, to keep the students motivated and involved in the learning process.
3. Provide opportunities for authentic language use: Encourage the students to use Spanish in real-life situations, such as ordering food at a restaurant or shopping at a store. This will help them develop their speaking and listening skills in a practical context.
4. Offer tailored support and feedback: Provide individualized support and feedback to help the students improve their language skills. For example, provide corrective feedback on pronunciation and grammar, and offer suggestions for improvement.
5. Encourage peer-to-peer learning: Encourage the students to learn from each other by engaging in peer-to-peer language exchange activities. This can help them develop their speaking and listening skills in a more relaxed and enjoyable setting.
6. Use technology-based resources: Utilize technology-based resources, such as language learning apps, podcasts, and online courses, to supplement the students' learning experience. These resources can provide additional practice opportunities and feedback outside of the classroom.
7. Provide opportunities for cultural immersion: Offer opportunities for the students to immerse themselves in Spanish-speaking cultures through activities such as attending a Spanish film festival, participating in a cooking class, or visiting a Spanish market. This can help them develop a deeper understanding of the language and its cultural context.
8. Encourage self-directed learning: Encourage the students to take ownership of their learning by setting goals and tracking their progress. Provide resources and support for self-directed learning, such as language learning apps or online courses.
