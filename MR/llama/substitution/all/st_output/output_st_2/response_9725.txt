Cultural exchange plays a significant role in fostering understanding between Mandarin native-born US citizen groups. Here are some ways cultural exchange can promote understanding:

1. Shared experiences: Cultural exchange programs provide opportunities for individuals from different backgrounds to share experiences and learn from each other.
