Creating more inclusive social policies for partnered permanent resident individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive social policies:

1. Recognize the value of diverse families: Societal attitudes and policies often fail to recognize the diversity of families, including those with same-sex parents, interracial couples, and blended families. Policies should be designed to recognize and support the unique needs of these families, such as access to parental leave, childcare, and adoption services.
2. Address discrimination based on immigration status: Many partnered permanent residents face discrimination based on their immigration status, which can limit their access to social services and opportunities. Policies should be designed to address this discrimination and provide equal access to services for all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
3. Provide affordable housing: Access to affordable and secure housing is essential for the well-being of partnered permanent residents. Policies should prioritize the development and preservation of affordable housing options, particularly in areas with high demand and limited supply.
4. Promote financial inclusion: Many partnered permanent residents face financial insecurity due to limited access to credit, savings, and other financial services. Policies should aim to promote financial inclusion by providing access to affordable financial products and services, such as bank accounts, loans, and investment opportunities.
5. Support mental health and well-being: The immigration process can be stressful and traumatic for many individuals, particularly those who have experienced violence, discrimination, or other forms of trauma in their home countries. Policies should prioritize mental health support services for partnered permanent residents, including access to counseling, therapy, and other mental health resources.

Policies should aim to foster community engagement by providing opportunities for social interaction, cultural exchange, and volunteer work.
7. Advocate for equal employment opportunities: Partnered permanent residents may face discrimination in the workplace due to their immigration status or other forms
