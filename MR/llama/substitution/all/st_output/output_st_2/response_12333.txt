As a language model, I cannot provide legal or political advice. However, I can suggest some potential legislative changes that could benefit native French speaker active-duty communities:

1. Language Support Services: Providing language support services such as interpretation and translation for military personnel and their families could help bridge the language gap and ensure they receive equal access to resources and opportunities.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offering cultural sensitivity training for military leaders and personnel could help them better understand and respect the unique cultural practices and traditions of native French speaker communities.
3. Language Proficiency Testing: Developing standardized language proficiency tests for native French speakers in the military could help identify areas where they need improvement and provide a framework for measuring progress.
4. Bilingual Education Programs: Establishing bilingual education programs for military children could help them maintain their native language skills while also adapting to the U.S. military culture.
5. Language Immersion Programs: Providing language immersion programs for military personnel could help them improve their proficiency in the target language and better perform their duties.
6. Workplace Accommodations: Offering workplace accommodations such as flexible scheduling or telecommuting options for native French speakers could help them balance their work and family responsibilities while also preserving their cultural identity.
7. Language Accessibility: Ensuring that language accessibility requirements are met for native French speakers in the military, such as providing translation services for important documents or meetings, could help remove language barriers and ensure equal access to opportunities.
8. Military Education: Developing educational programs that cater to the needs of native French speaker active-duty communities could help them advance their careers while also preserving their cultural identity.
9. Language Preservation: Establishing programs to preserve the language and culture of native French speakers in the military could help ensure that these valuable assets are passed down to future generations.
10. Community Outreach: Building partnerships with local organizations and communities that cater to native French speaker active-duty communities could help foster a sense of belonging and support, which is essential for their well-being and success.

It's important to note that these are just potential legislative changes and may not
