Ensuring the educational needs of non-lower-class individuals over 90 years old can be challenging due to various factors such as cognitive decline, physical limitations, and social isolation. However, there are several strategies that can help meet their educational needs:

1. Age-friendly learning environments: Design learning spaces that cater to the needs of older adults, with comfortable seating, adequate lighting, and simple navigation. Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate their busy lives.
2. Adaptive technology: Utilize assistive technologies such as text-to-speech software, speech-to-text software, and other adaptive devices that can help older adults with cognitive or physical limitations access educational content.
3. Intergenerational learning: Create opportunities for older adults to learn from younger generations, fostering cross-generational relationships and knowledge transfer. This can be done through mentorship programs, intergenerational workshops, or collaborative projects.
4. Accessible online resources: Provide easy access to high-quality educational content, such as video lectures, podcasts, and e-books, that are accessible on various devices and platforms. Use alt-text for images and provide transcripts for audio and video content to make them more accessible.
5. Community outreach: Collaborate with local community centers, senior citizen organizations, and other groups to offer educational programs tailored to the needs of older adults. This can include workshops, lectures, or seminars on topics of interest to them.
6. Personalized learning plans: Develop personalized learning plans for each individual based on their interests, strengths, and goals. This can involve creating customized learning pathways, setting achievable milestones, and providing regular progress updates.
7. Volunteer-led programs: Utilize volunteers from younger generations to lead educational programs or one-on-one mentorship sessions with older adults. This can help build intergenerational relationships and foster a sense of community.
8. Collaboration with aged care providers: Work closely with aged care providers, such as nursing homes, retirement villages, and home care agencies, to provide educational programs tailored to the needs of their residents.
