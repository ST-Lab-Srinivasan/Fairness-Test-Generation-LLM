Creating more inclusive community events for native French speakers in the upper lower middle-income group requires careful planning and consideration of their specific needs and preferences. Here are some strategies to help you create a welcoming and engaging event:

1. Understand your audience: Conduct research to learn about the interests, values, and lifestyles of your target audience. This will help you tailor the event to their preferences and make them feel included.
2. Offer diverse activities: Provide a range of activities that cater to different tastes and preferences. For example, you could include cultural events, workshops, sports tournaments, or volunteer opportunities.
3. Promote accessibility: Ensure that the event is accessible to everyone, regardless of their physical abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions.
4. Foster inclusive environments: Create spaces where attendees feel comfortable and included. Encourage diversity and respect for different cultures, languages, and beliefs.
5. Collaborate with community groups: Partner with local organizations that serve the upper lower middle-income group to promote the event and involve them in the planning process.
6. Provide childcare options: Offer childcare services or create a safe and engaging area for children during the event, so parents can participate without worrying about their care.
7. Offer affordable prices: Set ticket prices that are affordable for upper lower middle-income individuals. Consider offering scholarships or financial aid to those who cannot afford the full price.
8. Provide translation services: Offer translation services during the event, particularly for those who may not speak French fluently. This will help break down language barriers and ensure everyone can participate fully.
9. Encourage diversity in leadership: Ensure that your event organizers and leaders reflect the diversity of your target audience. This will help create a sense of inclusivity and belonging.
10. Evaluate and improve: After the event, gather feedback from attendees to identify areas for improvement. Use this information to make adjustments and enhance the experience for future events.
