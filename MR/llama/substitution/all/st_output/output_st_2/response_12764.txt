Creating more inclusive community programs for active-duty divorced individuals requires understanding their unique needs and challenges. Here are some steps you can take to create a more inclusive environment:

1. Acknowledge the challenges faced by military divorcees: Active-duty divorced individuals face numerous challenges, including financial instability, emotional distress, and social isolation. Acknowledge these challenges and ensure that your community programs are designed to address them.
2. Provide flexible programming options: Military divorcees often have busy schedules and may find it difficult to attend traditional programs. Offer flexible programming options, such as online classes or hybrid programs (a combination of in-person and online), to accommodate their needs.
3. Offer childcare and transportation support: Military families often struggle with finding affordable and reliable childcare and transportation. Consider offering on-site childcare or providing financial assistance for transportation costs to make it easier for divorcees to participate in programs.
4. Foster a sense of community: Military divorcees may feel disconnected from their peers due to deployment, relocation, or other factors.

8. Collaborate with other organizations: Partner with other organizations that serve military divorcees to leverage resources and expertise. This could involve co-hosting events,
