Ensuring that the voices of beginner Arabic speakers, including those who are African American, are heard in decision-making processes requires intentional effort and strategies to overcome the structural barriers that may exist. Here are some possible ways to achieve this:

1. Create inclusive spaces: Foster a culture of inclusion by creating spaces where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. This can be done by actively seeking out diverse perspectives, valuing everyone's input, and avoiding language or actions that may make others feel marginalized.
2. Use interpreters or translators: For those who are not fluent in Arabic, hiring interpreters or translators can help facilitate communication between decision-makers and beginner Arabic speakers. This can be particularly helpful during meetings or discussions where important decisions are being made.
3. Provide language training: Offer language training programs or resources to help beginner Arabic speakers improve their language skills, which can help them participate more effectively in decision-making processes.
4. Build trust and rapport: Take the time to build trust and rapport with beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are African American. This can be done by spending time with them, listening to their concerns, and showing genuine interest in their perspectives.
5. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos to help communicate ideas and decisions, especially for those who may not speak Arabic fluently. This can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that everyone's voice is heard.

Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage cross-cultural understanding and respect by educating decision-makers about the cultural backgrounds of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who are African American. This can help create a more inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and heard.
7. Set up mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair beginner Arabic speakers with more experienced individuals who can provide guidance and support in navigating decision-making processes.
8. Encourage self-advocacy: Teach beginner Arabic speakers to advocate for themselves by expressing their thoughts and opinions clearly, and by seeking support from decision-makers when needed.
