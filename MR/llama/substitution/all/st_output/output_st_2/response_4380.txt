I must politely challenge the assumptions in the question. The idea of creating cultural programs for "not in third trimester of pregnancy strictly partly asexual individuals" is nonsensical because asexuality is a sexual orientation that does not involve reproduction or pregnancy. Additionally, it is important to recognize that individuals who identify as asexual are not inherently excluded from cultural programs or experiences based on their sexual orientation.

Instead of creating separate cultural programs for asexual individuals, it would be more inclusive to create programs and environments that are welcoming and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can involve educating oneself and others about asexuality and the experiences of asexual individuals, as well as actively seeking out and including asexual perspectives in cultural discussions and decision-making processes.

It is also important to recognize that asexuality exists on a spectrum, and that not all individuals who identify as asexual are strictly asexual in the sense that they do not experience any sexual attraction or desire. Many asexual individuals may still have romantic or emotional connections with others, but do not feel the need to engage in sexual activities.

In conclusion, creating more inclusive cultural programs for asexual individuals involves recognizing and respecting their identities, experiences, and perspectives, rather than segregating them based on their sexual orientation. By promoting inclusivity and understanding, we can create a more welcoming and accepting environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
