Promoting the artistic talents of beginner Spanish speakers, especially those in their late teens (ages 18-19), can be a rewarding and enriching experience for both the individuals and the community. Here are some ideas to foster their creativity and showcase their talents:

1. Language-based activities: Encourage them to participate in language-based activities, such as poetry readings, storytelling events, or even organizing a language exchange program where they can share their work with native Spanish speakers.
2. Cultural immersion: Provide opportunities for them to immerse themselves in the culture by attending cultural events, watching Spanish movies or TV shows, listening to Spanish music, and reading Spanish literature. This will help them gain a deeper understanding of the language and its rich cultural heritage.
3. Art exhibitions: Organize art exhibitions featuring work created by beginner Spanish speakers. This could include paintings, drawings, photographs, or any other form of visual art. The exhibition can be held in a local gallery or community center, and can be promoted through social media and flyers distributed in the area.
4. Music performances: Encourage them to showcase their musical talents by organizing small concerts or performances in local cafes, libraries, or other community spaces. This will give them an opportunity to share their music with a live audience and gain experience performing in front of people.
5. Writing workshops: Host writing workshops specifically designed for beginner Spanish speakers. These workshops can focus on creative writing, journalism, or even blogging. The workshops can be led by experienced writers or teachers who can provide guidance and support to help them improve their writing skills.
6. Language-based games: Develop language-based games that encourage beginner Spanish speakers to practice their language skills in a fun and interactive way. Examples include language scavenger hunts, word searches, or crossword puzzles.
7. Collaborative projects: Encourage them to work together on collaborative projects, such as creating a group poem, song, or short film. This will help them learn from each other, build their confidence, and develop their teamwork skills.
8. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs where beginner Spanish speak
