Infant females who are not early pregnant (i.e., in the 1st trimester) face several challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Lack of attention and care: Infant females may not receive adequate attention and care from healthcare providers during this critical period, especially if they are not pregnant or have a non-urgent medical condition.
2. Delayed diagnosis and treatment: Delays in diagnosing and treating medical conditions can lead to serious complications, especially for infant females who may be more susceptible to certain health issues due to their age and sex.
3. Limited access to gender-specific care: Infant females may not have access to gender-specific care and resources, which can impact their health outcomes and quality of life.
4. Misdiagnosis and mistreatment: Infant females may be at risk of misdiagnosis or mistreatment due to inadequate training or biases among healthcare providers.
