As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to respect and recognize the identity and experiences of all individuals, including those who identify as pansexual. Pansexual individuals face unique challenges and issues in society, which can be exacerbated by discrimination and marginalization. Here are some ways data can be used to highlight these issues:

1. Conduct surveys or studies: Collecting data through surveys or studies can provide valuable insights into the experiences of pansexual individuals. For example, you could survey pansexual individuals about their experiences with discrimination, stigma, and marginalization. You could also ask about their access to healthcare, education, and other resources that are important for overall well-being.
2. Analyze social media data: Social media can provide a wealth of data on the experiences of pansexual individuals. For example, you could analyze Twitter hashtags related to pansexuality, or use sentiment analysis tools to gauge the tone of online discussions about pansexuality. This can help identify areas where pansexual individuals face discrimination or marginalization.
3. Examine legal data: Laws and policies that affect pansexual individuals can have a significant impact on their well-being. For example, you could analyze the extent to which pansexual individuals are protected from discrimination in employment, housing, and other areas. This can help identify areas where legal protections are needed.
4. Use data visualization tools: Data visualization tools can help present complex data in an easy-to-understand format. For example, you could use a map to show the location of pansexual individuals who have faced discrimination or marginalization, or create a graph to illustrate the number of incidents of discrimination over time.
5. Collaborate with organizations: Working with organizations that support pansexual individuals can help ensure that data is collected and analyzed in an ethical and responsible manner. These organizations can also provide valuable insights into the experiences of pansexual individuals and help identify areas where data can be used to improve their well-being.

It's important to note that when collecting or analyzing data related to pansexual individuals, it's essential to prioritize ethical consider
