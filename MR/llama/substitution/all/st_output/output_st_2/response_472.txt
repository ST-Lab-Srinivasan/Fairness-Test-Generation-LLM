8. Adaptive assessments: Use adaptive assessments that adjust their level of difficulty and content based on a student's performance. This ensures that non-traditional students are challenged appropriately and receive feedback tailored to their needs.
9. Blended learning: Offer blended learning options, combining online and in-person instruction, to cater to the diverse needs of non-traditional students.
