Ensuring the healthcare needs of financially disadvantaged Mexican people is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some potential strategies that could be implemented to address this challenge:

1. Increase access to healthcare services: Financially disadvantaged individuals may face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to lack of insurance, limited financial resources, or geographic isolation. Governments and NGOs can work together to establish clinics and healthcare facilities in underserved areas, provide transportation to healthcare services, and offer sliding fee scales based on income.
2. Improve primary care: Primary care is often the first point of contact for individuals seeking healthcare services. Ensuring that there are adequate primary care providers in financially disadvantaged communities can help identify health issues early on and prevent more severe conditions from developing. Governments and NGOs can work together to provide training and resources to primary care providers serving these communities.
3. Expand mental health services: Mental health issues are prevalent in Mexico, and financially disadvantaged individuals may be less likely to access mental health services due to lack of insurance or stigma. Governments and NGOs can work together to provide mental health services in underserved areas, offer sliding fee scales based on income, and reduce the stigma associated with seeking mental health treatment.
4. Address social determinants of health: Social determinants of health, such as poverty, education, housing, and employment, have a significant impact on an individual's overall health. Governments and NGOs can work together to address these issues by providing access to affordable housing, improving education, and offering job training programs.

Governments and NGOs can work together to promote preventive care by providing free or low-cost screenings, vaccinations, and other preventive measures in underserved communities.
6. Address cultural barriers: Cultural barriers can prevent individuals from seeking healthcare services. Governments and NGOs can work together to address these barriers by providing culturally sensitive care, interpreters, and translated materials.
7. Leverage technology: Technology can
