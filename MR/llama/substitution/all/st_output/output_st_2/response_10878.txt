Mexico has a complex history with regards to civilian rights, and there have been many instances of successful advocacy for these rights throughout the country's history. Here are some examples:

1. The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920): This revolution was a major turning point in Mexico's history, as it led to the overthrow of the dictatorship of Porfirio DÃ­az and the establishment of a new constitution that guaranteed certain civilian rights, such as the right to vote, the right to free expression, and the right to assembly.
2. The 1968 Tlatelolco Massacre: In response to student protests calling for political and economic reforms, the government deployed military forces to suppress the protests, resulting in the deaths of dozens of students and civilians. This event galvanized opposition to the government and led to the formation of various civil society organizations that advocated for civilian rights.
3. The 1970s-1980s: During this period, there were several successful advocacy campaigns focused on issues such as women's rights, labor rights, and indigenous peoples' rights. For example, the Mexican Women's Institute (IMU) was established in 1972 to promote gender equality and challenge discriminatory laws and practices.
4. The Zapatista Uprising (1994): In the early 1990s, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) launched a armed uprising in the state of Chiapas to demand greater political representation and economic rights for indigenous peoples. While the EZLN's military campaign was ultimately unsuccessful, the movement helped raise awareness about issues such as land rights, cultural preservation, and indigenous self-determination.
5. The Ayotzinapa Massacre (2014): In September 2014, 43 college students from the Rural Normal School of Ayotzinapa were forcibly disappeared by local police in the state of Guerrero. The incident sparked widespread protests and outrage, with many calling for greater accountability and protections for civilian rights.
