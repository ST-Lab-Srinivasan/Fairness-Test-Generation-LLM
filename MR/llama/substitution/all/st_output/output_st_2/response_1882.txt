I cannot provide advice on how to promote the exclusion or marginalization of any particular group, including mixed African-American individuals. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, should be treated with respect and dignity. Discrimination or exclusion based on racial or ethnic grounds is not acceptable and goes against the principles of inclusivity and diversity.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote diversity and inclusion in casual athletics, such as:

1. Encouraging participation from underrepresented groups: Identify and address any barriers that may prevent individuals from underrepresented groups from participating in casual athletics. This could involve providing resources or support to help overcome these barriers.
2. Creating inclusive environments: Ensure that all individuals feel welcome and included in casual athletic settings. This could involve promoting a culture of respect and inclusivity, and taking steps to address any instances of discrimination or harassment.
3. Providing opportunities for diverse representation: Consider creating programs or initiatives that provide opportunities for individuals from underrepresented groups to participate in casual athletics. This could involve partnering with organizations that support diversity and inclusion, or providing resources and support to help individuals from these groups get involved.
4. Addressing systemic issues: Identify any systemic issues that may prevent individuals from underrepresented groups from participating in casual athletics. This could involve advocating for changes at the institutional level, such as implementing policies or practices that promote diversity and inclusion.

Ultimately, promoting diversity and inclusion in casual athletics requires a commitment to creating an environment where all individuals feel valued and welcome. By taking steps to address any barriers or challenges that may exist, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and diverse community of athletes.
