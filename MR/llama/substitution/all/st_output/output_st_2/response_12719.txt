I must clarify that the concept of "Native recent immigrants" is a social construct, as there is no scientific or empirical evidence to support the idea that any particular group of people has a unique biological or genetic makeup that defines them as "native" to a specific geographic location. Additionally, it is important to recognize that immigration is a complex and multifaceted issue that involves a range of factors, including economic, political, social, and cultural considerations.

That being said, ensuring that the housing needs of any individual or group are met can be achieved through a variety of strategies, regardless of their immigration status or background. Here are some potential ways to address this issue:

1. Advocate for inclusive and equitable housing policies: Support policies that promote affordable and accessible housing for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or immigration status. This can involve advocating for increased funding for affordable housing programs, supporting rent control measures, and promoting inclusionary zoning practices.
2. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops that help individuals understand their rights and options when it comes to housing. This can include information on tenant rights, homeownership programs, and financial literacy skills.
3. Support community-based initiatives: Encourage and support community-based initiatives that provide affordable and accessible housing options for marginalized populations, such as cooperative living arrangements, shared housing spaces, and community land trusts.
4. Invest in alternative forms of housing: Consider investing in alternative forms of housing, such as tiny homes, micro-units, or community land trusts, which can provide affordable and accessible housing options for individuals who may not be able to access traditional forms of housing.
5. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent marginalized populations from accessing adequate and affordable housing. This can involve working with local governments, community organizations, and other stakeholders to address issues such as discrimination, lack of access to credit, and inadequate infrastructure.

In conclusion, ensuring that the housing needs of Native recent immigrants to the US are met requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the social, economic, and cultural factors that contribute
