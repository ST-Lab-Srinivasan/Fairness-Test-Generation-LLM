To promote the educational success of Mexican students who are not disabled, there are several strategies that can be implemented. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide access to quality education: Ensure that all Mexican students have access to quality educational resources, including well-trained teachers, up-to-date textbooks and technology, and modern facilities. This will help them stay engaged and motivated in their studies.
2. Encourage a supportive learning environment: Create a learning environment that is conducive to student success. This can be achieved by fostering a culture of respect, inclusivity, and mutual support among students.
3. Offer extracurricular activities: Provide opportunities for students to engage in extracurricular activities that promote personal growth and development, such as sports, music, art, and volunteer work. This can help them develop their interests and talents outside of the classroom.
4. Address language barriers: For Mexican students who may be English language learners, provide additional support and resources to help them overcome language barriers and succeed in their academic studies.
5. Promote cultural understanding: Encourage students to appreciate and value their cultural heritage and background. This can involve incorporating elements of Mexican culture into the curriculum or encouraging students to share their cultural practices and traditions with their peers.
6. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage students to view challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than as threats to their ego or self-worth. This can help them develop resilience and perseverance in the face of obstacles.
7. Provide mental health support: Offer counseling services or mental health resources to students who may be struggling with anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues. This can help them manage their emotions and stay motivated in their academic studies.
8. Encourage family involvement: Involve parents and guardians in the educational process by providing opportunities for them to engage in school activities, attend parent-teacher conferences, and receive regular updates on their child's progress. This can help foster a sense of community and support around the student.
9. Provide financial support: Offer financial aid or scholarships to students who may be struggling to afford educational resources or expenses.
