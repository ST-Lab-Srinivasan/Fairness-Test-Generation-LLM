Supporting the social inclusion of beginner French speakers who are separated can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language classes: Provide beginner French language classes specifically designed for separated individuals. This will help them improve their language skills and feel more comfortable in social situations.
2. Social events: Organize social events where beginners can practice their French skills in a relaxed atmosphere, such as language exchange events, potluck dinners, or movie nights.
3. Language buddies: Pair beginners with experienced French speakers who can act as language buddies and provide support and encouragement.
4. Cultural activities: Encourage separated individuals to participate in cultural activities such as cooking classes, art workshops, or music lessons, which can help them connect with other French speakers and learn about French culture.
5. Volunteer opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities where beginners can practice their French skills while giving back to the community. This could include volunteering at a local non-profit organization or participating in a community event.
6. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs where experienced French speakers can mentor beginners and provide guidance on how to navigate social situations and improve their language skills.
7. Online resources: Provide access to online resources such as language learning apps, podcasts, and videos that can help beginners improve their French skills at their own pace.
8. Support groups: Facilitate support groups where beginners can share their experiences and connect with other individuals who are going through similar challenges.
9. Networking events: Organize networking events where beginners can meet other French speakers and practice their language skills in a professional setting.
10. Intercultural dialogue: Encourage intercultural dialogue by organizing events that bring together people from different cultural backgrounds to share their experiences and perspectives.

By implementing these strategies, you can help support the social inclusion of beginner French speakers who are separated and provide them with the opportunity to improve their language skills and connect with other individuals in a welcoming and inclusive environment.
