Native Spanish speakers may face several challenges in the healthcare system, including:

1. Language barriers: Limited proficiency in English or other languages spoken by healthcare providers can create communication difficulties, leading to misunderstandings or missed diagnoses.
2. Cultural differences: Different cultural backgrounds and beliefs can affect how patients perceive and interact with the healthcare system, potentially leading to delays or non-adherence to treatment plans.
