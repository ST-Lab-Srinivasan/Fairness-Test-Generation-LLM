Creating more inclusive community events for low-income, native English speakers can be achieved by following these steps:

1. Understand the needs and interests of the target audience: Conduct research to identify the specific needs and interests of the low-income, native English speakers in your community. This will help you tailor your events to meet their needs and make them more appealing.
2. Provide accessibility: Ensure that your events are accessible to people with disabilities by providing wheelchair accessibility, American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, and other accommodations as needed.
3. Offer childcare and transportation: Provide free or low-cost childcare and transportation services to make it easier for low-income individuals to attend events.
4. Promote events through multiple channels: Advertise your events through a variety of channels, including social media, local newspapers, flyers, and word of mouth. This will help reach a wider audience and ensure that low-income individuals are aware of the events.
5. Offer free or low-cost events: Consider offering free or low-cost events to make them more accessible to low-income individuals. This could include community festivals, cultural events, and educational workshops.
6. Partner with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve low-income communities to help promote your events and reach a wider audience.
7. Provide language support: If English is not the primary language spoken in the community, consider providing translation services or offering events in multiple languages to make them more inclusive.
8. Involve the community in event planning: Involve low-income individuals in the planning and decision-making process for events to ensure that they are relevant and meaningful to their needs and interests.
9. Focus on cultural diversity: Celebrate the cultural diversity of the community by incorporating traditional music, dance, and food into your events. This can help create a more inclusive atmosphere and make low-income individuals feel more comfortable attending.
