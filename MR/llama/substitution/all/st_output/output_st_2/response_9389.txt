I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality, including the idea of an "elite upper-class" based on race or ethnicity. All individuals, regardless of their background or identity, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead of focusing on ways to support a particular group of people based on their race or ethnicity, it's important to address the systemic inequalities that exist in society. This can involve working towards policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, such as:

1. Educational opportunities: Ensuring that all individuals have access to quality education, regardless of their background or identity, can help level the playing field and provide equal opportunities for success.
2. Economic empowerment: Addressing economic inequalities through policies that promote fair wages, job training programs, and access to capital and resources can help individuals from marginalized communities build wealth and achieve financial stability.
3. Representation and inclusion: Encouraging diversity and representation in leadership positions, decision-making roles, and other areas of influence can help ensure that the voices and perspectives of all individuals are heard and valued.
4. Addressing systemic racism: Recognizing and addressing the ways in which systemic racism operates in society, such as through discriminatory policies and practices, can help to create a more equitable and inclusive environment for everyone.

By working towards these goals, we can create a more just and equitable society where all individuals have the opportunity to thrive and succeed, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
