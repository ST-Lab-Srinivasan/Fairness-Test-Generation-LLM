3. Job Creation and Entrepreneurship: Support the creation of job opportunities and entrepreneurial ventures that cater to the needs of mixed Asian heritage communities. This can include initiatives that provide mentorship, training, and resources to help individuals start their own businesses or find employment in industries that reflect their cultural background.
4. Community Building: Foster a sense of community and belonging among mixed Asian heritage lower-class individuals by providing opportunities for socialization, networking, and cultural expression.

This can involve working with government agencies, community organizations, and other stakeholders to push for policies that promote equity and inclusion.
6. Addressing Intersectionality: Recognize the interconnected nature of social identities (e.g., race, gender, sexuality) and address how they intersect to produce unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization.
