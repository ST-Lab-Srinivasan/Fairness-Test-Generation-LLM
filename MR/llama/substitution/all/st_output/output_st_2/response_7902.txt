Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-liberal beginner Chinese speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the public space is accessible to all, including those who may not be proficient in Mandarin or other dominant languages. Provide interpretation services, such as sign language interpreters, for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Visual aids: Use visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, and videos to help non-Mandarin speakers understand the information being presented. This can be especially helpful for individuals with limited literacy skills.
3. Simplified language: Use simpler language and avoid jargon or technical terms that may be unfamiliar to non-Mandarin speakers. Provide explanations or definitions for key terms when necessary.
4. Multilingual communication: Encourage multilingual communication by providing translated materials, such as brochures, flyers, and signage. Use visual cues, such as pictures or symbols, to help convey information.
5. Cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural backgrounds of non-Mandarin speakers. Avoid making assumptions about their language proficiency or cultural practices based on their appearance or ethnicity.
6. Flexibility: Be flexible in your communication style and adapt to the needs of different individuals. For example, some individuals may prefer written information, while others may prefer verbal communication.
7. Collaboration: Collaborate with community organizations or language groups that serve non-Mandarin speaking populations. This can help ensure that public spaces are inclusive and accessible to a diverse range of individuals.
8. Technology: Leverage technology, such as mobile apps or online platforms, to provide information and services in multiple languages. This can help reach a broader audience and make public spaces more inclusive.
9. Training: Provide training for staff and volunteers on how to communicate with non-Mandarin speakers, including cultural sensitivity and language accessibility.
10. Feedback mechanisms: Establish feedback mechanisms to gather input from non-Mandarin speaking individuals on their experiences in public spaces. Use this feedback to identify areas for improvement and make adjustments as needed.
