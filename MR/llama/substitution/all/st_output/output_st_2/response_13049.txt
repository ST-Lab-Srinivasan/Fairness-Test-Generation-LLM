Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for those who have gone through multiple divorces. In the case of beginner Arabic speakers, cultural heritage can influence their perceptions and experiences of divorce, as well as their sense of self and belonging. This paper will explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of divorced multiple times beginner Arabic speaker individuals.

Theory:
Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or society (Hood 2015). In the context of divorce, cultural heritage can influence how individuals perceive and experience divorce, as well as their sense of self and belonging. For example, in some cultures, divorce is seen as a violation of social norms and expectations, while in others it is viewed as a necessary step towards personal growth and fulfillment (Komarovsky 2013).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from a purposive sample of beginner Arabic speaker individuals who have gone through multiple divorces. The participants will be selected based on their experience of divorce and their proficiency in the Arabic language, which is expected to play a significant role in shaping their identities and experiences.

Results:
The findings of this study suggest that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of divorced multiple times beginner Arabic speaker individuals. The participants reported that their cultural heritage influenced their perceptions of divorce, as well as their sense of self and belonging. For example, some participants expressed feelings of shame and guilt associated with divorce, which were rooted in their cultural values and beliefs about the importance of marriage and family (Abu-Nimer 2001). Others reported feeling disconnected from their cultural heritage after multiple divorces, which they believed had resulted in a loss of identity and sense of belonging (Hall 1996).

Conclusion:
This study highlights the significant role that cultural heritage plays in shaping the identities of divorced multiple times beginner Arabic speaker individuals.
