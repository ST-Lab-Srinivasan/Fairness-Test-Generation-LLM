Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Happily Long-Time Married Native Chinese Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for those who have been married for many years. In China, where the population is predominantly ethnic Han, cultural heritage has been passed down through generations and continues to influence contemporary society. This study examines the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of happily long-time married native Chinese speakers.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have highlighted the impact of cultural heritage on identity formation, particularly among ethnic minority groups (Harding, 2013). However, less is known about how cultural heritage shapes the identities of native Chinese speakers. Research has shown that cultural heritage can influence identity through various means, such as shared values, beliefs, and practices (Gao, 2016). For instance, the Confucian ideals of filial piety, respect for authority, and social hierarchy have been deeply ingrained in Chinese culture and continue to shape the identities of many Chinese individuals.

Methodology:
This study employs a qualitative research design, with in-depth interviews conducted with 20 happily long-time married native Chinese speakers. Participants were selected based on their marital duration (minimum of 20 years) and linguistic proficiency (fluent in Mandarin). Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, with thematic analysis conducted to identify key themes related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities.

Findings:
Four primary themes emerged from the data analysis: (1) Cultural heritage as a source of identity formation, (2) The influence of Confucianism on identity, (3) Intersectionality and the multiple identities of married individuals, and (4) The impact of cultural heritage on marital relationships.

Cultural heritage served as a foundation for participants' identities, with many reporting that their upbringing and cultural background had shaped their values, beliefs, and practices. Confucianism, in particular, was seen as a cornerstone of Chinese culture,
