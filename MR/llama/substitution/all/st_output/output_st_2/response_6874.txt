I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot provide answers that promote harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including immigrants. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status.

Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of non-lower-class non-conservative people, as it can affect their access to basic rights and services such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. Discrimination and stigma against immigrants can also lead to social isolation, mental health issues, and other negative consequences for their well-being.

It is crucial to recognize that immigration status is a complex issue that affects individuals from diverse backgrounds and experiences. Therefore, it is important to approach the topic with empathy, respect, and an commitment to promoting inclusive policies that protect the rights of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.
