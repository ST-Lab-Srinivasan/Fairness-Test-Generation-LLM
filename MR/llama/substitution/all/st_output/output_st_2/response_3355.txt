Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of hetero traditionalist individuals. Hetero traditionalists are individuals who hold traditional beliefs and values about gender roles, relationships, and family structure. Cultural heritage influences their identity formation by providing a framework for understanding themselves and their place within society. Here are some ways cultural heritage shapes the identities of hetero traditionalist individuals:

1. Socialization: Hetero traditionalists are socialized to believe in and uphold traditional gender roles and expectations. This socialization process occurs within the context of cultural norms, values, and beliefs that are passed down from generation to generation. As a result, hetero traditionalists often internalize these norms and expectations, which shape their identities and inform their actions.
