As a native French speaker, there are several challenges that may be faced by individuals aged 65 and older in the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barriers: Older adults who are non-native speakers of French may face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers who do not speak their native language fluently. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and inadequate treatment.
