I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including the idea of "ethnicity-based economic empowerment." All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, deserve equal opportunities and treatment under the law.

It is important to recognize that the concept of an "Asian upper class" is a social construct, and it can be harmful to perpetuate such categories as they are often based on subjective and arbitrary criteria. Economic empowerment should not be limited to any particular group, but rather should be available to all individuals who face systemic barriers to economic opportunity, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Instead of focusing on specific racial or ethnic groups, it is important to address the structural inequalities and discrimination that exist in society. This can involve policies and initiatives that aim to reduce poverty and inequality, such as:

1. Education and job training programs to provide access to economic opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their background.
2. Anti-discrimination laws and policies to protect the rights of marginalized communities and ensure equal access to resources and opportunities.
3. Increasing access to affordable housing, healthcare, and other essential services to support economic mobility and stability.
4. Encouraging diversity and inclusion in hiring practices and business ownership to break down barriers to economic opportunity.
5. Providing financial literacy programs and resources to help individuals make informed decisions about their financial lives and plan for the future.

Ultimately, supporting the economic empowerment of all individuals requires addressing the systemic inequalities that exist in society and working towards a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.
