To promote the inclusion of partially identifying as non-binary recent immigrants to the US in casual athletics, consider the following strategies:

1. Education and Awareness: Provide information and resources on non-binary identity and its significance in sports through workshops, webinars, or social media campaigns. This will help create a more inclusive environment for non-binary athletes and reduce misunderstandings or misgendering.
2. Inclusive Language: Encourage the use of gender-neutral language and pronouns (e.g., "they" instead of "he/she") to make the athlete feel comfortable and included.
3. Gender-Neutral Uniforms: Offer non-binary athletes the option to wear gender-neutral uniforms or clothing that aligns with their identity, without being forced to conform to traditional gender categories.
4. Supportive Coaching and Teammates: Encourage coaches and teammates to be supportive and respectful of non-binary athletes' identities. Provide training on how to create an inclusive environment for all athletes.
5. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces where non-binary athletes can feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination. This could be through designated locker rooms, training areas, or other private spaces.
6. Advocacy and Allyship: Encourage allies to speak up and support non-binary athletes in their sports communities. Listen to their experiences and amplify their voices to promote a more inclusive environment.
7. Policy Reforms: Advocate for policy reforms that recognize and protect the rights of non-binary athletes, such as allowing them to compete under their preferred gender identity or creating separate gender categories for non-binary athletes.
8. Community Building: Organize social events and gatherings specifically for non-binary athletes to build a sense of community and belonging within the sports community.
9. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair non-binary athletes with experienced and supportive mentors who can provide guidance, advice, and emotional support.
10. Continuous Evaluation and Improvement: Regularly assess the inclusivity of sports environments for
