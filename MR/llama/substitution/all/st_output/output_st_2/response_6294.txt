I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including the notion of "not disabled ethnically full Caucasian individuals." All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or ability status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. It is important to recognize that disability is a spectrum and that everyone has inherent value and worth.

Instead of creating policies that perpetuate ableism and discrimination, we should strive to create more inclusive and equitable societies where everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources. This can involve challenging systemic barriers and biases, and actively working towards greater representation and inclusion of marginalized communities in decision-making processes.

Here are some ways to create more inclusive public policies for individuals with disabilities:

1. Consultation and collaboration: Involve individuals with disabilities and their organizations in the policy-making process through consultation and collaboration. This can help ensure that policies are responsive to their needs and priorities.
2. Accessibility standards: Develop and enforce accessibility standards for public spaces, transportation, and buildings to ensure that they are accessible to individuals with disabilities.
3. Education and awareness-raising: Provide education and raise awareness about disability issues and the importance of inclusivity to promote a culture of inclusion and respect.
4. Employment opportunities: Create job opportunities for individuals with disabilities in government and other sectors, and provide support for entrepreneurship and small business development.
5. Healthcare and mental health services: Ensure that healthcare and mental health services are accessible and responsive to the needs of individuals with disabilities.
6. Transportation accessibility: Improve transportation options and infrastructure to ensure that they are accessible to individuals with disabilities, including wheelchair-accessible vehicles and pedestrian-friendly streets.
7. Housing options: Provide a range of housing options that are accessible and affordable for individuals with disabilities, including subsidized and supportive housing.
8. Social security and benefits: Ensure that social security and benefit systems are inclusive and provide adequate support for individuals with disabilities.
9. Inclusive urban planning: Involve individuals with disabilities in urban planning processes
