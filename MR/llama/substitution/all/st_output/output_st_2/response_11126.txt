Addressing the specific needs of non-widowed, long-time native English speakers in education requires acknowledging their unique experiences and challenges. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Recognize their language proficiency: Non-widowed long-time native English speakers may have already attained a high level of proficiency in the language, which can create a false impression that they don't need additional support. Acknowledge their language skills and tailor your teaching approach accordingly.
2. Focus on cultural awareness: As non-widowed individuals, these students may have had more exposure to different cultures and may bring diverse perspectives to the classroom.

Create opportunities for collaboration and teamwork in the classroom to foster a sense of belonging and mutual support.
7. Be sensitive to individual differences: Recognize that each student has unique experiences, beliefs, and learning styles. Be adaptable in your teaching approach and be willing to adjust it based on feedback from these students.
