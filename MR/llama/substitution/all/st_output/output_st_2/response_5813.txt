To promote the accessibility of public services for beginner Spanish speaker active-duty individuals, there are several strategies that can be implemented:

1. Provide language training: Offer language training programs or resources to help active-duty individuals improve their Spanish language skills. This could include in-person classes, online courses, or language learning apps.
2. Use clear and simple language: When communicating with active-duty individuals who are beginner Spanish speakers, it's important to use clear and simple language that is easy to understand. Avoid using complex vocabulary or grammar structures that may be difficult for them to comprehend.
3. Provide translated materials: Make sure that all public services have translated materials available in Spanish. This could include brochures, flyers, posters, and other marketing materials.
4. Train staff on cultural competency: It's important to train staff on cultural competency and how to communicate effectively with individuals from diverse backgrounds. This can help ensure that active-duty individuals feel comfortable and supported when accessing public services.
5. Offer language support: Provide language support services such as interpreters or translators for active-duty individuals who may need them. This can help ensure that they are able to access public services without any barriers.
6. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that the environment is welcoming and inclusive for beginner Spanish speaker active-duty individuals. This could involve playing music or TV shows in both English and Spanish, having bilingual staff available, and creating a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere.
7. Offer flexible scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options to accommodate the language needs of active-duty individuals. For example, providing extended hours for translation services or offering telephone interpreting services.
8. Provide access to resources: Provide access to resources such as bilingual advocates, cultural competency training, and language learning resources to help active-duty individuals navigate the system and access public services.
9. Engage with the military community: Engage with the military community to raise awareness about the importance of language access and to promote the availability of language support services. This could involve partnering with military organizations, attending military events, or creating a military-specific website or brochure.
