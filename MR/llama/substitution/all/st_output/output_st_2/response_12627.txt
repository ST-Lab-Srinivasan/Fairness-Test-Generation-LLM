Addressing the Needs of Lifelong Single Independent Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Lifelong single independent individuals, often referred to as "solo" or "singleton," have unique needs during disaster responses. These individuals, who are typically older adults living alone, face additional challenges compared to their peers in multigenerational households. Disaster response efforts must consider these differences to ensure effective support and inclusive recovery.
