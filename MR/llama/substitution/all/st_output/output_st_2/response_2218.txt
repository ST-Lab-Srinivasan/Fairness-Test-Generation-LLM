Upper-class Mexicans, also known as the "hermandad" or "elite," face a range of challenges within the legal system. These challenges are rooted in the country's history of inequality and discrimination, which have created a system that often favors those with power and resources over those without. Some of the specific challenges faced by upper-class Mexicans in the legal system include:

1. Impunity: Upper-class Mexicans often enjoy a level of impunity when it comes to breaking the law. They may be less likely to be held accountable for their actions, as they have the means to influence or bribe authorities to avoid prosecution.
