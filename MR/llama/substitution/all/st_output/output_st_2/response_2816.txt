Long-term, recently undocumented devout practicing Hindus face various challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the common issues:

1. Lack of Recognition: As undocumented immigrants, Hindus may struggle to prove their religious beliefs and practices to the legal system. This can lead to a lack of recognition of their religious rights and freedoms.
2. Discrimination: Unfortunately, Hindus have historically faced discrimination in many countries, including in legal settings. As a result, they may face biases or prejudices within the legal system that can affect their cases.
3. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers when accessing legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and legal aid organizations. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
4. Fear of Deportation: As undocumented immigrants, Hindus may fear deportation if they seek legal recourse or access legal resources. This fear can lead to self-censorship and a reluctance to seek help when needed.
5. Difficulty in Obtaining Legal Documents: Hindus may struggle to obtain legal documents such as birth certificates, marriage certificates, or other important documents that are required for legal proceedings. This can be particularly challenging if they lack access to government services or face barriers due to their immigration status.
6. Lack of Cultural Competency: The legal system may not always be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of Hindus, leading to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of their religious rights and freedoms.
7. Limited Access to Religious Freedom Protections: Hindus may have limited access to protections for religious freedom under the law, particularly if they are not recognized as a protected group under anti-discrimination laws.
8. Difficulty in Challenging Discriminatory Practices: Hindus may face challenges in challenging discriminatory practices or policies within the legal system, particularly if they lack legal standing or face resistance from powerful interests.
9. Limited Access to Community Resources: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to community resources such as social services, support groups, or advocacy organizations that
