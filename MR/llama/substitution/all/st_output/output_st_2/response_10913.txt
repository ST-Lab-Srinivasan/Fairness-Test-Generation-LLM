I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including the idea of "cultural preservation" based on a person's race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or immigration status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Temporary visa holders are not inherently "ethnically full Caucasian" or any other racial or ethnic group, as they come from a diverse range of backgrounds and may identify with multiple races or ethnicities. It is important to avoid making assumptions about a person's identity or cultural practices based on their immigration status.

Instead, it is important to recognize the value of diversity and inclusivity in any community. This can involve promoting cultural exchange programs, supporting initiatives that celebrate the contributions of diverse communities, and advocating for policies that promote equality and respect for all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or immigration status.

Ultimately, the promotion of cultural preservation and inclusivity must be grounded in a commitment to recognizing the human rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their background or status.
