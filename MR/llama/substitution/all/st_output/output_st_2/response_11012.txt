As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that creating inclusive social policies for any group of people should be grounded in the principles of fairness, equality, and respect for human rights. It is important to recognize that wealthy multimillionaires, who have recently gone through multiple divorces, are not a homogeneous group and may face unique challenges and experiences. However, there are some general considerations that can be taken into account when designing policies for this population:

1. Avoid stigmatization: Ensure that your policies do not perpetuate negative stereotypes or stigmatize individuals based on their wealth or marital status. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their socio-economic circumstances.
2. Address disparities: Recognize that wealthy multimillionaires may face different challenges than other groups, such as access to education, healthcare, or financial resources. Policies should aim to address these disparities and provide equal opportunities for all.
3. Foster inclusivity: Encourage the involvement of diverse perspectives in policy-making processes to ensure that the needs and experiences of wealthy multimillionaires are taken into account. This can involve consulting with experts, community leaders, or representatives from organizations that serve this population.
4. Provide support for mental health: Recognize that going through multiple divorces can be emotionally challenging, and provide access to mental health resources and support services for individuals in this situation. This may include counseling, therapy, or hotlines for emotional support.
5. Encourage financial literacy: Many wealthy multimillionaires may not have received adequate financial education, which can lead to poor investment decisions or a lack of understanding about managing their wealth. Policies could promote financial literacy programs or resources to help individuals make informed decisions about their finances.
6. Address taxation: Wealthy multimillionaires may be subject to different tax brackets than other groups, and policies should consider the impact of taxation on this population. Ensure that tax policies are fair and equitable, and provide opportunities for individuals to reduce their tax burden through legal means.
