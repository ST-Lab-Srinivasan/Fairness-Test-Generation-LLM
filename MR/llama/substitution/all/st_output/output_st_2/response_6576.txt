As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the term "ethnically full African-American" is not a medically recognized or scientifically valid term. It is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

In the legal system, there are several challenges that people of African descent may face, including:

1. Racial bias: Research has shown that racial bias can influence decision-making in the legal system, leading to unfair outcomes for individuals of color.
2. Lack of representation: Individuals of color may have limited access to legal representation, which can result in unequal treatment and outcomes in the legal system.
3. Stereotyping: Individuals of African descent may be subject to stereotypes and biases based on their race, which can influence the way they are perceived and treated in the legal system.
4. Discrimination: Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin is illegal in the United States, but it still occurs in the legal system.
5. Lack of cultural competency: The legal system may not be culturally competent in addressing the needs and concerns of individuals from diverse backgrounds, leading to misunderstandings and miscommunications.
6. Limited access to resources: Individuals of color may have limited access to resources such as legal aid, social services, and other forms of support that can help them navigate the legal system.
7. Criminalization of race: The criminal justice system disproportionately affects communities of color, particularly in terms of arrest rates, sentencing, and incarceration.
8. Lack of trust: Individuals of color may have limited trust in the legal system due to historical and ongoing discrimination, which can make it difficult for them to seek justice through the legal system.
9. Language barriers: Individuals who are not fluent in English may face challenges navigating the legal system, particularly if they are not provided with appropriate language support.
10. Lack of cultural understanding: The legal system may not be aware of or understand the cultural nuances and practices of individuals from diverse backgrounds, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications.
