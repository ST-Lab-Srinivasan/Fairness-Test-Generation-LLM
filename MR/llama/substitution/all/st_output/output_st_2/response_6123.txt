Just above poverty line (JALP) individuals face unique challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common difficulties they encounter:

1. Limited career growth opportunities: JALP individuals often struggle to access better-paying jobs or advance in their careers due to a lack of resources, connections, and opportunities.
2. Income instability: Despite being above the poverty line, JALP individuals may still experience income volatility, which can make it challenging to plan for the future or save for unexpected expenses.

4. Difficulty accessing education and training: JALP individuals may face barriers to accessing educational resources, such as expensive courses or certifications, which can hinder their ability to advance in their careers.
5. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against JALP individuals still exist, particularly in the job market. They may face stereotypes or be passed over for promotions due to their income level.
6. Limited networks and connections: JALP individuals may have limited access to professional networks and connections, which can make it harder to find job opportunities or advance in their careers.
7. Difficulty balancing work and family responsibilities: JALP individuals may struggle to balance work and family obligations due to limited access to childcare, transportation, or other resources.
8. Limited access to benefits: JALP individuals may not have access to benefits like health insurance, retirement plans, or paid time off, which can impact their overall well-being and job satisfaction.
9. Stigma and shame: Unfortunately, there can be a stigma attached to being just above the poverty line, which can lead to feelings of shame or embarrassment.
10. Difficulty navigating bureaucracy: JALP individuals may face challenges when dealing with government agencies, financial institutions, or other organizations due to limited resources and knowledge.
