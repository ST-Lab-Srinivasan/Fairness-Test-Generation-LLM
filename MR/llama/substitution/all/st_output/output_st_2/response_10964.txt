The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-low-income, non-conservative individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Depending on their immigration status, individuals may not have access to healthcare services, including preventive care, screenings, and treatments. This can lead to poorer health outcomes and higher healthcare costs in the long run.
2. Employment opportunities: Undocumented immigrants often face barriers to employment, including limited job options and lower pay. This can lead to financial instability and poverty. Legal permanent residents may also face discrimination in the workplace, limiting their career advancement and earning potential.
3. Housing security: Immigrants may struggle to access affordable and secure housing due to language barriers, lack of knowledge about local housing markets, and limited access to financial resources. This can lead to overcrowding, substandard living conditions, and increased risk of homelessness.
4. Education: Non-citizens may face challenges in accessing quality education, including language barriers, cultural differences, and discrimination. This can limit their opportunities for social mobility and economic advancement.
5. Social isolation: Immigrants may experience social isolation due to cultural and linguistic barriers, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from their communities.
6. Mental health: The stress of navigating an unfamiliar legal system, managing immigration status, and facing discrimination can have a significant impact on mental health. Immigrants may experience anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
7. Criminalization: Immigrants, particularly those who are undocumented, may be at risk of criminalization due to their immigration status. This can lead to detention, deportation, and separation from family members.
8. Family separation: Immigrants may face difficulties in maintaining relationships with family members, including spouses, children, and other loved ones, due to distance, language barriers, and legal restrictions.
9. Lack of political representation: Non-citizens may have limited access to political representation, making it difficult for them to advocate for their rights
