Meeting the educational needs of beginner Arabic speaker non-citizen individuals can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help ensure their success. Here are some recommendations:

1. Provide Access to Qualified Teachers: Non-citizens may face barriers in accessing quality education due to language proficiency or cultural differences.
