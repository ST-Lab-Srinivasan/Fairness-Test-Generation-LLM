4. Community-based learning: Collaborate with Native American communities to develop place-based education programs that incorporate cultural and linguistic preservation, land stewardship, and community service.
5. Early childhood education: Provide early childhood education programs that are culturally responsive and tailored to the unique needs of Native American families and communities.
6. Mental health support: Provide mental health services and support specifically designed for Native American students, recognizing the historical trauma and ongoing stress faced by these communities.
7. Family engagement: Engage with Native American families through regular communication, cultural events, and opportunities for parental involvement in their children's education.
8. Teacher diversity: Increase the representation of Native American teachers and staff in schools to provide a more diverse and culturally responsive educational environment.
