Creating more inclusive social policies for average earners who are not in a relationship requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by this group. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the existence of average earners who are not in a relationship: The first step is to recognize that average earners who are not in a relationship exist and face specific challenges. Policymakers should gather data and research on this group to better understand their needs and develop tailored policies.
2. Address the gender pay gap: The gender pay gap persists, even among average earners. Policymakers can implement measures to address this issue, such as promoting equal pay for equal work, providing family-friendly benefits, and encouraging flexible work arrangements.
3. Improve access to affordable housing: Many average earners struggle to afford decent housing. Policymakers can introduce policies that increase the supply of affordable housing, provide rental subsidies, or invest in programs that help low-income households purchase homes.
4. Enhance retirement savings options: Average earners may not have access to employer-sponsored retirement plans or the financial resources to save for retirement. Policymakers can introduce policies that encourage retirement savings, such as automatic enrollment in retirement plans or matching contributions from employers.
5. Provide family-friendly benefits: Average earners who are not in a relationship may face additional expenses related to childcare, healthcare, and other family responsibilities. Policymakers can introduce policies that provide support for these expenses, such as paid parental leave, affordable childcare options, or subsidies for health insurance premiums.
6. Address mental health concerns: Average earners who are not in a relationship may experience higher rates of stress and mental health issues due to social isolation or economic pressures. Policymakers can invest in mental health services, promote workplace wellness programs, or provide resources for telehealth services.
7. Promote financial literacy: Many average earners may lack the knowledge and skills necessary to manage their finances effectively. Policymakers can introduce policies that promote financial literacy education, provide access to free or low-cost financial planning
