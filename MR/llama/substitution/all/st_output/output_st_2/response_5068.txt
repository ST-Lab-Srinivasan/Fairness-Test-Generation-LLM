Advocating for the rights of recent immigrants and long-time veterans in the United States can be a challenging task, as these groups may face different forms of discrimination and marginalization. However, there are several examples of successful advocacy campaigns that have worked to address the specific issues faced by each group. Here are some examples:

1. Advocating for the rights of recent immigrants:
* The National Immigration Law Center (NILC) has been a leading voice in advocating for the rights of immigrants, including those who are recent arrivals to the US. NILC works to advance immigrant rights through policy changes, legal action, and community organizing.
* The National Immigration Project (NIP) is another organization that has worked to advance the rights of immigrants, particularly those who are detained or facing deportation. NIP provides legal support and advocacy for immigrant detainees and works to challenge unjust immigration policies.
2. Advocating for the rights of long-time veterans:
* The Disabled American Veterans (DAV) is a nonprofit organization that has been advocating for the rights of disabled veterans since 1920. DAV provides free legal assistance to veterans and works to secure disability compensation and other benefits for those who have been injured or disabled while serving in the military.
* The Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) is another organization that has worked to advocate for the rights of veterans, particularly those who have served in combat zones. The VFW provides support services to veterans and their families, including mental health counseling, job placement, and education assistance.
* The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) is a nonprofit organization that has worked to advocate for the rights of veterans who have served in recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. IAVA works to improve healthcare access, mental health support, and education benefits for veterans.
3. Advocacy campaigns:
* The "Welcoming America" initiative is a national campaign that works to promote the inclusion of immigrants in US communities. Welcoming America provides resources and support to local organizations working to create more inclusive environments for immigrants
