The impact of a parent's military status on their children can be significant and far-reaching. Separated children, in particular, may face unique challenges as a result of their parents' military service. Some common impacts of military status on the lives of separated child individuals include:

1. Emotional Instability: Children of deployed parents may experience anxiety, depression, and emotional instability due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of their parent's deployment. They may feel guilty for feeling happy or secure while their parent is away, leading to feelings of guilt and shame.
2. Lack of Routine and Stability: Military families often experience frequent moves and changes in routine, which can be disruptive to children's lives. This lack of stability can lead to difficulties with adjusting to new environments, making friends, and maintaining a sense of security.
3. Social Isolation: Children of deployed parents may feel isolated from their peers and community due to the frequent moves and separation from friends and social networks. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection.
4. Difficulty with Separation: Separated children may struggle with the concept of separation, as they may not fully understand why their parent is away or when they will return. They may also feel a sense of abandonment or rejection, leading to emotional distress and behavioral problems.
5. Increased Risk of Trauma: Children who experience traumatic events, such as combat or natural disasters, are at an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental health issues.
6. Difficulty with Trust and Attachment: Children whose parents are deployed may struggle with trust and attachment issues due to the absence of their primary caregiver. They may have difficulty forming close relationships or feeling secure in their environment.
7. Academic and Social Challenges: Military children may experience academic and social challenges due to the frequent moves and changes in school and social environments. They may struggle to keep up with schoolwork, make new friends, or adapt to new social situations.
8. Increased Risk of Mental Health Issues: Children of deployed parents are at an increased risk of developing mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse
