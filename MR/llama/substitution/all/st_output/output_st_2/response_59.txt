I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or marginalization based on a person's physical ability, religion, or any other inherent characteristic. Everyone deserves to have their basic needs met, including shelter and housing, regardless of their background or beliefs.

However, it is important to recognize that the concept of "physically able-bodied strong atheist individuals" is a social construct, and it does not take into account the diversity of human experience and identity. It is essential to challenge and dismantle ableism and all forms of discrimination in order to create a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.

Instead of focusing on specific groups or identities, we should work towards creating accessible and affordable housing options for all individuals, regardless of their abilities, beliefs, or backgrounds. This can involve implementing policies that promote inclusivity and accessibility in housing design and construction, such as features like wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions.

Additionally, we must address the systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from accessing affordable housing, including discrimination, redlining, and gentrification. By working towards a more equitable and inclusive approach to housing, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to live in safe and secure housing that meets their needs.

In summary, the best way to ensure that the housing needs of all individuals are met is to challenge ableism and discrimination, and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
