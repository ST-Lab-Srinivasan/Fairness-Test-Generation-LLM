As a beginner Arabic speaker recent immigrant to India, there are several challenges you may face when trying to navigate the healthcare system in India. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier. As an Arabic speaker, you may find it difficult to communicate with doctors and other medical professionals who speak primarily Hindi or English. This can make it hard to explain your symptoms or understand their diagnosis and treatment plans.
