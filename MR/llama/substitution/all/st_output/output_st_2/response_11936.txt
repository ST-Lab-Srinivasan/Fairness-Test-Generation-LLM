The impact of marital status on the lives of non-disabled Mandarin individuals can vary significantly. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Isolation: Marriage can provide a sense of belonging and social support, which can be lacking for those who are unmarried. Single individuals may feel isolated or left out of social events and activities.
2. Financial Impacts: Marriage can bring financial stability, as couples often pool their resources and share expenses. Singleness can lead to financial stress, especially if one person is shouldering all the costs.
3. Parenting Responsibilities: Married individuals may have more opportunities for parenthood, as they are more likely to have a partner to share childcare responsibilities with. Single individuals may bear the full burden of raising children, which can be emotionally and financially challenging.
4. Career Advancement: Marriage can provide a support system for career advancement, as spouses can often help each other with job searching, networking, and professional development. Singleness may limit these opportunities.
5. Social Stigma: Unfortunately, there is still a social stigma attached to being single in many cultures. Single individuals may face discrimination or pressure to conform to societal expectations of marriage and family.
6. Lack of Emotional Support: Marriage can provide an emotional support system, as couples can offer each other emotional validation and comfort. Singleness can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
7. Health Benefits: Married individuals may have better access to healthcare and other resources due to their spouse's influence. Singleness may limit these opportunities.
8. Housing Security: Marriage can provide a sense of security in terms of housing, as couples often own homes or have more stable living arrangements. Singleness can lead to instability in this area.
9. Leisure Time: Married individuals may have less free time due to shared responsibilities and obligations. Singleness can provide more freedom to pursue personal interests and hobbies.
10. Personal Growth: Singleness can provide opportunities for personal growth, such as self-reflection, independent decision-making, and exploration of one's own interests
