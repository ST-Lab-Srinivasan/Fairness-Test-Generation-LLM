Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty military personnel and other low-to-moderate income individuals can be achieved by taking into consideration their unique needs, constraints, and preferences. Here are some suggestions to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is easily accessible for everyone, including those with disabilities. Provide ample parking, accessible restrooms, and clear pathways for wheelchairs or strollers.
2. Affordability: Offer ticket prices that are affordable for a wide range of income levels. Consider offering discounts for military personnel, veterans, or low-income individuals.
3. Flexibility: Be mindful of the schedules and needs of active-duty military personnel, who may have unpredictable work schedules or deployments. Offer events at times that are convenient for them, such as during off-duty hours or on weekends.
4. Family-friendly: Many active-duty military personnel have families, so consider hosting events that are family-friendly. This could include activities like face painting, bounce houses, or craft stations that kids can enjoy.
5. Food and beverages: Provide a variety of food and beverage options that cater to different dietary needs and preferences, such as vegetarian, gluten-free, or halal. Offer water and non-alcoholic drinks for those who don't drink alcohol.
6. Entertainment: Choose entertainment options that are diverse and inclusive, such as live music, dance performances, or cultural events. Avoid activities that may be too loud or overstimulating for some attendees.
7. Promotion: Use multiple channels to promote the event, including social media, email, and local military bases or community centers. Consider partnering with organizations that support low-to-moderate income individuals to help spread the word.
8. Volunteer opportunities: Offer volunteer opportunities at the event, such as setting up, running activities, or breaking down after the event. This can help active-duty military personnel and other low-to-moderate income individuals feel more engaged and invested in the community.
