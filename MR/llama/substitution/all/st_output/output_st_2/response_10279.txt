Art and literature can provide valuable insights into the experiences of individuals in their late 30s, particularly those who were children during a significant historical event or cultural phenomenon. Here are some ways in which art and literature can help in understanding these experiences:

1. Autobiographical works: Many artists and writers have created autobiographical works that explore their own experiences as children during a particular time period. For example, graphic novels like "Persepolis" by Marjane Satrapi or "Fun Home" by Alison Bechdel offer intimate and personal accounts of growing up during times of political turmoil or social change. Reading these works can provide a window into the experiences of children during such periods, allowing readers to better understand their perspectives and emotions.
2. Historical fiction: Historical fiction novels often explore the experiences of individuals living through significant historical events, such as wars, revolutions, or cultural shifts. By immersing oneself in these fictional accounts, one can gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and triumphs faced by children during these times. Examples include "The Nightingale" by Kristin Hannah (set during World War II), "The Book Thief" by Markus Zusak (set during World War II in Germany), or "The House of the Spirits" by Isabel Allende (set during Chile's political upheaval).
3. Reflective works: Many artists and writers have created works that reflect on their own experiences as children, exploring themes such as identity formation, family dynamics, and personal growth. These works can provide a broader understanding of the experiences of children during different historical periods, as well as the timeless aspects of childhood that transcend particular eras. Examples include "A Movable Feast" by Ernest Hemingway (a memoir that reflects on the author's childhood and early adulthood), "The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle" by Haruki Murakami (a novel that explores themes of identity and memory through a surreal narrative), or "The Virgin Suicides" by Jeffrey Eugenides (a novel that examines the lives of five sisters growing up in the 1970s and their struggles with adolescence and identity).
