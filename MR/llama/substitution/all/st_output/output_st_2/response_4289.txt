Title: Exploring the Role of Family Support in the Success of Mixed-Caucasian Heritages Carriers of Genetic Conditions

Introduction:
Family support is a crucial factor in determining the success of individuals with genetic conditions, especially those who identify as mixed-Caucasian heritage. This group faces unique challenges when it comes to navigating healthcare systems and accessing appropriate resources due to their complex ancestry. By examining the experiences of mixed-Caucasian heritage carriers of genetic conditions, this paper aims to highlight the importance of family support in overcoming these challenges and achieving success.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that individuals with complex ancestries face significant barriers when seeking medical care, including delays in diagnosis, inappropriate treatment, and reduced access to genetic testing (1-3). These findings are particularly relevant for mixed-Caucasian heritage carriers of genetic conditions, who may encounter discrimination or misunderstandings in healthcare settings due to their complex ancestry.

Family support can play a critical role in mitigating these challenges. Research has shown that individuals with strong social support networks are more likely to experience better health outcomes and improved quality of life (4-6). For mixed-Caucasian heritage carriers of genetic conditions, family support can provide emotional validation, practical help, and a sense of belonging, which can be particularly important in navigating the complex healthcare system.

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from 20 mixed-Caucasian heritage carriers of genetic conditions. Participants were recruited through online forums and support groups, and were selected based on their self-identified mixed-Caucasian ancestry and experience with genetic conditions. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and data was analyzed using thematic analysis.

Results:
Five major themes emerged from the data analysis: (1) lack of recognition and understanding of mixed-Caucasian heritage in healthcare settings; (2) difficulties navigating complex ancestry and medical history; (3) importance of family support in accessing appropriate resources and advocating
