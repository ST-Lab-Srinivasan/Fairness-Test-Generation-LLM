Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are ethnically full Hispanic requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs reflect the diversity of the Hispanic community by including perspectives from different countries, cultures, and backgrounds. This can be done by incorporating music, art, literature, and other cultural elements from various Latin American countries and communities.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes certain ethnic groups. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all Hispanic individuals, regardless of their ethnic background.
3. Provide subtitles or translation: Offer subtitles or translations for cultural programs to make them more accessible to beginner Spanish speakers who may not be fluent in the language yet. This can help bridge the gap between the program and its intended audience.
4. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and inclusive environment where beginner Spanish speakers feel comfortable participating and engaging with the cultural programs. Encourage open communication, respectful dialogue, and active listening to foster a sense of belonging.
5. Foster intercultural understanding: Organize workshops or events that promote intercultural understanding and exchange between beginner Spanish speakers and other members of the Hispanic community. This can help build bridges between different ethnic groups and create a more inclusive cultural environment.
6. Celebrate diverse traditions: Acknowledge and celebrate the diverse cultural traditions within the Hispanic community, such as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, and Dominican cultures, among others. This can help beginner Spanish speakers feel seen and valued, and encourage them to embrace their own cultural identity.
7. Provide opportunities for leadership: Offer beginner Spanish speakers the opportunity to take on leadership roles within the cultural programs, such as leading a cultural dance or performing in a play. This can help build confidence and sense of belonging among participants.
8. Collaborate with community organizations: Partner with local organizations that serve the Hispanic community to co-create and promote cultural programs.
