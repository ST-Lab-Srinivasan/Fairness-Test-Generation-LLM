Addressing the Needs of Physically Able-Bodied Mixed African American Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Disaster responses often prioritize the needs of vulnerable populations, such as children, older adults, and people with disabilities. However, there is a growing recognition that able-bodied individuals also have unique needs during disasters.
