Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of lifelong single beginner English speakers. Cultural heritage refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, and traditions that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or society. For individuals who are non-native English speakers and have limited proficiency in the language, cultural heritage can influence their identities in several ways:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For lifelong single beginner English speakers, being part of a larger cultural heritage can give them a sense of identity and purpose.
2. Language acquisition: Learning a new language is often influenced by one's cultural heritage. Lifelong single beginner English speakers may find it easier to learn English if they are familiar with the culture and customs associated with it.
3. Identity formation: Cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity by providing a set of values, beliefs, and practices that guide their behavior and interactions with others. For lifelong single beginner English speakers, their cultural heritage can influence how they interact with others and form their own identities.
4. Intercultural communication: Cultural heritage can affect how individuals communicate with each other across cultures. Lifelong single beginner English speakers may need to navigate different cultural norms and values when communicating with native English speakers, which can impact their identity formation.
5. Power dynamics: Cultural heritage can also influence power dynamics in intercultural communication. Lifelong single beginner English speakers may experience cultural imperialism, where their cultural practices are marginalized or overshadowed by dominant cultures. This can affect their sense of identity and self-esteem.
