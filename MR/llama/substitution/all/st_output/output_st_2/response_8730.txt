Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals in various stages, including those who are not yet pregnant or recently single. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care due to fear of deportation or lack of insurance coverage. This can lead to delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby's health.
