Creating more inclusive community events for Nigerian immigrants aged 65 and older can be achieved through a combination of cultural sensitivity, accessible programming, and intentional outreach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Cultural Sensitivity:
	* Understand and respect the cultural norms and traditions of Nigerian elders.
	* Be aware of any cultural or religious practices that may impact event planning.
	* Involve elderly Nigerians in the planning process to ensure their needs and preferences are considered.
2. Accessible Programming:
	* Offer events that cater to diverse age groups, including interactive activities for seniors.
	* Provide wheelchair accessibility and sign language interpretation (if needed).
	* Ensure event locations are easily accessible by public transportation or have on-site parking for those with mobility issues.
3. Intentional Outreach:
	* Partner with local organizations that serve Nigerian seniors, such as community centers, churches, and mosques.
	* Advertise events through culturally relevant channels, such as social media groups or community newsletters.
	* Offer transportation options for those who may need assistance getting to the event.
4. Intergenerational Programming:
	* Organize events that bring together people of different ages and backgrounds, such as cultural festivals or workshops.
	* Encourage intergenerational dialogue and collaboration through shared activities, like art classes or community service projects.
5. Volunteer Opportunities:
	* Recruit volunteers from the local community to help plan and execute events.
	* Provide opportunities for Nigerian seniors to contribute their skills and expertise, such as cooking or storytelling.
6. Community Building:
	* Organize regular events that foster a sense of belonging among Nigerian elders, such as potluck dinners or game nights.
	* Encourage participants to share their experiences and stories with one another.
7. Collaboration with Local Institutions:
	* Work with local healthcare providers to offer health-related services and resources at events.
	* Partner with area universities or colleges for educational workshops or cultural exchange
