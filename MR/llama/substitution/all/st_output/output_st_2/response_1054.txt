Non-upper-class cisgender people, or those who identify with the gender they were assigned at birth and do not identify as transgender or non-binary, may face a range of challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the common ones:

1. Lack of cultural competence: Non-upper-class cisgender people may encounter healthcare providers who lack understanding of their cultural background and experiences, leading to inadequate care or misunderstandings.
2. Limited access to care: Non-upper-class cisgender people may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited availability of providers in their area.
3. Inadequate diagnosis and treatment: Cisgender patients may receive inadequate diagnosis and treatment for conditions related to their gender identity, such as hormone imbalances or mental health issues.
4. Discrimination and stigma: Non-upper-class cisgender people may experience discrimination and stigma within the healthcare system due to their gender identity or expression.
5. Inadequate support for gender-affirming care: Non-upper-class cisgender people may not have access to gender-affirming care, such as hormone therapy or gender confirmation surgeries, due to financial constraints or limited availability of providers.
6. Limited understanding of intersectionality: Healthcare providers may lack an understanding of how a patient's multiple identities (such as race, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender) interact and impact their health, leading to inadequate care.
7. Inadequate communication: Non-upper-class cisgender people may encounter language barriers or unfamiliar terminology when communicating with healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnosis.
8. Difficulty navigating the system: Cisgender patients may find it challenging to navigate the complex healthcare system, particularly if they are uninsured or underinsured.
9. Limited control over treatment decisions: Non-upper-class cisgender people may feel that they have limited control over their treatment decisions due to factors such as lack of access to care, financial constraints, or limited understanding of their condition.
