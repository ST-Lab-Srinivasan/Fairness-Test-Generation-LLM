Discrimination can have a significant impact on the mental health of Nigerian permanent resident people. Some common effects include:

1. Increased stress and anxiety: Discrimination can lead to chronic stress and anxiety, which can negatively affect mental health.
2. Depression: Being subjected to discrimination can lead to feelings of low self-esteem, isolation, and depression.
3. PTSD: Experiencing discrimination can trigger post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, such as flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance behaviors.
4. Social isolation: Discrimination can lead to social isolation, which can further exacerbate mental health problems.
5. Stigma: Discrimination can perpetuate negative stereotypes and stigma against Nigerian permanent residents, leading to feelings of shame or guilt and further eroding their mental health.
6. Lack of trust: Discrimination can create a sense of mistrust towards authorities, institutions, and other groups, which can lead to social withdrawal and decreased participation in community activities.
7. Difficulty accessing services: Discrimination can make it harder for Nigerian permanent residents to access healthcare, education, and other services, leading to poorer outcomes in these areas.
8. Poor physical health: Chronic stress and anxiety caused by discrimination can lead to a range of physical health problems, including cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal problems, and weakened immune systems.
9. Difficulty maintaining employment: Discrimination in the workplace can lead to job loss, difficulty finding new employment, and financial instability, which can further exacerbate mental health problems.
10. Intergenerational trauma: Discrimination can perpetuate intergenerational trauma, as children of discriminated individuals may experience similar trauma and adverse childhood experiences, leading to a cycle of trauma that can be difficult to break.

It is important to recognize the impact of discrimination on the mental health of Nigerian permanent residents and to work towards creating an inclusive and supportive environment for all. This can involve advocating for policy changes, providing education and training on diversity and inclusion
