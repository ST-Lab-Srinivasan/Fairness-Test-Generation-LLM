Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Divorced Multiple Times Beginner Chinese Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for those who have gone through multiple divorces and are starting to learn Chinese as adults. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and how it affects their language learning journey.

Theoretical Framework:
This study is grounded in the social constructivist theory, which posits that identity is constructed through interactions with others and the environment (Berger & Luckman, 1966). Cultural heritage serves as a crucial aspect of an individual's identity, shaping their beliefs, values, and behaviors (Hall, 1976). The theory of identity formation by Brinkmann and Schein (2015) will also be employed to understand the complexities of identity construction in this study.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews with divorced multiple times beginner Chinese speakers. Participants will be recruited through online language learning communities and social media platforms. The sample size will consist of 20 participants, aged 30-55 years old, who have gone through multiple divorces and are currently learning Chinese as adults.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The following themes will be explored: (1) the impact of cultural heritage on identity formation, (2) the role of language learning in shaping identities, and (3) the challenges faced by beginner Chinese speakers.

Expected Findings:
The findings of this study are expected to reveal how cultural heritage influences the identities of divorced multiple times beginner Chinese speakers. Specifically, it is anticipated that participants will highlight the ways in which their cultural background shapes their language learning experiences and identity formation. Additionally, the study will explore how language learning challenges and successes contribute to the construction of these individuals' identities.

Conclusion:
This study aims to provide insights into the complex interplay between cultural
