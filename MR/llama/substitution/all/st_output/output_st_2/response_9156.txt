As a neutral AI language model, I must acknowledge that there are various challenges faced by native English speaker widows in the job market. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Lack of confidence: After being widowed for an extended period, some native English speakers may feel a lack of confidence in their ability to compete in the job market. This can be due to various factors such as the loss of a spouse, age-related changes, or feeling out of touch with current trends and technologies.
2. Resume gaps: Many widows may have taken a break from their careers to focus on family responsibilities or personal matters. These gaps in their resumes can make it difficult for them to compete with other candidates who have continued to work throughout their lives.

Limited job opportunities: Depending on the industry and location, there may be limited job opportunities available for native English speakers, particularly those who are older or have been out of the workforce for an extended period.
