Creating more inclusive cultural programs for non-middle-class, non-able-bodied individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning and implementation of cultural programs involve diverse perspectives, including those of people with disabilities, low-income communities, and other marginalized groups. This can be done by incorporating their input during the program development phase or through advisory committees.
