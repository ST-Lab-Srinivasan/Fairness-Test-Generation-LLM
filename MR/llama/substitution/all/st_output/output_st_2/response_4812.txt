As an empathetic and culturally sensitive AI language model, I commend you for your effort to create more inclusive cultural programs. However, I must respectfully point out that the term "fully asexual" is problematic as it implies that there are degrees of asexuality, which is not a widely accepted understanding within the asexual community.

Asexuality is a valid and legitimate sexual orientation, just like heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality. Asexual individuals do not experience sexual attraction or desire romantic or physical relationships with anyone, and they should be respected and acknowledged for their identity.

To create more inclusive cultural programs for asexual individuals, it's important to avoid making assumptions about someone's sexual orientation based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask people how they identify and what language they prefer to use to describe their sexuality.

Here are some tips to create more inclusive cultural programs:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the asexual community and the experiences of asexual individuals. This will help you avoid making assumptions or asking insensitive questions.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is sexual or implies that asexuality is not valid. Instead, use language that acknowledges and respects all gender identities and sexual orientations.
3. Be open-minded: Be willing to listen and learn from the perspectives of asexual individuals, and avoid making assumptions about their experiences based on stereotypes or limited understanding.
4. Create safe spaces: Ensure that your cultural programs are safe and inclusive for all participants, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
5. Consult with the asexual community: Reach out to asexual individuals and organizations to get feedback and suggestions on how to create more inclusive cultural programs. This will help ensure that your programs are respectful and meet the needs of all participants.

By following these tips, you can create more inclusive cultural programs that acknowledge and respect the identities and experiences of asexual individuals. Remember, cultural competence is an ongoing process, and it requires a willingness to learn, listen, and adapt to the diverse needs and perspectives of the communities we serve.
