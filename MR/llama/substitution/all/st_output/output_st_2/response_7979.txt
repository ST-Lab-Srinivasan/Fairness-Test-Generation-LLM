I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on how to create discriminatory or exclusive social policies towards any individual or group, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. All individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, should be treated with dignity and respect and should have equal access to opportunities and resources.

It is important to recognize that discrimination and exclusion can have serious consequences for the mental health and well-being of individuals and can perpetuate systemic inequalities. Therefore, it is crucial to create social policies that promote inclusivity, diversity, and equality for all.

Instead of focusing on ways to exclude certain groups, we should strive to create a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity. This can involve educating ourselves and others about the experiences and challenges faced by marginalized communities, advocating for policies and practices that promote equality and inclusion, and working to dismantle systems of oppression and discrimination.

Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Let's work together to create a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
