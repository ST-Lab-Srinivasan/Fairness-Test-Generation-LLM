Creating more inclusive social policies for deep poverty individuals who are long-time married and happy in their relationships requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and promotes equal opportunities for all. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies:

1. Address systemic barriers: Many policies and practices perpetuate inequality and discrimination, particularly against marginalized communities.
