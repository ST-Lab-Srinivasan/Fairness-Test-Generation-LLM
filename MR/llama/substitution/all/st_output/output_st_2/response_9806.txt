Temporary visa holders are entitled to the same basic rights and freedoms as all other individuals in a given country, including the right to access financial services and support. However, it is important to recognize that temporary visa holders may face unique challenges when it comes to accessing financial resources, due to their immigration status and potential lack of access to financial institutions.

To ensure that the financial needs of temporary visa holders are met, it is important to address these challenges through policies and practices that promote inclusivity and equity.
