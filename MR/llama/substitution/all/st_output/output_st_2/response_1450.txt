I cannot provide advice on how to promote the exclusion or marginalization of any particular group, including devout Muslim ethnically full Hispanic individuals. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, religion, or background, should be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on promoting inclusivity and diversity in athletics, which can involve the following strategies:

1. Providing access and opportunities: Ensure that all individuals have equal access to athletic programs and facilities, regardless of their background or beliefs. This may involve outreach and recruitment efforts to engage underrepresented communities.
2. Creating an inclusive environment: Foster a culture of respect and inclusion within athletic teams and organizations, where all individuals feel valued and supported. This can involve education and training on diversity, equity, and inclusion for coaches, players, and other stakeholders.
3. Addressing discrimination and bias: Take action to address any instances of discrimination or bias that may arise within athletic programs, and work to create a zero-tolerance policy towards such behavior.
4. Celebrating diversity: Highlight the diverse backgrounds and experiences of athletes, coaches, and other stakeholders within the athletics community, and promote an inclusive atmosphere that values and appreciates differences.
5. Building partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support underrepresented communities, such as Muslim advocacy groups, to create mutually beneficial partnerships and promote inclusivity in athletics.

By implementing these strategies, you can help promote the inclusion of devout Muslim ethnically full Hispanic individuals in casual athletics and create a more diverse and inclusive environment for everyone involved.
