Supporting beginner Spanish speaker physically disabled communities can be a challenging task, but there are several effective strategies that can help. Here are some approaches you can consider:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that your learning space is accessible to people with disabilities. This may involve providing wheelchair access, audio descriptions, or sign language interpretation, among other accommodations.
2. Inclusive Language: Use inclusive language and avoid terms that perpetuate ableism or discrimination against people with disabilities. Encourage learners to do the same in their interactions with you and fellow students.
