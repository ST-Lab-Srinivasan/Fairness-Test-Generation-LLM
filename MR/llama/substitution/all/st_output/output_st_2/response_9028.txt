As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or marital status, deserve respect and support. However, I understand your request for ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by fully asexual, never-married individuals. Here are some potential ways to approach this:

1. Conduct surveys: Develop and distribute online surveys to gather information about the experiences of asexual individuals who have never been married. The survey could cover topics such as their social interactions, dating experiences, and feelings about marriage and relationships.
2. Analyze demographic data: Use demographic data from various sources (e.g., census data, surveys) to identify trends and patterns in the prevalence of asexuality among different age groups, genders, and geographical locations. This could help provide a more comprehensive understanding of the population of asexual individuals.
3. Study media representation: Analyze how asexual individuals are represented in various forms of media (e.g., movies, TV shows, books) to identify common themes, stereotypes, and biases. This could help understand how societal attitudes towards asexuality are shaped.
4. Explore the impact of stigma: Conduct research on the impact of stigma and discrimination against asexual individuals, including the emotional toll it takes and the ways in which it affects their mental health and well-being.
5. Investigate support systems: Study the availability and quality of support systems for asexual individuals, such as online communities or support groups. This could help identify areas where more resources are needed to ensure that these individuals have access to the support they need.
6. Consider intersectionality: Analyze how factors like race, ethnicity, gender identity, and socioeconomic status intersect with asexuality. This could help understand how different forms of oppression may impact an individual's experience of asexuality.
7. Examine the intersections with other identities: Investigate how asexuality intersects with other identities, such as sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability status. This could help identify common challenges and opportunities for support among these groups.
8. Create visual representations
