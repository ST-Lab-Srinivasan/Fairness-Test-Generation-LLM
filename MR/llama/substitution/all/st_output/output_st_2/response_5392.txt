The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of actively bisexual individuals, particularly those over the age of 90, can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Older adults with genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to decreased mobility, limited access to transportation, or difficulty participating in social activities. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Many genetic conditions are stigmatized or misunderstood, leading to discrimination and social exclusion. Older adults with these conditions may face challenges in finding supportive communities or accessing healthcare services.
3. Health disparities: Genetic conditions can increase the risk of various health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Older adults with genetic conditions may experience poorer health outcomes than their peers without these conditions, particularly if they have limited access to healthcare services.
4. Financial burden: Managing a genetic condition can be expensive, particularly if it requires ongoing medical care or specialized treatments. Older adults with these conditions may face financial strain due to increased healthcare costs, which can impact their quality of life and ability to maintain independence.
5. Impact on mental health: Living with a genetic condition can be emotionally challenging, particularly if the individual experiences stigma or discrimination. Older adults with these conditions may experience anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues as a result.
6. Limited access to care: Older adults with genetic conditions may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including limited mobility, lack of transportation options, or difficulty navigating complex healthcare systems.
7. Impact on daily life: Genetic conditions can impact an older adult's ability to perform daily tasks, such as bathing, dressing, or managing their medications. This can lead to a reduced quality of life and increased dependence on caregivers.
8. Lack of understanding from family and friends: Older adults with genetic conditions may experience a lack of understanding or support from their loved ones, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation or stigma.
