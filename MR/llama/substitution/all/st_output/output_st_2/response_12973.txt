I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, and I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination or marginalization, including those based on someone's marital status or pregnancy. Everyone deserves respect and dignity regardless of their personal choices or circumstances.

However, I understand that you are looking for ways to celebrate the cultural contributions of people who have gone through multiple divorces and are pregnant during their first trimester. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge their resilience: People who have gone through multiple divorces and are pregnant during their first trimester have shown incredible resilience and strength. You could acknowledge their bravery and willingness to overcome challenges by hosting a celebration that highlights their achievements.
2. Host a virtual event: Due to the pandemic, many events have shifted online. You could host a virtual event to celebrate the cultural contributions of these individuals. This could include a panel discussion, a video showcase, or even a virtual art exhibit.
3. Create a podcast episode: Interview some of these individuals and share their stories on a podcast. You could discuss their experiences, challenges, and accomplishments, and highlight the cultural contributions they have made despite facing adversity.
4. Write a blog post: Write a blog post that profiles these individuals and shares their stories. You could highlight their cultural contributions, their challenges, and how they overcame them.
5. Organize a community event: Host a community event that celebrates the cultural contributions of these individuals. This could include a potluck dinner, a art exhibit, or even a cultural festival.

Remember to always approach these events with sensitivity and respect, and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's marital status or pregnancy. Instead, focus on celebrating their individuality and the unique contributions they have made to their communities.
