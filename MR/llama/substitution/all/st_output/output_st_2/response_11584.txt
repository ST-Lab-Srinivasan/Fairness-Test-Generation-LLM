I must clarify that the term "deeply lower-class" is not a recognized social or economic categorization. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity, deserve equal opportunities and resources for economic empowerment. Here are some ways to support the economic empowerment of marginalized Asian communities:

1. Education and skills development: Provide access to education and skills training programs that can help individuals acquire marketable skills and improve their job prospects.
2. Microfinance and entrepreneurship: Offer microloans or other forms of financial support to help individuals start or grow their own businesses, which can provide a sustainable source of income.
3. Job training and placement: Provide job training and placement services to help individuals gain the skills and experience needed to compete in the job market.
4. Community development: Invest in community development initiatives that create jobs, improve infrastructure, and provide other resources that can help stimulate economic growth in marginalized communities.
5. Advocacy and policy change: Advocate for policies that address systemic barriers to economic empowerment faced by marginalized Asian communities, such as discrimination, lack of access to education and job opportunities, and limited political representation.
6. Mentorship and networking: Provide mentorship and networking opportunities to connect individuals from marginalized communities with successful professionals and entrepreneurs who can offer guidance, support, and access to resources.
7. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent marginalized Asian communities from achieving economic empowerment, such as discrimination, inequality, and lack of access to resources.
8. Building community wealth: Invest in initiatives that build community wealth, such as cooperative businesses, community land trusts, and other forms of collective ownership.
9. Supporting social enterprise: Invest in social enterprises that address specific needs within marginalized communities, such as healthcare, education, and job training.
10. Advocating for policy change: Advocate for policies that promote economic empowerment for marginalized Asian communities, such as affordable housing, access to healthcare, and anti-discrimination laws.
