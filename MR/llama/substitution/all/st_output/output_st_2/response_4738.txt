3. Support inclusive policies: Advocate for policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion within your community or workplace. This can involve pushing for representation in leadership positions, creating safe spaces for marginalized groups, or advocating for policies that address systemic barriers to success.
4. Amplify their voices: Use your platform to amplify the voices of mixed Asian heritage individuals and promote their work, art, or activism. This can involve sharing their content on social media, introducing them to your network, or featuring them in events or exhibitions.
