Promoting the cultural integration of non-disabled Native American recent immigrants to the US requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Cultural orientation programs: Provide cultural orientation programs that introduce these individuals to mainstream US culture, values, and customs. These programs can help them navigate the social and cultural landscape of their new environment.

4. Mentorship programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair them with experienced individuals from their own culture or other immigrant groups. These mentors can provide guidance on navigating US society, finding employment, and building social connections.
5. Access to healthcare: Ensure they have access to quality healthcare services that cater to their specific needs. This can include culturally sensitive healthcare providers and language-appropriate medical materials.
6. Education and job training: Provide educational and job training programs tailored to their needs and goals. This can help them acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the US job market.
7. Legal support: Offer legal support services that address their unique immigration status and provide guidance on accessing benefits, entitlements, and social services.
8. Housing assistance: Provide housing assistance programs that cater to their specific needs, such as culturally appropriate housing options or language-appropriate information on housing resources.
9. Cultural festivals and events: Organize cultural festivals and events that showcase their heritage and traditions, while also promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
10. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policies that address the unique challenges faced by non-disabled Native American recent immigrants to the US. This can include changes to immigration laws, healthcare policies, and social services that better cater to their needs.
