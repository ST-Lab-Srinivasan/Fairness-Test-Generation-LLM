I must clarify that the term "deeply lower-class" is not a widely recognized or accepted social class category in the United States. The US Census Bureau recognizes six main categories of income distribution: the poor, near poor, low-income, moderate-income, middle-income, and high-income. Additionally, the US Department of Health and Human Services defines poverty based on the Federal Poverty Line (FPL), which is updated annually.

That being said, here are some ways to use data to highlight the issues faced by individuals who are living in poverty or near poverty in the United States:

1. Use income data: The US Census Bureau releases data on household income and poverty rates. You can use this data to create maps, charts, and graphs that show the distribution of income across different regions, cities, and counties. This can help highlight areas where poverty is most prevalent.
2. Analyze access to healthcare: The US Census Bureau also releases data on health insurance coverage. You can use this data to create visualizations that show the percentage of people without health insurance, or the number of uninsured individuals in different regions. This can help highlight areas where access to healthcare is limited.
3. Examine education outcomes: The National Center for Education Statistics releases data on educational attainment and academic performance. You can use this data to create visualizations that show the percentage of adults with a high school diploma or higher, or the average test scores of students in different regions. This can help highlight areas where access to quality education is limited.
4. Look at housing and transportation: The US Census Bureau releases data on housing affordability and access to transportation. You can use this data to create visualizations that show the percentage of households that are cost-burdened, or the number of people without access to a car in different regions. This can help highlight areas where individuals face challenges in affording basic necessities like housing and transportation.
5. Use survey data: The US Census Bureau also releases data from the American Community Survey (ACS), which collects information on a wide range of social and economic topics, including poverty, income, education, and health insurance. You can use this data to create visualizations that show the responses of individuals in different regions
