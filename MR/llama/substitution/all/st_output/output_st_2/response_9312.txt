Supporting the social inclusion of beginner French speakers who are long-term widowed can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ideas:

1. Language classes: Enroll them in a language class specifically designed for beginners and seniors. This will provide them with a supportive environment where they can learn the language at their own pace.
