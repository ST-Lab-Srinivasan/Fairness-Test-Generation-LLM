Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping the Identities of Mixed-Caucasian Heritages Individuals with Ultra-Conservative Beliefs

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those from mixed Caucasian backgrounds who subscribe to ultra-conservative beliefs. This study aims to investigate how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and their adherence to conservative values.

Theories:
This study will draw on the theories of identity formation, cultural identity, and socialization to understand how cultural heritage shapes the identities of mixed-Caucasian individuals with ultra-conservative beliefs.
