Individuals who experience deep poverty, often defined as living on less than 50% of the local median income, face significant challenges in the job market. These challenges can include:

1. Limited access to education and job training: Deeply impoverished individuals may not have access to quality education or job training programs, which can limit their ability to compete for jobs that require specialized skills or knowledge.
2. Health issues: Poverty can lead to poor health outcomes, including malnutrition, lack of access to healthcare, and increased susceptibility to illnesses. These health issues can make it difficult for individuals to work or maintain a job.
3. Limited transportation options: In rural areas or communities with limited public transportation, deeply impoverished individuals may not have reliable access to transportation, making it difficult to get to job interviews or work.
4. Discrimination: Deep poverty can lead to discrimination in the job market, as some employers may be hesitant to hire individuals who are perceived as being from a lower socio-economic background.
5. Limited network and connections: Deeply impoverished individuals may not have access to professional networks or connections that can help them find job opportunities or advance in their careers.
6. Lack of job opportunities: In some areas, there may be a lack of job opportunities, particularly for low-skilled workers. This can make it difficult for deeply impoverished individuals to find and maintain employment.
7. Childcare responsibilities: Many deeply impoverished individuals are single parents or have other caregiving responsibilities, which can limit their ability to work outside the home or maintain a job that requires a regular work schedule.
8. Limited access to technology: In some areas, deeply impoverished individuals may not have access to computers, internet, or other technologies that are necessary for certain types of employment.
9. Lack of job stability: Deep poverty can lead to a lack of job stability, as workers may be more likely to experience layoffs or job insecurity due to economic conditions beyond their control.
10. Stigma and shame: Experiencing deep poverty can lead to feelings of stigma and shame, which can make it difficult for individuals to seek out help or support
