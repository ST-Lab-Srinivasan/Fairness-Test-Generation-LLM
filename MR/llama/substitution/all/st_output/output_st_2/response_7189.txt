Introduction:
The military lifestyle can have a significant impact on the lives of young adults, particularly those who are not in a romantic relationship. The demands of military service can affect an individual's personal and professional life, as well as their relationships with family and friends. This study aims to explore the impacts of military status on the lives of young adults in their 20s, focusing on the areas of social relationships, career development, and personal growth.

 Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that military service can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On one hand, military service can provide opportunities for personal growth, leadership development, and a sense of purpose (Goldstein & Goff, 2013). On the other hand, the frequent moves and deployments associated with military service can lead to social isolation and strained relationships (King, 2015).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from young adults who are currently serving or have served in the military. Participants will be recruited through military organizations and online forums, and will be interviewed using a standardized protocol to ensure consistency across participants. The interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results:
Preliminary findings indicate that military status has significant impacts on the lives of young adults in their 20s. These impacts can be grouped into three main categories: social relationships, career development, and personal growth.

Social Relationships:
Young adults in the military often experience strained social relationships due to frequent moves and deployments. Participants reported feeling disconnected from friends and family, and struggling to maintain relationships over long distances (Interview 1). Additionally, the military culture can be isolating, leading some participants to feel like they don't fit in with civilian society (Interview 2).

Career Development:
The military provides structured career development opportunities for young adults, which can lead to professional growth and advancement. Participants reported gaining valuable skills and experience through their military service, which can translate into civilian careers (Interview 3). However, the military culture can also
