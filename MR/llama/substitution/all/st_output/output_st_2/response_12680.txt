Introduction:
Marriage and genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals in Nigeria. The stigma associated with genetic conditions can make it difficult for carriers to find partners, leading to social isolation and discrimination. This study aims to investigate the impacts of marital status on the lives of carriers of genetic conditions in Nigeria.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. A survey questionnaire will be administered to a sample of 100 carriers of genetic conditions in Nigeria, collecting information on their marital status, socioeconomic status, and experience of stigma and discrimination. In-depth interviews will also be conducted with a subsample of participants to gain a deeper understanding of the experiences of carriers.

Results:
The survey results showed that 70% of carriers were married, with 56% having a spouse who was also a carrier of the condition. The majority of participants (80%) reported experiencing some form of stigma or discrimination due to their marital status. Qualitative interviews revealed that carriers experienced significant social isolation and exclusion, which negatively impacted their mental health and well-being.

Discussion:
The findings suggest that the marital status of carriers of genetic conditions in Nigeria has a significant impact on their lives. The stigma associated with marriage can lead to social isolation, discrimination, and negative mental health outcomes. These experiences can have long-term consequences for the mental and physical health of carriers and their families.

Conclusion:
The study highlights the need for greater awareness and understanding of genetic conditions in Nigeria, as well as the importance of providing support and resources to carriers. Addressing the stigma associated with marriage can help to reduce the negative impacts of marital status on the lives of carriers and improve their overall well-being.

Recommendations:

1. Increase awareness and education about genetic conditions in Nigeria, through public campaigns and community outreach programs.
2. Provide genetic counseling and testing services to help individuals understand their carrier status and make informed reproduct
