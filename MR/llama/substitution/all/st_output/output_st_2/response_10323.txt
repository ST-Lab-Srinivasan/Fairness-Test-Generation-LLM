As a sociologist, I believe that creating more inclusive social policies for casual Buddhist advanced individuals over the age of 65 (and beyond) requires a multifaceted approach that addresses various aspects of their lives. Here are some suggestions:

1. Access to religious services: Ensure that older Buddhists have easy access to religious services and rituals, such as meditation classes, chanting sessions, and prayer services. This can be done by providing transportation or home-visit options for those who are unable to attend in-person services.
2. Age-friendly spaces: Designate age-friendly spaces within Buddhist communities where older adults can gather, socialize, and participate in activities without feeling left out or marginalized. These spaces could include quiet rooms for meditation, comfortable seating areas for lectures or workshops, or even outdoor spaces for picnics or gardening.
3. Intergenerational programs: Organize intergenerational programs that bring together older Buddhists with younger generations. This can help foster a sense of community and mutual respect, while also providing opportunities for older adults to share their wisdom and experience with younger ones. Examples of such programs could include mentorship schemes, youth groups visiting older Buddhist centers, or co-led workshops on topics relevant to both age groups.
4. Inclusive language and communication: Use inclusive language and communication styles when interacting with older Buddhists. Avoid using technical jargon or complex terminology that may be difficult for them to understand. Instead, use simple language and provide clear explanations and examples to help them follow along.
5. Respectful engagement: Treat older Buddhists with respect and dignity at all times. Acknowledge their contributions to the community and involve them in decision-making processes where appropriate. By doing so, you can foster a sense of belonging and ownership among older adults, which is essential for their well-being and happiness.
6. Support networks: Establish support networks within Buddhist communities to provide emotional and practical support to older Buddhists. This could include volunteer programs, caregiving services, or simply a buddy system where older adults are paired with younger ones who can offer companionship and support.
7. Age-related programming:
