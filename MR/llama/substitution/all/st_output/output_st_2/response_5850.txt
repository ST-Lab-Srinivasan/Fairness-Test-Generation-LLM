This can be done through a combination of group and one-on-one classes, as well as adaptive learning software.
2. Interactive Content: Incorporate interactive content, such as videos, games, quizzes, and role-plays, to keep learners engaged and motivated. This can help beginners build their confidence in speaking and listening, while also reinforcing grammar and vocabulary concepts.
