In 1924, protecting the legal rights of non-liberal nominal Christians was a complex issue due to the tension between religious freedom and the state's role in regulating religion. Here are some possible ways that could have been addressed:

1. Separation of Church and State: One approach would be to advocate for a strict separation of church and state, where the government refrains from interfering with religious practices and beliefs, and religious institutions are free from state control. This would protect the legal rights of non-liberal nominal Christians by ensuring that they are not subjected to state coercion or discrimination based on their religious beliefs.
2. Religious Freedom Laws: Another approach would be to advocate for strong religious freedom laws that protect the rights of all individuals, regardless of their religious affiliation. This could include laws that prohibit discrimination against individuals based on their religious beliefs and practices, as well as provisions that ensure the free exercise of religion without fear of persecution or penalty.
3. Educating the Public: Educating the public about the legal rights of non-liberal nominal Christians could help to reduce prejudice and discrimination against them. This could involve raising awareness about the importance of religious freedom, as well as promoting understanding and respect for different religious beliefs and practices.
4. Supporting Non-Liberal Nominal Christians: Providing legal and social support to non-liberal nominal Christians could help to protect their rights and promote their welfare. This could involve advocating for their rights in court, providing legal aid and representation, and promoting social inclusion and acceptance of their beliefs and practices.
5. Encouraging Dialogue: Encouraging dialogue and mutual understanding between non-liberal nominal Christians and other religious groups could help to reduce tensions and promote cooperation. This could involve facilitating interfaith dialogues, promoting education and cultural exchange programs, and encouraging individuals to learn about and respect each other's beliefs and practices.
6. Challenging Discriminatory Laws: Non-liberal nominal Christians may face discrimination and persecution in some countries or regions, particularly if they are a minority religious group
