Volunteerism plays a significant role in supporting advanced age groups, particularly those over 90 years old or over 85, who may be considered "extreme ultra-liberal" communities. Here are some ways volunteerism can support these populations:

1. Social connection: Many older adults experience social isolation, which can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Volunteering provides opportunities for social interaction, helping to combat loneliness and improve overall well-being.
2. Physical activity: As people age, their physical abilities may decline, reducing their capacity for physical activity. Volunteering can provide a way for older adults to stay active, engaged, and connected with their communities.
3. Purpose and meaning: Older adults may experience a loss of purpose or meaning in their lives, particularly if they have retired from work or are dealing with declining health. Volunteering can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment by helping others and contributing to society.
4. Learning and personal growth: Volunteering can provide opportunities for older adults to learn new skills, expand their knowledge, and challenge themselves in new ways. This can help maintain cognitive function and overall mental health.
5. Community engagement: Volunteering can foster a sense of community and belonging among older adults, which is essential for emotional well-being. It can also provide opportunities to connect with younger generations and learn from their perspectives.
6. Healthcare access: Many older adults face barriers to accessing healthcare services due to mobility issues, financial constraints, or lack of transportation. Volunteering can help address these challenges by providing transportation, accompaniment, or other forms of support.
7. Advocacy and activism: Older adults may be more likely to advocate for social justice and environmental causes, particularly if they have a history of activism. Volunteering can provide opportunities to engage in advocacy and activism, raising awareness and making a positive impact on their communities.
8. Intergenerational connections: Volunteering can facilitate connections between older adults and younger generations, promoting mutual understanding and respect. This can help break down age-related stereotypes and build more inclusive communities
