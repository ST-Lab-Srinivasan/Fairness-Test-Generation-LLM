Creating more inclusive cultural programs for upper upper middle-income non-disabled individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that organizations can consider:

1. Inclusive programming: Design cultural programs that are accessible and inclusive to all, regardless of their abilities. This can include providing American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or braille materials for patrons who are deaf or hard of hearing, blind or have low vision.
2. Diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural programs feature diverse perspectives and representations. This can be achieved by showcasing works created by artists from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities.
3. Accessible venues: Make sure that the venues are accessible to all patrons, including those with mobility impairments. Ensure that the spaces are wheelchair-friendly and have accessible seating areas.
4. Flexible ticket options: Offer flexible ticket options, such as pay-what-you-can or free admission, to make cultural programs more accessible to a broader audience.
5. Community engagement: Engage with the community by hosting workshops, lectures, and other events that promote diversity and inclusion. This can help create a more inclusive environment and attract a more diverse audience.
6. Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that serve diverse communities to reach a broader audience. For example, partnering with organizations that support people with disabilities or from different cultural backgrounds can help increase attendance and participation.
7. Marketing and outreach: Utilize marketing strategies that target diverse audiences, such as social media campaigns, community newsletters, and flyers in multiple languages.
8. Audio descriptions and tactile tours: Provide audio descriptions of exhibits and tactile tours for patrons who are blind or have low vision. This can help them better experience and appreciate the cultural program.
9. Braille and large print materials: Offer Braille and large print materials for patrons who are visually impaired or have learning disabilities.
10. Inclusive hiring practices: Ensure that the organization's staff is diverse and inclusive, and that they receive training on accessible programming and customer service.
