The impact of military status on the lives of non-libertarian, non-wealthy individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Increased burden on public services: Military service can put a strain on local public services, such as healthcare and education, as military personnel may require additional support during their deployment or upon return.
2. Disrupted family dynamics: Deployment can lead to disruptions in family life, including the need to care for dependents and navigate logistical challenges related to relocation and separation.
3. Limited job opportunities: Military service can limit job opportunities for non-libertarian individuals, particularly if they are deployed or stationed overseas. This can make it difficult to advance in their careers or pursue civilian work.
4. Stigma and social isolation: Non-libertarian individuals may face stigma or social isolation due to their military status, particularly if they do not identify with the libertarian ideology.
5. Limited access to resources: Military personnel may have limited access to resources such as healthcare, education, and other benefits that are available to civilians.
6. Difficulty navigating bureaucracy: Non-libertarian individuals may face challenges navigating military bureaucracy and accessing the benefits and resources they are entitled to.

8. Lack of autonomy: Military personnel may feel limited in their autonomy and ability to make decisions about their own lives due to the strict hierarchical structure of the military.
9. Limited access to civilian culture: Non-libertarian individuals may have limited exposure to civilian culture and society, particularly if they are deployed overseas or stationed in remote areas.
10. Difficulty transitioning back to civilian life: Upon return from deployment, non-libertarian individuals may face challenges transitioning back to civilian life, including adjusting to a new routine and reintegrating with family and friends.
