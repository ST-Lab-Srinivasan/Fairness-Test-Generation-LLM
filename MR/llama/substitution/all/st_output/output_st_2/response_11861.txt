As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or immigration status, are entitled to equal protection under the law. The legal rights of immigrant natural-born US citizens, including those who identify as LGBTQ+, are protected by the US Constitution and various federal and state laws. Here are some ways to ensure that these rights are fully protected:

1. Adopt inclusive policies: Federal and state governments can adopt policies that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. This can include training for government employees, creating diverse hiring panels, and implementing anti-discrimination measures in the workplace.
2. Strengthen anti-discrimination laws: The US has a patchwork of anti-discrimination laws that protect individuals from discrimination based on race, gender, religion, and other characteristics. Immigrant natural-born citizens should be protected under these laws, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
3. Provide legal resources: Organizations that provide legal assistance to immigrant communities, such as the National Immigration Law Center and the Immigration Legal Resource Center, can help ensure that immigrant natural-born citizens have access to legal resources and support.
4. Support advocacy groups: Advocacy groups, such as the LGBTQ+ advocacy group GLAAD, can play a crucial role in promoting the rights of immigrant natural-born citizens who identify as LGBTQ+. These organizations can provide legal support, organize events, and raise awareness about the issues facing this community.
5. Educate the public: Raising awareness about the issues facing immigrant natural-born citizens who identify as LGBTQ+ can help to build public support for their rights. This can involve educating people about the challenges they face, such as discrimination and unequal access to healthcare and other services.
6. Monitor and report on discrimination: Organizations that monitor and report on discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals, such as the Human Rights Campaign, can help to identify areas where immigrant natural-born citizens are at risk of discrimination and work to address these issues.
