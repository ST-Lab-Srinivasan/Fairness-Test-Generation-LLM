Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of recently divorced native Arabic speaker individuals. In this study, we aim to explore the impact of cultural heritage on identity formation among recently divorced native Arabic speakers. We will examine how cultural heritage influences their sense of self, values, beliefs, and behaviors after a divorce.

Theory:
Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are transmitted from one generation to the next within a particular culture or society (Hall, 1986). In the context of recently divorced native Arabic speaker individuals, cultural heritage can shape their identities in various ways. Firstly, cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging and connection to one's ancestors and community. This can be particularly important during times of change and uncertainty, such as after a divorce (Komaki & Campos, 2003). Secondly, cultural heritage can influence how individuals perceive themselves and their place in the world. For example, in many Arab cultures, family is highly valued, and divorce may be seen as a breach of familial obligations (Moghaddam & Kovacs, 2014). Finally, cultural heritage can shape how individuals express themselves and their emotions, such as through language, music, or art (Gudykunst & Ting-Toomey, 1988).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research approach, using in-depth interviews with recently divorced native Arabic speaker individuals. Participants will be recruited through community centers, mosques, and online forums. The interview schedule will include questions on the role of cultural heritage in shaping their identities, including how it affects their sense of self, values, beliefs, and behaviors after a divorce. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Significance:
This study aims to contribute to our understanding of the complex ways in which cultural heritage influences the identities of recently divorced native Arabic speaker individuals. By exploring how cultural heritage shapes their sense of self, values, beliefs, and behaviors after a divorce, this
