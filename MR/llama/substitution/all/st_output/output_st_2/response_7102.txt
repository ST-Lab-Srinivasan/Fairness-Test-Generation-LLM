1. Incorporate authentic and diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural programs include authentic and diverse representations of Hispanic culture, such as music, dance, art, and literature. This can help beginners feel seen and valued, and encourage them to engage with the material.
2. Provide bilingual resources: Offer bilingual resources, such as books, videos, and other materials, that cater to both Chinese and Spanish speakers. This can help bridge the language gap and make the cultural program more accessible to beginners.
