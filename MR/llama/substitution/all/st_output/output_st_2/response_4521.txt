Promoting the financial stability of recent immigrants to the US requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various aspects of their financial well-being. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many recent immigrants face challenges in accessing traditional banking services due to language barriers, lack of documentation, or discrimination. Fintech companies and community banks can provide innovative solutions to reach this underserved population.
