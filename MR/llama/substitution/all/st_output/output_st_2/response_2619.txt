Title: The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Long-Term Widowed Beginner English Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly for long-term widows who are beginner English speakers. This study aims to explore how cultural heritage influences the identities of these individuals and how they navigate their grief and loss in a foreign language environment.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's sense of self and identity (Hall, 1980). For immigrants, cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and connection to their homeland, even in a foreign environment (Ward, 2014). However, for long-term widows who are beginner English speakers, the loss of their spouse can lead to a disruption in their cultural identity (Komita & Matsumoto, 2013).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using semi-structured interviews with long-term widowed beginner English speakers. Participants will be recruited through local support groups and online forums. The interviews will be conducted in a neutral language to minimize any potential bias in the responses.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from the interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The findings will be organized into themes related to cultural heritage and its impact on identity formation. The themes will include the participants' experiences of cultural displacement, loss of cultural practices, and the role of cultural heritage in shaping their identities.

Expected Findings:
The study is expected to reveal how cultural heritage influences the identities of long-term widowed beginner English speakers. The findings will show how the participants' cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging and connection to their homeland, even in a foreign environment. The study will also highlight the challenges faced by these individuals in navigating their grief and loss in a language that is not their native tongue.

Conclusion:
This study will contribute to our understanding of how cultural heritage shapes the identities of long-
