As a researcher, I can provide some insights on the challenges faced by not high-income professional mixed Asian heritage people in the healthcare system based on existing literature and studies. However, it is important to note that these challenges may vary depending on individual experiences and contexts. Here are some potential challenges that have been identified in the literature:

1. Cultural barriers: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may face cultural barriers in accessing healthcare services due to language or cultural differences between them and healthcare providers. For example, a study found that Vietnamese-American patients experienced delays in diagnosis and treatment due to communication barriers with their healthcare providers (1).
2. Lack of representation: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may feel underrepresented or unseen in the healthcare system, leading to feelings of isolation or marginalization. For example, a study found that Asian American patients experienced discrimination and bias in healthcare settings, which affected their perceptions of care (2).
3. Health disparities: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may experience health disparities due to factors such as access to healthy food options, safe living conditions, or lack of access to healthcare services. For example, a study found that Asian American adults were more likely to experience poor health outcomes compared to non-Hispanic white adults (3).
4. Stigma and discrimination: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may face stigma and discrimination based on their race or ethnicity, which can affect their mental health and well-being. For example, a study found that Asian American adolescents experienced higher levels of discrimination compared to non-Asian adolescents (4).
5. Identity conflicts: Mixed Asian heritage individuals may experience identity conflicts due to the complexity of their racial and ethnic identities. For example, a study found that Asian American individuals experienced identity conflict between their Asian and American identities (5).
6. Lack of cultural competency: Healthcare providers may lack cultural competence when working with mixed Asian heritage individuals, leading to misunderstandings or miscommunications. For example, a study found that healthcare providers had limited knowledge of the cultural practices and beliefs of Vietnamese Americans (6).
