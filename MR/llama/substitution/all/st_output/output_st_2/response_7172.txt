Creating more inclusive community programs for Nigerian recently divorced individuals, especially those who have gone through multiple divorces, requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions on how to create such programs:

1. Conduct needs assessment: Engage with the target population to understand their specific needs, challenges, and concerns. This will help you design programs that address their unique requirements.
2. Focus on mental health support: Divorce can have a significant impact on mental health, particularly for individuals who have gone through multiple divorces. Provide access to mental health professionals, counseling services, and support groups to help them cope with the emotional challenges of divorce.
3. Offer practical assistance: Many recently divorced individuals may struggle with basic needs such as food, shelter, and clothing. Develop programs that provide these essential necessities, as well as job training and placement services to help them become self-sufficient.
4. Promote social connections: Social isolation can be a significant challenge for recently divorced individuals, particularly those who have gone through multiple divorces. Organize community events, group outings, and social activities that encourage social interaction and connection.
5. Provide financial literacy training: Many recently divorced individuals may struggle with managing their finances due to lack of knowledge or experience. Offer financial literacy training, budgeting workshops, and access to financial planning resources to help them manage their finances effectively.
6. Develop age-appropriate activities: Recently divorced individuals may have different needs and interests at different stages of life. Develop programs that cater to these differences, such as youth programs for young adults, middle-aged programs for those in their 40s and 50s, and senior programs for older individuals.
7. Involve the community: Engage local businesses, organizations, and individuals in your community programs to create a sense of ownership and support. This can involve collaborating on event planning, providing resources or services, or simply offering moral support.
8. Address cultural considerations: Nigerian culture places a high value on family and community ties. Consider this when designing programs and ensure that they are sensitive to these cultural values. For example, include opportunities for social interaction and connection within the community.
