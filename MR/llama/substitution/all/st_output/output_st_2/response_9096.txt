Moderate-income temporary visa holders face several challenges when accessing the healthcare system in Australia. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited access to public hospitals: Temporary visa holders may not have access to public hospitals, as they are only entitled to receive care at a limited number of designated hospitals.
