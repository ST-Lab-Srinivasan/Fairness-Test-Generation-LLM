As a recently retired combat veteran who is also a Native American and a natural-born US citizen, there are several support systems that can be crucial to your well-being and success. Here are some of the most important ones:

1. Healthcare Services: As a veteran, you may be eligible for healthcare services through the Veterans Administration (VA). The VA provides access to medical care, mental health services, and prescription medication. Additionally, many tribes have their own healthcare systems that offer culturally sensitive care.
2. Mental Health Services: Combat veterans often experience stress, anxiety, and depression due to the trauma they experienced during their military service. It's essential to seek professional help from mental health professionals who understand the unique challenges faced by veterans. Many VA hospitals and clinics offer mental health services, including counseling and therapy.
3. Peer Support Groups: Connecting with other combat veterans who have gone through similar experiences can be incredibly helpful in navigating the challenges of readjustment to civilian life. Peer support groups provide a safe space for veterans to share their experiences, offer support, and build camaraderie.
4. Community Resources: Reaching out to local community resources such as non-profit organizations, veteran service organizations, and advocacy groups can provide valuable support and connections. These organizations often offer job training programs, education and employment services, and assistance with accessing healthcare and other benefits.
5. Family Support: As a combat veteran, you may face unique challenges in readjusting to civilian life, especially if you have a family. It's essential to have a strong support system within your family, including your spouse or partner, children, and extended family members. Encourage open communication and mutual support to help navigate the transition back to civilian life.
6. Traditional Healing: For Native American veterans, traditional healing practices can provide an additional layer of support. Many tribes have their own traditional healing programs that incorporate cultural and spiritual practices to promote mental, emotional, and physical well-being. These programs may include ceremonies, rituals, and other activities that foster healing and connection to one's culture and community.
