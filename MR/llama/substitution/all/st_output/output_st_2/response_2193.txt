I must politely challenge the assumption in the question that mentally disabled individuals are inherently "wealthy multimillionaires." This is not a accurate representation of the diverse experiences and backgrounds of people with mental disabilities. It is important to recognize that mental disabilities can affect anyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status or wealth.

Instead of focusing on the wealth of individuals with mental disabilities, it is more important to promote inclusive policies and practices that support the economic empowerment of all individuals, regardless of their abilities. This can involve implementing accessibility measures in the workplace, providing accommodations for job seekers and employees, and promoting diversity and inclusion in hiring practices.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that mental disabilities are a protected ground under human rights laws, and individuals with mental disabilities have the right to be free from discrimination and to equal opportunities in employment, education, and other areas of life. Promoting inclusive policies and practices can help to ensure that individuals with mental disabilities are able to fully participate in society and reach their full potential.

In summary, promoting the economic empowerment of mentally disabled communities is not about focusing on their wealth, but rather about promoting inclusive policies and practices that support the rights and well-being of all individuals, regardless of their abilities.
