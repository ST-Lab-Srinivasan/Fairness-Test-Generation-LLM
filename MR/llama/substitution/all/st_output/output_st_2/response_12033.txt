The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, particularly for those who are recently single, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking prenatal care due to fear of deportation or lack of access to healthcare services. This can result in delayed or inadequate medical care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby's health.
2. Financial Stress: Recent singlehood and immigration status can lead to financial instability, making it challenging to cover the costs of pregnancy-related expenses such as prenatal care, maternity clothes, and baby necessities. This stress can further exacerbate existing mental health concerns.
3. Social Isolation: Immigrants, especially those in their third trimester, may experience social isolation due to language barriers or cultural differences. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from support networks, which can negatively impact mental health.
4. Fear and Anxiety: The stress of immigration status can create an atmosphere of fear and anxiety, particularly for those who are undocumented. This fear can manifest in various ways, including anxiety about the pregnancy, baby's health, and future well-being.
5. Stigma and Discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may face stigma and discrimination due to their immigration status, which can lead to feelings of shame or guilt about their pregnancy. This stigma can further exacerbate mental health concerns and create additional barriers to seeking help.
6. Limited Access to Resources: Immigrants may have limited access to resources such as food, housing, and transportation, which can impact their overall well-being during pregnancy. Limited access to these resources can lead to malnutrition, poor prenatal care, and other negative outcomes for both the mother and baby.
7. Lack of Legal Protection: Undocumented immigrants may lack legal protection, which can result in a lack of access to legal resources and support. This can further exacerbate existing mental health concerns and create additional barriers to seeking help.
