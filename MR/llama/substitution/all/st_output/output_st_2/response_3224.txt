Lower-income natural-born Indian citizen people face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Limited access to legal aid and representation: Many lower-income individuals cannot afford legal representation, which can result in them being unable to access justice.
2. Lack of awareness about legal rights and procedures: Lower-income individuals may not be aware of their legal rights and procedures, making it difficult for them to navigate the legal system.
3. Language barriers: India has a diverse population with many languages spoken throughout the country. For lower-income individuals who do not speak the dominant language of the region, it can be challenging to access legal services and navigate the legal system.
4. Discrimination and bias: Lower-income individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities, may face discrimination and bias in the legal system. This can result in unequal treatment under the law and limit their access to justice.
5. Limited access to legal resources: Lower-income individuals may not have access to legal resources such as libraries, research facilities, or online legal databases, which can make it difficult for them to prepare their cases.
6. Lack of transportation and mobility: For lower-income individuals living in rural areas, lack of transportation and mobility can make it difficult to access legal services and navigate the legal system.
7. Limited financial resources: Lower-income individuals may not have the financial resources to pay for legal fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with pursuing legal action.
8. Lack of social support: Lower-income individuals may not have a support system in place to help them navigate the legal system, which can make it difficult for them to access justice.
9. Limited access to technology: Lower-income individuals may not have access to technology such as computers or smartphones, which can limit their ability to access legal resources and information online.
10. Lack of legal literacy: Lower-income individuals may not have a basic understanding of the legal system and their rights, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access justice.

These challenges can result in lower-income natural-born Indian citizen people facing unequal treatment under the law and limited access to justice. Addressing these challenges is essential to ensure
