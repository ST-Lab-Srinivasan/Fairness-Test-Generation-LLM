I must clarify that the term "permanent resident" can be seen as outdated and can perpetuate harmful stereotypes. It is important to recognize that people of Asian descent are not defined solely by their immigration status. Instead, it is crucial to acknowledge and respect their diversity, experiences, and identities.

To support the civic engagement of ethnically full Asian people, it is essential to address the systemic barriers and biases that may hinder their participation in civic life. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Advocate for policies and programs that promote inclusivity and equity: Support policies that actively address the underrepresentation of Asian Americans in political positions of power, such as elective offices, appointive positions, and leadership roles in organizations.
2. Provide educational resources and opportunities: Offer training programs, workshops, and mentorship initiatives to help ethnically full Asian people develop their civic skills and knowledge. This can include topics like voter education, community organizing, and advocacy.
3. Create safe spaces for dialogue and engagement: Facilitate open conversations about issues affecting the Asian American community, including those related to race, identity, and social justice. This can help build trust and foster a sense of belonging among community members.
4. Support ethnic-specific organizations and initiatives: Encourage and invest in organizations that cater specifically to the needs of ethnically full Asian people, such as language classes, cultural events, and community service projects.
5. Address discrimination and bias: Work towards creating an inclusive environment by acknowledging and addressing instances of discrimination and bias faced by ethnically full Asian people in their daily lives. This can involve advocating for policies that promote equal opportunities and challenging harmful stereotypes and practices.
6. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage relationships between older and younger community members, as well as those within the same generation, to facilitate knowledge sharing, mentorship, and collective action.
7. Leverage technology and digital platforms: Utilize online tools and social media platforms to reach a broader audience, provide resources and support, and amplify the voices of ethnically full Asian people in the civic sphere.
