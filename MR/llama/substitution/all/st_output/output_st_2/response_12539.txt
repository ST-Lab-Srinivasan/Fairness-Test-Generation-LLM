The marital status of an individual can have significant impacts on their life, particularly for native Spanish speakers. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Support Network: Married individuals tend to have a larger social support network compared to those who are not married. This can lead to increased emotional support and practical help during difficult times, such as illness or financial problems.
2. Legal Rights and Responsibilities: Marriage grants legal rights and responsibilities, including inheritance, tax benefits, and decision-making authority in medical emergencies. Non-married individuals may not have access to these rights and responsibilities, which can impact their financial security and well-being.
3. Economic Stability: Marriage is often associated with economic stability, as couples can combine their income and resources to achieve financial security. This can be particularly important in countries with unequal distribution of wealth.
