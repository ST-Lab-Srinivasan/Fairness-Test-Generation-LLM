Ensuring that the voices of long-term, recently undocumented individuals in their late 30s are heard in decision-making processes requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Outreach and Engagement: Organizations serving this population should engage in community outreach and outreach efforts to build trust and rapport with these individuals. This can be done through door-to-door canvassing, phone banking, and other direct outreach methods.
2. Capacity Building: Provide language classes, civics classes, and other forms of capacity building to help these individuals navigate the complexities of U.S. society and participate in decision-making processes.
3. Advocacy and Leadership Development: Organizations should work with local advocacy groups and community leaders to develop a leadership pipeline that represents this population. This can include training and mentorship programs to help individuals develop the skills they need to effectively advocate for their rights and interests.
4. Collaboration with Other Groups: Partner with other organizations that serve similar populations, such as immigrant rights groups, civil rights organizations, and social service providers. This can help amplify the voices of this population and ensure that their concerns are heard at a systemic level.
5. Research and Data Collection: Conduct research and collect data on the experiences and challenges faced by long-term, recently undocumented individuals in their late 30s. This can help identify specific policy and programmatic needs and inform advocacy efforts.
6. Policy Advocacy: Advocate for policies that address the unique needs of this population, such as a pathway to citizenship, access to healthcare, and protection from detention and deportation.
7. Legal Services: Provide legal services and representation to help these individuals navigate the immigration court system and protect their rights.
8. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers and service providers to ensure that they are equipped to work with this population and understand their unique experiences and challenges.
9. Community Decision-Making Forums: Host community decision-making forums where these individuals can come together to discuss their needs and priorities, and provide feedback on policies and programs that affect them.
