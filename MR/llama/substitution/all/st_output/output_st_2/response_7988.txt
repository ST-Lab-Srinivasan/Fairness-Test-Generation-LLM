Creating more inclusive cultural programs for upper lower-middle-income non-disabled individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the cultural program is accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or braille materials for those who need them.
2. Representation: Make sure the cultural program reflects the diversity of the community it serves. Include art, music, and performances that represent different cultures, ethnicities, and perspectives.
3. Inclusive programming: Offer programs that are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. For example, include sensory-friendly events or programs that are designed for individuals with autism or other neurodiverse conditions.
4. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness around disability and inclusion issues. This can help to break down stigmas and promote a more inclusive culture.
5. Partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that serve individuals with disabilities or other underrepresented groups. This can help to ensure that the cultural program is inclusive and accessible to everyone.
6. Feedback and evaluation: Regularly gather feedback from participants and evaluate the effectiveness of the cultural program in promoting inclusion. Use this feedback to make improvements and adjustments as needed.
7. Training: Provide training for staff, volunteers, and artists involved in the cultural program on disability etiquette and inclusion issues. This can help to ensure that everyone is comfortable and confident in creating an inclusive environment.
8. Involvement of individuals with disabilities: Actively involve individuals with disabilities in the planning, development, and implementation of the cultural program. This can help to ensure that the program is responsive to their needs and concerns.
9. Flexibility: Be flexible and willing to accommodate the diverse needs of participants. This can include providing different formats or schedules for events, or offering individualized support as needed.
10. Continuous improvement: Regularly review and update the cultural program to ensure that it remains inclusive and accessible. Seek feedback from participants and make adjustments as needed to improve the overall experience.
