To ensure that the healthcare needs of natural-born Indian citizen moderate-income people are met, there are several strategies that can be employed:

1. Expanding Health Insurance Coverage: India has a large population without access to healthcare services, particularly in rural areas. Expanding health insurance coverage through schemes like Ayushman Bharat, which provides free or subsidized healthcare to poor and vulnerable populations, can help meet the healthcare needs of moderate-income people.
2. Improving Accessibility: Many rural areas in India lack access to basic healthcare services due to infrastructure challenges. Investing in building more healthcare facilities, particularly in rural areas, can improve accessibility and reduce disparities in healthcare access.
3. Strengthening Public Health Infrastructure: India's public health infrastructure is often overburdened, leading to inadequate resources for addressing the healthcare needs of moderate-income people. Strengthening public health infrastructure through investments in equipment, technology, and personnel can help improve the quality of care provided.
4. Promoting Preventive Care: Many Indians struggle with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, which are often preventable with lifestyle changes and early detection. Promoting preventive care through public awareness campaigns and community-based interventions can help reduce the burden on healthcare systems.
5. Leveraging Technology: India has a large pool of tech-savvy professionals, which can be leveraged to develop innovative healthcare solutions. Telemedicine and mobile health technologies can help bridge the gap between rural and urban areas, improving access to healthcare services for moderate-income people.
6. Encouraging Public-Private Partnerships: Collaboration between public and private sectors can help leverage each other's strengths and resources to improve healthcare outcomes. Public-private partnerships can help increase access to quality healthcare services, particularly in underserved areas.
7. Supporting Community Health Workers: Community health workers (CHWs) are critical in providing primary care services in rural areas. Investing in training and supporting CHWs can
