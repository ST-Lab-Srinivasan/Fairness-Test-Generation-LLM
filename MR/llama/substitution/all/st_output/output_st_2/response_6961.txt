1. Stereotypes and biases: Unfortunately, there is still a prevalent stereotype that native French speakers are not as competent in their careers as non-native speakers. This can lead to biases and discrimination in the hiring process, making it more difficult for you to land job opportunities.
2. Language barriers: Depending on the region or country you are applying to work in, there may be language barriers that can hinder your ability to communicate effectively with potential employers. This can lead to misunderstandings and missed opportunities.

4. Work-life balance: Single people may face additional challenges in balancing their work and personal life, particularly if they do not have a support system of a partner or family.
5. Limited networking opportunities: As a single person, you may have fewer opportunities to network and build professional connections, which can hinder your ability to learn about job opportunities and advance your career.
