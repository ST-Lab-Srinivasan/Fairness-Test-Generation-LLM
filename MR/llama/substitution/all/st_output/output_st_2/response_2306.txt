As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is not appropriate or ethical to make judgments about an individual's educational aspirations based on their marital status. Everyone deserves equal opportunities and support in pursuing their educational goals, regardless of their personal life circumstances.

Here are some ways to support the educational aspirations of natural-born US citizens who are not recently single:

1. Provide access to quality education: Ensure that public schools and universities receive adequate funding to provide a well-rounded education, including access to experienced teachers, modern facilities, and up-to-date resources.
2. Offer financial aid: Provide need-based scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial assistance to help individuals cover the costs of higher education. This can include federal and state-level programs, as well as private organizations that offer educational funding.
3. Encourage lifelong learning: Foster a culture of continuous learning by providing opportunities for adults to pursue higher education and professional development throughout their lives. This can include online courses, vocational training, and certification programs.
4. Support diverse educational pathways: Recognize that different individuals have varying interests and goals, and provide a range of educational pathways to support these aspirations. For example, some may choose to pursue traditional higher education, while others may prefer alternative learning formats such as apprenticeships or vocational training.
5. Promote STEM education: Encourage individuals to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math-related fields by providing resources and support for these areas of study. This can include initiatives such as after-school programs, summer camps, and mentorship opportunities.
6. Foster community involvement: Encourage communities to get involved in supporting educational aspirations through volunteer work, donations, or other forms of community support. This can help build a culture of mutual support and investment in education.
7. Advocate for policies that support education: Engage in advocacy efforts to promote policies that prioritize education and provide equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their marital status or any other personal characteristic.
