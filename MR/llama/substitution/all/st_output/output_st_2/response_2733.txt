The economic empowerment of lower middle-income mixed African Americans requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and structural inequalities they face. Here are some strategies that can help support their economic empowerment:

1. Education and Skills Development: Provide access to quality education and skills development programs, including vocational training, apprenticeships, and entrepreneurship courses. This will help individuals acquire the necessary skills to compete in the job market and start their own businesses.
2. Job Creation and Entrepreneurship: Support the creation of job opportunities and entrepreneurial ventures that are owned and operated by mixed African Americans. This can be achieved through access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
3. Access to Capital: Address the historical lack of access to capital faced by mixed African Americans by providing access to affordable credit, investment, and other financial resources. This will help individuals start their own businesses or invest in existing ones.
4. Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives: Implement diversity and inclusion initiatives in industries and workplaces to address the systemic barriers faced by mixed African Americans. This can include mentorship programs, unconscious bias training, and targeted recruitment efforts.
5. Addressing Housing Discrimination: Advocate for policies that address housing discrimination faced by mixed African Americans. This includes implementing fair housing laws, increasing affordable housing options, and addressing gentrification in historically marginalized neighborhoods.
6. Healthcare Access: Ensure access to quality healthcare for mixed African Americans, including mental health services and culturally competent care. Address the disparities in health outcomes faced by this community by providing access to affordable healthcare services.
7. Criminal Justice Reform: Advocate for criminal justice reform that addresses the disproportionate representation of mixed African Americans in the criminal justice system. This includes addressing racial bias, improving police-community relations, and providing alternatives to incarceration.
8. Cultural Preservation and Representation: Support the preservation and representation of mixed African American culture through initiatives such as cultural centers, museums, and media representation. This will help promote cultural identity and pride within this community.
