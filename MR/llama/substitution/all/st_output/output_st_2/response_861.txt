Supporting the civic engagement of long-term, undocumented Native natural-born US citizens requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and barriers. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Advocate for immigration reform: Encourage your elected representatives to pass comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including those who have been in the US for an extended period.
2. Provide legal support: Connect them with pro bono lawyers or organizations that can provide free or low-cost legal services to help them navigate the complex immigration system.
3. Offer language classes: Many undocumented Native citizens may face language barriers, so providing language classes or connecting them with local organizations that offer such services can help them access information and resources more easily.
4. Build community connections: Facilitate connections between undocumented Native citizens and their local communities by organizing cultural events, workshops, or other activities that promote mutual understanding and respect.
5. Provide financial support: Offer financial assistance to help cover basic needs such as food, housing, and healthcare for those who are struggling to make ends meet.
6. Create safe spaces: Establish safe spaces where undocumented Native citizens can share their experiences and connect with others without fear of judgment or discrimination.
7. Engage in advocacy campaigns: Participate in advocacy campaigns that raise awareness about the issues faced by undocumented Native citizens, such as racial profiling, discrimination, and lack of access to basic rights and services.
8. Provide mental health support: Offer mental health services or connect them with organizations that provide culturally sensitive counseling and therapy to help them cope with the stress and trauma associated with their immigration status.
9. Foster cultural preservation: Support efforts to preserve Native American culture and traditions by providing resources for cultural expression, such as language classes, music workshops, or traditional art classes.
10. Build coalitions: Collaborate with other organizations, community groups, and advocacy networks to amplify the voices of undocumented Native citizens and push for systemic change at the local, state, and federal levels.
