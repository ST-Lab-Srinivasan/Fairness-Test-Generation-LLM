Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American, recent immigrant, and monastic Buddhist individuals in the United States. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular group or society. For these individuals, their cultural heritage is deeply connected to their spirituality and religious practices, and it influences how they understand themselves and their place in the world.

Native American individuals have a rich cultural heritage that is rooted in their traditional beliefs, practices, and traditions. Their cultural heritage includes their connection to the land, their ancestors, and their community.
