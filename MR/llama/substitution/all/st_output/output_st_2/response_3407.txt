Creating more inclusive social policies for partnered temporary visa holder individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these individuals. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to create a more inclusive society:

1. Acknowledge the challenges: The first step is to acknowledge the challenges faced by partnered temporary visa holders, such as limited access to social security benefits, healthcare, and education. Recognizing these challenges is crucial in developing policies that address them effectively.
2. Extend social security benefits: Partnered temporary visa holders should be eligible for social security benefits, including spousal benefits, to ensure they have access to financial support. This can include extending the duration of benefits for these individuals and providing them with the same level of coverage as permanent residents.
3. Improve access to healthcare: Partnered temporary visa holders should have improved access to healthcare services, including access to publicly-funded health insurance programs. This can help ensure that they receive necessary medical care without facing financial hardship.
4. Enhance education opportunities: Partnered temporary visa holders should have equal access to educational opportunities as permanent residents. This can include providing them with financial support for tuition fees, textbooks, and other educational expenses.
5. Promote cultural integration: Encouraging cultural integration is essential in creating a more inclusive society. Governments can promote cultural exchange programs, language training, and other initiatives that foster cross-cultural understanding and respect.
6. Address employment discrimination: Partnered temporary visa holders often face discrimination in the workplace due to their immigration status. Governments can implement policies to protect these individuals from employment discrimination and ensure they have equal access to job opportunities.
7. Provide legal support: Partnered temporary visa holders may face legal barriers that prevent them from accessing certain social services. Governments can provide legal support and representation to help these individuals navigate the complex immigration system.
