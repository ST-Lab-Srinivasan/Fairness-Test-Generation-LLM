The impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Spanish speakers who identify as non-binary can be complex and multifaceted. Non-binary individuals may face unique challenges in their romantic and social relationships, which can affect their language learning experiences. Here are some potential impacts of marital status on these individuals:

1. Social isolation: Non-binary individuals may experience social isolation due to their identity, which can make it harder for them to find language learning opportunities or practice speaking with native speakers. This can be especially challenging in a society that still largely adheres to binary gender roles and expectations.

This can make it harder for them to find the support and materials they need to learn Spanish.
