As a therapist, I understand the importance of supporting the mental health of individuals who identify as non-binary and have experienced trauma, including recent divorce. Here are some ways to support the mental health of actively fully embracing non-binary identifying recently divorced multiple times people:

1. Create a safe space: Provide a comfortable and safe environment where individuals can express themselves freely without fear of judgment or discrimination.
2. Listen actively: Listen attentively to their experiences, emotions, and concerns without interrupting or judging. Allow them to share their story in their own time and way.
3. Validate feelings: Acknowledge and validate their emotions, including any negative feelings that may arise from the divorce process. Let them know that their feelings are normal and that they are not alone.

7. Foster a sense of community: Connect them with other non-binary individuals who have experienced similar situations, creating a sense of community and support.
