Promoting the inclusion of gender-nonconforming Nigerian individuals in casual athletics requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the social, cultural, and structural barriers that prevent them from participating fully. Here are some strategies that can help promote their inclusion:

1. Education and awareness: Educate coaches, officials, and other stakeholders about the experiences and challenges faced by gender-nonconforming individuals in Nigeria. This can include workshops, training sessions, and community outreach programs that raise awareness about the importance of inclusivity in sports.
2. Policy changes: Review existing policies and regulations that govern athletics in Nigeria to ensure they are inclusive and supportive of gender-nonconforming individuals. This may involve changing language or terminology that is offensive or exclusionary, or creating new policies that promote inclusion.
3. Support networks: Establish support networks for gender-nonconforming athletes in Nigeria. This can include peer support groups, mentorship programs, and counseling services that provide emotional and psychological support to these individuals.
4. Accessibility and infrastructure: Ensure that sports facilities and equipment are accessible and inclusive of gender-nonconforming individuals. This may involve adapting existing facilities or creating new ones that are designed to meet the needs of this group.
5. Scholarships and funding: Provide scholarships and financial support to gender-nonconforming athletes in Nigeria. This can help them access training and competition opportunities, which can promote their inclusion and development.
6. Advocacy and activism: Engage in advocacy and activism to challenge discriminatory attitudes and practices that prevent gender-nonconforming individuals from participating in athletics. This may involve working with local communities, civil society organizations, and government agencies to promote policy changes and social attitudes that support inclusion.
7. Collaboration with international organizations: Collaborate with international organizations that promote inclusivity in sports, such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the National Center for Lesbian Rights (NCLR). These organizations can provide technical assistance, training, and advocacy support to help promote the inclusion of gender-nonconforming individuals in Nigerian athletics.
