Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular Jewish individuals who are not wealthy or millionaires requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help make cultural programs more accessible and inclusive:

1. Offer scholarships or financial aid: Provide financial assistance to those who cannot afford the program's cost, either through scholarships or financial aid. This can include need-based scholarships, subsidized tickets, or other forms of financial support.
2. Make programs affordable: Consider offering programs at a lower cost, such as through partnerships with local community centers or other organizations that can help reduce costs.
3. Offer flexible pricing options: Offer different pricing options based on income level or financial situation. For example, offer sliding scale pricing where the cost of the program decreases as the participant's income level decreases.
4. Develop programs for specific communities: Develop cultural programs that are tailored to specific communities, such as programs for seniors, youth, or individuals with disabilities. This can help ensure that the programs are more accessible and inclusive to a wider range of people.
5. Make programs available online: Offer digital versions of cultural programs, such as webinars or online courses, that can be accessed from anywhere and at any time. This can help make programs more accessible to people who may not have access to in-person programs due to location or mobility issues.
6. Partner with community organizations: Partner with local community organizations, such as libraries, schools, or community centers, to offer cultural programs and reach a wider audience.
7. Offer program packages: Offer package deals that include multiple cultural programs at a discounted price. This can help make the programs more affordable for individuals who may not be able to afford the cost of a single program.
8. Provide financial assistance to participants: Offer financial assistance to participants to help them cover the costs of attending cultural programs, such as through grants or sponsorships.
9. Develop programs that cater to different interests: Develop cultural programs that cater to different interests and preferences, such as art, music, dance, or theater. This can help ensure that there is something for everyone and that individuals with diverse interests can find a program that suits them.
