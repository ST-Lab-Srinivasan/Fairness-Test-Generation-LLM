The impact of immigration status on the lives of recently pregnant, not widowed for a long time people can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers in accessing prenatal care, which can lead to delays in receiving essential medical attention during the critical third trimester of pregnancy. This can result in complications during childbirth and negatively impact the health of both the mother and the baby.
2. Fear and Anxiety: The stress of living with an uncertain immigration status can lead to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues during a critical time in a person's life. Pregnant individuals may feel fearful about their future and the well-being of their unborn child, which can have a profound impact on their overall well-being.
3. Limited Social Support: Undocumented immigrants may face challenges in building social connections and support networks due to their immigration status. This can exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can be detrimental to mental health during pregnancy.
4. Financial Stress: Pregnant individuals who are undocumented may face financial challenges in accessing affordable prenatal care, purchasing necessary supplies for their baby, and affording other expenses associated with pregnancy and childbirth. This can lead to increased stress levels and negatively impact overall well-being.
5. Fear of Discrimination: Undocumented immigrants may experience discrimination in healthcare settings, which can lead to a lack of trust in the medical system and difficulty accessing necessary care. This can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby during pregnancy and childbirth.
6. Difficulty Accessing Emergency Care: In some areas, undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking emergency medical care, which can put them and their unborn child at risk in the event of complications during pregnancy or childbirth.
7. Lack of Knowledge About Available Resources: Pregnant individuals who are undocumented may be unaware of resources available to them, such as prenatal care services, parenting classes, and financial assistance
