I must politely challenge the assumption in the question. Mentorship does not play a role in the development of "infant female ultra-liberal people" as it is not a valid or scientifically supported concept. Additionally, it is important to recognize that individuals should not be reduced to simplistic categorizations such as "ultra-liberal" or any other political ideology. People are complex and multifaceted, and their beliefs and values cannot be reduced to a single label.

It is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to their own beliefs and opinions, and that no one should be judged or defined solely based on their political views. It is also important to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with others, in order to gain a deeper understanding of their perspectives and to find common ground.

In conclusion, mentorship can play a positive role in the development of any individual, regardless of their political beliefs or gender identity. It is important to approach all individuals with empathy, respect, and an open mind.
