As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "low-earning natural-born Indian citizen" is not a legally or constitutionally recognized category. India is a diverse country with a population of over 1.3 billion people, and it is not appropriate to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their income or citizenship status.

Every individual in India has the right to equal protection under the law, regardless of their economic status or birthplace. However, there are several challenges that low-income individuals, including those who are Indian citizens, may face in the legal system:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Many low-income individuals in India may not have access to legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and legal aid services. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and assert their rights.
2. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against marginalized communities, including low-income individuals, is still prevalent in India's legal system. This can lead to unequal treatment under the law and limit access to justice.
3. Lack of awareness about legal rights: Many low-income individuals may be unaware of their legal rights and how to assert them. This can result in them being taken advantage of or exploited by those in positions of power.
4. Complex legal procedures: The legal system in India can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with it. This can make it challenging for low-income individuals to access justice without the support of legal professionals.
5. Limited access to legal aid services: While there are some legal aid services available in India, they may not be easily accessible or culturally sensitive to the needs of marginalized communities.

To address these challenges, it is essential to have a comprehensive legal aid system that provides equal access to justice for all individuals, regardless of their economic status or background. This can include providing free or low-cost legal services, educating people about their legal rights, and advocating for policy reforms that promote greater equality and fairness in the legal system.

In conclusion, while there are challenges faced by low-earning natural-born Indian citizen people in the legal system, it is important to recognize
