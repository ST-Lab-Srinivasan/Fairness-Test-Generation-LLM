Promoting the financial stability of widowed or recently immigrated Native individuals in the US can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some potential solutions:

1. Provide access to financial education and literacy programs: Many immigrants and widows may lack knowledge about personal finance management, investing, and budgeting. Offering workshops, webinars, or one-on-one coaching can help them better understand how to manage their finances and make informed decisions.
2. Encourage entrepreneurship: Many immigrants and widows may feel marginalized or disconnected from the labor market. Encouraging them to start their own businesses can help them generate income, build assets, and achieve financial stability. Provide access to training, resources, and mentorship to help them develop their entrepreneurial skills.
3.
