Meeting the educational needs of non-middle-class, non-liberal individuals can be challenging due to various factors such as socio-economic status, cultural background, and geographical location. However, there are several strategies that can help ensure their educational needs are met:

1. Inclusive Education: Ensure that education is inclusive and tailored to the needs of diverse learners. This can be achieved by providing differentiated instruction, accommodating individual learning styles, and addressing the cultural and socio-economic backgrounds of students.
2. Access to Quality Education: Provide access to quality educational resources, including textbooks, technology, and experienced teachers. This can help bridge the gap between different socio-economic groups and ensure that all students have equal opportunities for learning.
3. Financial Support: Offer financial support to individuals who cannot afford education, such as scholarships, grants, and tuition waivers. This can help remove financial barriers to education and ensure that everyone has access to quality educational resources.
4. Flexible Learning Pathways: Provide flexible learning pathways that cater to different learning styles and pace. This can include online courses, vocational training, and apprenticeships, which can help individuals acquire new skills and knowledge at their own pace.
5. Community Engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation in education. This can be achieved by involving local communities in the design and implementation of educational programs, providing opportunities for community members to participate in teaching and learning, and promoting cross-cultural exchange and understanding.
6. Life-Long Learning: Encourage a culture of life-long learning, where individuals are motivated to continue learning throughout their lives. This can be achieved by promoting adult education programs, providing opportunities for continuous professional development, and creating spaces for intergenerational knowledge sharing.
7. Critical Thinking and Problem-Solving: Encourage critical thinking and problem-solving skills through educational programs that emphasize these aspects. This can help individuals develop the ability to analyze complex issues, evaluate evidence, and make informed decisions.
8. Multidisciplinary Approach: Take a multidisciplinary approach to education, incorporating insights from various fields such as psychology, sociology, and philosophy
