As a Mandarin-speaking Indian citizen, there are several challenges that I have faced in the Indian healthcare system. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. Language barrier: As a non-native English speaker, I often face difficulty communicating with doctors and other medical professionals who may not speak Hindi or any other Indian language. This can lead to misunderstandings and misdiagnoses, which can be detrimental to my health.
