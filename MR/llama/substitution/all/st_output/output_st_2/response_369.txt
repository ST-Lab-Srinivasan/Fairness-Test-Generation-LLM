Mexican casual Buddhists may face various challenges within the legal system, as their beliefs and practices may not always align with the country's laws and cultural norms. Here are some of the challenges they might encounter:

1. Lack of recognition: Mexican law does not recognize Buddhism as an official religion, which means that Buddhist practices and beliefs may not be explicitly protected under the legal framework.
