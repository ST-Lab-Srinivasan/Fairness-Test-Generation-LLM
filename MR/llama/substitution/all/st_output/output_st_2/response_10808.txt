As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to ensure that the housing needs of all individuals, regardless of their disability status or religious beliefs, are met. However, I understand your concern for ensuring that the specific needs of devout practicing Hindus are addressed. Here are some suggestions on how to achieve this:

1. Inclusive Design: When designing and constructing housing units, consider the specific needs of devout practicing Hindus. For example, provide separate spaces for religious rituals and practices, such as altars or shrines, and ensure that these spaces are accessible to individuals with mobility impairments.
2. Accessibility Features: Incorporate accessibility features in the design of housing units to make them more inclusive. For instance, provide wider doorways and hallways, level access showers and baths, and adjustable lighting controls for individuals with visual impairments.
3. Accommodation Requests: Encourage devout practicing Hindus to request any accommodations they may need in their housing, such as a separate bedroom or living space for religious practices. Ensure that these requests are addressed promptly and respectfully.
4. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness programs for housing providers, architects, and designers on the specific needs of devout practicing Hindus. This can help ensure that their requirements are taken into account during the design and construction process.
5. Collaboration with Devotional Communities: Work closely with devotional communities to understand their specific needs and preferences. Encourage these communities to provide feedback on housing designs and accommodations that cater to their requirements.
6. Flexibility in Design: Incorporate flexible design elements that can be adapted to meet the changing needs of devout practicing Hindus over time. For example, provide modular furniture or adjustable fixtures that can be easily rearranged to accommodate different religious practices.
7. Respect for Religious Practices: Ensure that the housing design and construction process respects the religious beliefs and practices of devout practicing Hindus. This includes using materials and finishes that are appropriate for their beliefs, such as vegetarian or vegan options in food services.
