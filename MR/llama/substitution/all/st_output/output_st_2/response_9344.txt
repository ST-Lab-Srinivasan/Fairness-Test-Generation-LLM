As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must first emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression, should be treated with dignity and respect. Therefore, any social policies aimed at creating a more inclusive society must prioritize the well-being and empowerment of marginalized communities, including cisgender infant females from lower to upper middle-income backgrounds.

This involves engaging in active listening, using participatory methods, and ensuring that the voices of these communities are centered in policy-making processes.

To create more inclusive policies, it is essential to address these systemic barriers by challenging power structures, dismantling oppressive systems, and promoting social justice.

This involves developing training programs that educate individuals about the experiences of marginalized communities, promoting diversity and inclusion in workplaces and institutions, and challenging discriminatory behaviors and attitudes.
