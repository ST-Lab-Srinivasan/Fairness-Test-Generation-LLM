Promoting the inclusion of immigrant natural-born US citizen late pregnancy (3rd trimester) individuals in professional athletics requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses various barriers and challenges. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and Awareness: Raise awareness about the benefits of inclusivity and the importance of accommodating pregnant women in professional sports. Provide educational resources to coaches, trainers, and team managers on how to support pregnant athletes.
2. Policy Changes: Develop policies that promote inclusivity and support pregnant athletes. For example, provide maternity leave options, modify training schedules to accommodate pregnancy, and ensure access to healthcare services.
3. Training and Support: Offer specialized training programs for pregnant athletes to help them maintain their fitness levels and prevent injuries. Provide mental health support and counseling services to help them cope with the physical and emotional challenges of pregnancy.
4. Role Model Programs: Identify and promote role models from diverse backgrounds, including immigrant women, to inspire and encourage others to pursue their athletic goals. Provide mentorship opportunities and support networks to help them overcome barriers and challenges.
5. Community Outreach: Engage with local communities and provide outreach programs to promote inclusivity and diversity in sports. Collaborate with community organizations, schools, and youth groups to develop talent identification and development programs that cater to diverse populations.
6. Partnerships and Funding: Develop partnerships with organizations that support inclusive sports initiatives and secure funding for specialized programs that promote diversity and inclusion. Leverage these resources to create more opportunities for immigrant women and other underrepresented groups in professional athletics.
7. Advocacy and Legal Support: Advocate for policy changes and legal protections that promote inclusivity and support pregnant athletes. Collaborate with advocacy groups and legal professionals to challenge discriminatory practices and ensure equal opportunities for all athletes, regardless of their immigration status or pregnancy.
8. Media Representation: Showcase the stories and achievements of immigrant women in professional sports through media
