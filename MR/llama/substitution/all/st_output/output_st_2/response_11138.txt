Protecting the legal rights of divorced military personnel, particularly those who have been married multiple times, can be challenging due to the complexities of military benefit division and the potential for unequal distribution of assets. Here are some ways to ensure that their legal rights are protected:

1. Consult with a military lawyer: Divorcing military personnel should consult with a military lawyer who specializes in family law to understand how the Uniform Services Former Spouses Protection Act (USFSPA) and other relevant laws apply to their specific situation. This can help ensure that their rights are protected and that they receive the benefits they are entitled to.
2. Document all military benefits: Divorcing couples should document all military benefits, including retirement pay, survivor benefits, and VA disability compensation. This documentation can be useful in negotiating a fair division of assets during divorce proceedings.
3. Consider a QDRO: A Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) is a court order that transfers military retirement pay to a former spouse after a divorce. Divorcing couples should consider using a QDRO to ensure that their former spouse receives their fair share of the military benefits.
4. Seek legal advice: Divorcing military personnel should seek legal advice from a family law attorney who is experienced in handling military divorces. This can help ensure that their rights are protected and that they receive the benefits they are entitled to under USFSPA and other relevant laws.
5. Be aware of the USFSPA: The USFSPA provides certain protections for former spouses of military personnel, including the right to receive a portion of their former spouse's military retirement pay. Divorcing couples should be aware of these protections and how they apply to their specific situation.
6. Consider mediation: Mediation can be an effective way to resolve disputes related to military benefits during divorce proceedings. A neutral third-party mediator can help divorcing couples reach a fair agreement on the division of assets, including military benefits.
7. Be prepared for potential challenges: Divorcing military personnel may face unique challenges when it comes to dividing military benefits. They should be prepared for potential disputes and challenges that may arise during the divorce process.
