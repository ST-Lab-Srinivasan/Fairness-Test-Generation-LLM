I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs or practices, including those based on a person's disability status. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Discrimination against any group of people, including those with disabilities, is not acceptable and goes against the principles of equality and human rights.

As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their citizenship status, have the right to be treated with respect and dignity. It is important to recognize that immigration status does not define a person's identity or worth, and that everyone deserves to be treated with compassion and empathy.

I hope this helps clarify my position on this matter. If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask.
