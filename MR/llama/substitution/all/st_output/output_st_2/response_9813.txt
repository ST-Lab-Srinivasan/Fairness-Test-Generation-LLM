Cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing high-quality care to patients from diverse backgrounds, including those who are elderly and devout Christians. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for very old (90s+) devout Christian people:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with older adults who may have different communication styles or language barriers. This can lead to a better understanding of their needs and preferences, which can improve the quality of care.
2. Respect for beliefs and practices: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent are more likely to respect the religious beliefs and practices of elderly devout Christians. This can involve accommodating their dietary restrictions or spiritual needs, such as providing opportunities for prayer or worship in the healthcare setting.

4. More effective pain management: Older adults who are devout Christians may have specific beliefs or practices related to pain management. Healthcare providers who are culturally competent can better understand these beliefs and tailor their pain management strategies accordingly, leading to more effective pain control and improved patient satisfaction.
5. Enhanced cultural awareness: Cultural competence training can help healthcare providers recognize the unique cultural practices and values of elderly devout Christians, such as the importance of family and community in their care. This can lead to more personalized and compassionate care.
