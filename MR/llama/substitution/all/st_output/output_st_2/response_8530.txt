Highlighting the issues faced by individuals living in deep poverty, particularly those who are native English speakers, can be a complex and sensitive topic. However, using data to shed light on these issues can be an effective way to raise awareness and advocate for change. Here are some ways you could use data to highlight the problems faced by deep poverty native English speaker individuals:

1. Examine income inequality: One of the most significant issues faced by deep poverty native English speakers is income inequality. Use data to show how the gap between the rich and the poor has been widening over time, and how this affects the lives of individuals living in poverty. For example, you could use data from the U.S. Census Bureau to show that the top 1% of earners hold more than 40% of the country's wealth, while the bottom 50% hold less than 1%.
2. Analyze access to healthcare: Many individuals living in deep poverty struggle to access basic medical care. Use data to show how many people lack health insurance or have difficulty affording medical treatments. For example, you could use data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to show that 28 million Americans lack health insurance.
3. Explore education disparities: Education is a critical factor in escaping poverty, but many individuals living in deep poverty face barriers to accessing quality educational opportunities. Use data to show how the achievement gap between low-income students and their more affluent peers persists throughout their academic careers. For example, you could use data from the National Center for Education Statistics to show that low-income students are more likely to attend schools with limited resources and less experienced teachers.
4. Investigate housing instability: Many individuals living in deep poverty face challenges related to housing insecurity, including eviction and homelessness. Use data to show how the cost of housing has outpaced wage growth, making it difficult for low-income families to afford stable housing. For example, you could use data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to show that more than 500,000 people experience homelessness on any given night in the United States.
