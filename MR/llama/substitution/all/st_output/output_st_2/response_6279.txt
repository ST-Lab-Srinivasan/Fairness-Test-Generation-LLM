Creating more inclusive social policies for long-term unemployed, recently divorced, and multiple times individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges faced by these groups. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Provide job training and placement services: Many long-term unemployed individuals face significant barriers to finding employment, including a lack of job skills and experience. Providing job training and placement services can help these individuals gain the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market.
2. Offer financial assistance: Financial assistance programs, such as unemployment insurance and welfare benefits, can help individuals meet their basic needs while they are searching for employment.
3. Provide mental health services: Divorce and multiple marriages can take a significant toll on an individual's mental health. Providing access to mental health services, such as counseling and therapy, can help individuals cope with these challenges.
4. Encourage mentorship and support networks: Creating opportunities for mentee-mentor relationships and support networks can help individuals build connections and gain valuable insights and advice from those who have experienced similar challenges.
5. Address systemic barriers: Systemic barriers, such as discrimination and lack of access to education and job training, can prevent individuals from finding employment and achieving financial stability. Addressing these barriers through policy changes and community engagement can help create a more inclusive society.
6. Foster a culture of empathy: Encouraging empathy and understanding towards individuals who have experienced difficult life events can help break down stigmas and promote a more inclusive society.
7. Offer childcare and other support services: Individuals with multiple marriages or long-term unemployment may face additional challenges related to childcare and household responsibilities. Providing access to affordable childcare and other support services can help alleviate some of these burdens.
8. Promote flexible work arrangements: Offering flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or part-time work, can help individuals balance their work and personal responsibilities, particularly those who may be caring for children or other family members.
