Disability status can have significant impacts on the lives of documented, non-lifelong single people. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social isolation: Individuals with disabilities may face social isolation due to discrimination, stigma, or limited access to social spaces and events. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and low self-esteem.
2. Inaccessible living environments: Many buildings and public spaces are not designed to be accessible for individuals with disabilities. This can limit their ability to participate in everyday activities and social interactions.
3. Limited employment opportunities: Individuals with disabilities may face discrimination or biases in the workplace, leading to limited job opportunities or career advancement. They may also have difficulty accessing transportation or other resources necessary for employment.
4. Financial inequality: Disability can result in significant financial strain due to increased healthcare costs, assistive technology expenses, and lost income due to discrimination or lack of job opportunities.
5. Lack of representation and voice: Individuals with disabilities may feel underrepresented or unheard in society, leading to a sense of powerlessness and marginalization.
6. Internalized stigma: Disability can lead to internalized stigma, where individuals with disabilities begin to view themselves through the lens of ableism and discrimination, leading to lower self-esteem and self-worth.
7. Emotional distress: Living with a disability can cause significant emotional distress, including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
8. Lack of autonomy: Individuals with disabilities may face limitations in their ability to make decisions and take control of their lives due to systemic barriers and lack of support.
9. Health disparities: Disability can lead to health disparities, including increased rates of chronic illnesses, mental health issues, and premature mortality.
10. Limited access to healthcare: Individuals with disabilities may face challenges in accessing healthcare services due to physical or attitudinal barriers, leading to delayed or inadequate care.
