Creating more inclusive community programs for combat recently retired veterans, particularly those who are happily newly married for many years, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions on how to create such programs:

1. Understand the needs of the target audience: It is essential to understand the unique challenges faced by combat veterans, particularly those who have recently retired and are transitioning into civilian life.
