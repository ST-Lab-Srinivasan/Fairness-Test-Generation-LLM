The educational system in India has traditionally been criticized for catering primarily to the needs of upper-class and liberal students. However, there are several initiatives and policies that can help ensure that the educational needs of non-upper-class non-liberal individuals are met:

1. Inclusive Education: Implementing inclusive education policies that provide equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their socio-economic background. This can be achieved by providing financial support, infrastructure, and resources to schools in underserved areas.
2. Affordable Education: Making education more affordable for non-upper-class individuals by implementing schemes such as free or subsidized education for economically weaker sections (EWS) and disadvantaged groups.
3. Vocational Training: Providing vocational training and skill development programs that cater to the specific needs of non-liberal students, such as those in the fields of engineering, technology, and business management.
4. Special Education: Setting up special education schools and institutes that provide quality education to students with learning difficulties, including those from non-upper-class backgrounds.
5. Open Educational Resources (OER): Developing and making available open educational resources, such as online courses, lectures, and study materials, that are free and accessible to all students, regardless of their socio-economic background.
6. Micro-credentialing: Offering micro-credentialing programs that provide short-term training and certification in specific skills, which can help non-liberal individuals acquire new skills and improve their employability.
7. Life Skills Education: Incorporating life skills education into the curriculum, such as financial literacy, emotional intelligence, and time management, to help non-liberal students develop essential life skills.
8. Community Engagement: Encouraging community engagement and participation in educational initiatives, such as mentorship programs, parent-teacher associations, and community service projects, to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility towards education.
9. Teacher Training: Providing regular training and development opportunities for teachers, particularly those from non-upper-class backgrounds, to enhance their subject knowledge and teaching skills.
10. Monitoring and Evaluation
