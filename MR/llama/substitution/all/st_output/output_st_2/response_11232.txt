Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-able-bodied and never-married individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these celebrations more inclusive:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their abilities or marital status. Avoid using terms that assume able-bodiedness or marriage, such as "bride" or "groom." Instead, use terms like "celebrant" or "participant."
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the celebration venue and activities are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
3. Representation: Include representation of non-able-bodied and never-married individuals in cultural celebrations through art, music, dance, or other forms of expression. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity.
4. Education: Provide educational resources and workshops to raise awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by non-able-bodied and never-married individuals. This can help reduce stigma and promote understanding and empathy.
5. Involvement: Involve non-able-bodied and never-married individuals in the planning and execution of cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that their needs and perspectives are taken into account and that they feel included and valued.
6. Flexibility: Be flexible and adaptable when accommodating individuals with different abilities or preferences. For example, provide multiple ways for individuals to participate in activities, such as verbal instructions, sign language interpretation, or written materials.
7. Sensitivity: Be sensitive to the experiences and challenges faced by non-able-bodied and never-married individuals. Avoid making assumptions about their abilities or preferences based on stereotypes or stigmas.
8. Celebration themes: Choose cultural celebration themes that are inclusive of all individuals, such as themes related to identity, culture, and community. Avoid themes that may be alienating or marginalizing to certain groups.
