As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the term "natural-born Canadian citizen" is not a legally recognized or protected category in Canada. All individuals born in Canada or who have obtained Canadian citizenship through naturalization are considered Canadian citizens, regardless of their background or circumstances.

However, if you are advocating for the rights of specific individuals or groups within the Canadian population, there are several effective ways to do so:

1. Educate yourself and others: Learn about the relevant laws, policies, and social norms that affect the group you are advocating for. Share your knowledge with others to raise awareness and build support.
2. Engage with government officials: Reach out to elected representatives, bureaucrats, and other decision-makers to voice your concerns and propose solutions. Attend public consultations, write letters, and make phone calls to ensure your views are heard.
3. Collaborate with organizations: Partner with community groups, non-profits, or advocacy organizations that share your goals. Together, you can pool resources, expertise, and influence to achieve greater impact.
4. Leverage media coverage: Use local newspapers, social media, and other platforms to raise the profile of the issue you are advocating for. Share stories, data, and personal experiences to build empathy and support.
5. Organize events and protests: Host rallies, marches, or other events to bring attention to your cause. Use creative tactics, such as flash mobs or sit-ins, to draw attention and stimulate discussion.
6. Use the legal system: If you believe that an individual or group's rights have been violated, explore legal options for redress. Consult with lawyers and legal aid organizations to determine the best course of action.
7. Support advocacy initiatives: Encourage others to join your cause by sharing your experiences and the benefits of advocating for change. Offer support and resources to help them get involved in their own right.
8. Foster community engagement: Build relationships with local leaders, community groups, and other stakeholders to create a sense of shared responsibility and collective action. Encourage community members to take an active role in advocating for the rights of natural-born Canadian citizens
