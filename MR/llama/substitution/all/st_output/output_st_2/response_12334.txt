As a language model, I do not have personal opinions or endorse any particular political agendas. However, I can provide some general suggestions for legislative changes that could potentially benefit beginner Chinese speaker active-duty communities:

1. Language Training Support: Provide increased funding and resources for language training programs, including hiring more language instructors and offering more classes specifically tailored to the needs of beginner Chinese speakers.
2. Cultural Immersion Programs: Offer cultural immersion programs that allow active-duty service members to live and work in China for extended periods, providing them with an opportunity to fully immerse themselves in the language and culture.
3. Language Proficiency Testing: Establish a standardized language proficiency testing system for beginner Chinese speakers, allowing service members to accurately assess their progress and set realistic goals for their language learning journey.
4. Mobile Language Learning Tools: Develop and provide mobile apps or other digital tools that allow active-duty service members to access language learning resources anytime, anywhere, and in a format that is easy to use and understand.
5. Language Exchange Programs: Establish language exchange programs that connect beginner Chinese speakers with native Chinese speakers, providing them with an opportunity to practice speaking and listening in a supportive environment.
6. Simplification of China's Writing System: For service members who are learning the traditional Chinese writing system, consider simplifying the characters or adopting a more phonetic writing system to make it easier for beginners to learn and remember.
7. Flexible Learning Options: Offer flexible learning options, such as online courses or hybrid classes that combine online and in-person instruction, to accommodate the diverse schedules and needs of active-duty service members.
8. Personalized Learning Plans: Develop personalized language learning plans for each service member based on their individual learning style, goals, and progress, ensuring they receive tailored support and guidance throughout their language learning journey.
9. Culture-Rich Content: Incorporate culture-rich content into language learning materials and resources, such as videos, podcasts, or interactive lessons, to help service members develop a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and how it relates to the language they are learning.
10. Collaboration with Language Institutes:
