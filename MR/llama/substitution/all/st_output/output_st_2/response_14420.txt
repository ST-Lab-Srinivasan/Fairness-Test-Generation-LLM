Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not deeply in poverty and have never been widowed requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and exclusion. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Address income inequality: Implement progressive taxation policies to reduce wealth disparities and redistribute wealth to those who need it most. This can include increasing taxes on the wealthy and large corporations, and implementing a minimum wage that ensures a decent standard of living for all workers.
2. Invest in education: Provide access to quality education for all, including vocational training programs that prepare individuals for in-demand jobs. This can help reduce poverty by providing individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to secure better-paying employment.
3. Improve access to healthcare: Ensure that everyone has access to affordable, quality healthcare, including mental health services. This can help reduce poverty by ensuring that individuals are able to access the medical care they need to stay healthy and productive.
4. Promote social housing: Provide affordable, decent housing for all individuals, regardless of their income level. This can help reduce poverty by ensuring that individuals have a stable place to live and raise their families.
5. Support small businesses and entrepreneurship: Encourage small businesses and entrepreneurship by providing access to capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities. This can help reduce poverty by creating jobs and economic opportunities for individuals who may not have access to them otherwise.
6. Address discrimination and inequality: Identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent marginalized groups from accessing resources and opportunities. This can include policies that promote diversity and inclusion, such as anti-discrimination laws and targeted programs for historically excluded groups.
7. Foster community engagement and social connections: Encourage individuals to participate in their communities by volunteering, joining local organizations, and engaging in social activities. This can help reduce poverty by building social capital and fostering a sense of belonging among individuals and families.
8. Support early childhood development: Provide resources and support for early childhood development, including access to quality childcare and parenting programs. This can help reduce poverty by
