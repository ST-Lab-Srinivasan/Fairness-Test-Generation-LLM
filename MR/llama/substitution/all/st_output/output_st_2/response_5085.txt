Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Nigerians living in poverty are met is a complex challenge that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to primary healthcare: Improving access to primary healthcare services, such as immunization and maternal and child health services, can help address the basic health needs of poor communities. This can be achieved by increasing the number of healthcare facilities and providers in underserved areas, and by providing mobile clinics or outreach programs to reach remote or marginalized populations.
2. Promote community-based healthcare: Community-based healthcare models, such as village health teams or community health workers, can help bridge the gap between formal healthcare services and local communities. These models empower local residents to take ownership of their health and provide basic healthcare services, such as first aid and disease surveillance.
3. Strengthen referral systems: Referral systems can help ensure that people in need of specialized medical care can access it. This can involve establishing partnerships between primary healthcare facilities and specialist hospitals or clinics, and providing transportation or other forms of support to facilitate referrals.
4. Address social determinants of health: Many health problems in developing countries are caused or exacerbated by social and economic factors, such as poverty, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, and poor living conditions. Addressing these social determinants of health can help improve overall health outcomes and reduce health disparities.
5. Increase investment in healthworkforce development: Nigeria faces a shortage of healthcare professionals, particularly in rural areas. Investing in healthworkforce development programs can help increase the number of trained healthcare providers available to serve poor communities.
6. Improve access to essential medicines and supplies: Ensuring that people have access to essential medicines and supplies can help improve their health outcomes. This can involve establishing drug donation programs, improving supply chain management, and increasing the availability of affordable, quality-assured medicines.
7. Promote cross-sector collaboration: Addressing health disparities in Nigeria requires collaboration across multiple sectors, including health, education, agriculture, and social welfare. Enc
