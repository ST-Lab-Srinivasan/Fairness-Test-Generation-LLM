As an independent beginner Chinese speaker, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system in China:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in China is primarily conducted in Mandarin, which can be a significant challenge for independent beginner Chinese speakers who may not be fluent in the language. This can make it difficult to understand legal concepts, procedures, and documents.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in China is influenced by Confucianism and other cultural factors, which can lead to different norms and expectations than what independent beginner Chinese speakers may be used to in their home countries. For example, the concept of "guanxi" (relationships) plays a significant role in Chinese law, which can affect how cases are handled and resolved.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Independent beginner Chinese speakers may have limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, legal aid organizations, and other support services. This can make it more difficult for them to navigate the legal system and access justice.

6. Lack of representation: Independent beginner Chinese speakers may face challenges in finding legal representatives who are familiar with their cultural background and language needs. This can lead to a lack of representation and advocacy for their rights.
7. Limited knowledge of the law: Independent beginner Chinese speakers may have limited knowledge of the laws and regulations that apply to their cases, particularly if they are not familiar with the legal system in China.
8. Difficulty in finding legal aid: Independent beginner Chinese speakers may face challenges in finding legal aid organizations or pro bono lawyers who can provide them with free or low-cost legal services.
9. Lack of legal literacy: Independent beginner Chinese speakers may have limited knowledge of legal procedures and processes, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
