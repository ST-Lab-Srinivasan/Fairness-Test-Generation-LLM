Title: The Multifaceted Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Mixed Asian Identities

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed Asian heritage non-libertarian individuals. This group is characterized by their diverse racial and cultural backgrounds, which can include Asian, Pacific Islander, or Indigenous ancestries.
