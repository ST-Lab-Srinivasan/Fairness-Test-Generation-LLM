As a language learner, it can be challenging to balance the demands of daily life with the need to improve your English skills. Here are some ways that beginner English speakers who are married or have other commitments can support their educational aspirations:

1. Set realistic goals and priorities: Begin by setting achievable goals for yourself, such as learning a certain number of new words or phrases each day. Make sure your goals are specific, measurable, and attainable.
2. Create a study schedule: Plan out dedicated time each day to study English, even if it's just 15-20 minutes. Consistency is key when it comes to language learning.
3. Utilize online resources: There are many websites and apps that provide free or low-cost English language lessons. Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone are popular options.
4. Listen to English media: Listen to English podcasts, radio shows, or watch English TV series and movies with subtitles in your native language. This can help you improve your listening and comprehension skills.
5. Practice speaking with a language exchange partner: Find someone who speaks English as their first language and practice conversing with them regularly. This can help you improve your speaking skills and gain confidence in using the language.
6. Immerse yourself in the language: Surround yourself with English as much as possible. Read books, magazines, or newspapers in English, and try to have conversations with native speakers whenever possible.
7. Take advantage of free resources: Many libraries offer free English language learning resources, such as DVDs, CDs, and online tutorials. Utilize these resources to supplement your studies.
8. Join a language learning community: Look for local language exchange groups or online communities where you can connect with other learners and get support and motivation.
9. Be patient and persistent: Learning a new language takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself and keep practicing consistently.
10. Seek professional help: If you're serious about improving your English skills, consider hiring a tutor or enrolling in an English language course at a local college or language school.

Remember, learning a new language takes time and effort, but with dedication and consistency
