Title: Impact of Political Affiliation on Lives of Beginner Chinese Speakers Aged 65 and Over (Study of 85 People)

Abstract: This study examines the impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Chinese speakers aged 65 and over, who have recently learned the language. The participants were divided into three groups based on their political beliefs: communist, nationalist, and apolitical. The results show that political affiliation has a significant effect on the motivations, attitudes, and experiences of these learners. Communist learners reported higher levels of motivation and enjoyment in learning Chinese, while nationalist learners experienced more anxiety and pressure. Apolitical learners showed a neutral attitude towards their language learning. The findings highlight the importance of considering the political context when teaching Chinese to older adults.

Introduction:
As the global population ages, there is an increasing interest in learning Chinese as a second language. In particular, beginner Chinese speakers aged 65 and over (hereafter referred to as older learners) face unique challenges in their language learning journey. This study aims to investigate the impact of political affiliation on the lives of these learners. By examining the motivations, attitudes, and experiences of older learners with different political beliefs, we can gain insights into how political affiliation affects their language learning experience.

Methodology:
This study employed a mixed-methods design, combining both quantitative and qualitative data. A total of 85 older learners were recruited from local Chinese language schools in a major city in China. The participants were divided into three groups based on their political beliefs: communist (n = 27), nationalist (n = 24), and apolitical (n = 34). Each group consisted of learners who shared similar political views, creating a homogeneous sample within each group.

A survey questionnaire was administered to all participants, which assessed their motivations, attitudes, and experiences in learning Chinese. The questionnaire included items such as the reasons for learning Chinese, the level of enjoyment in language learning, and the perceived challenges in mastering the language. Additionally, a semi-structured interview was conducted with each participant to gather more in-depth qualitative
