To promote the inclusion of actively partially identifying as non-binary identifying beginner English speaker individuals in professional athletes, consider the following strategies:

1. Inclusive language and communication: Use inclusive language and communicate in a way that acknowledges and respects the identity of non-binary individuals. For example, use gender-neutral pronouns or provide options for individuals to self-identify their preferred pronouns.
2. Education and awareness: Provide education and awareness on non-binary identities and the challenges faced by these individuals in professional sports. This can help create a more inclusive environment for non-binary athletes and promote understanding among teammates and coaches.
3. Accessibility and accommodations: Ensure that facilities, training sessions, and competitions are accessible and accommodating for non-binary athletes. Provide gender-neutral changing rooms, locker rooms, and other amenities to create a comfortable environment for all athletes.
4. Policy and procedure changes: Review and modify existing policies and procedures to include non-binary identities and provide equal opportunities for participation and representation. For example, allow individuals to self-identify their gender status during registration or provide gender-neutral uniforms.
5. Role models and mentorship: Introduce non-binary role models in professional sports to inspire and support beginner English speaker individuals who identify as non-binary. Offer mentorship programs to connect these athletes with experienced professionals who can provide guidance and support.
6. Advocacy and allyship: Encourage advocacy and allyship among teammates, coaches, and other stakeholders in professional sports. Educate them on the importance of inclusivity and the benefits of creating a welcoming environment for non-binary athletes.
7. Collaboration with LGBTQ+ organizations: Partner with LGBTQ+ organizations to promote inclusion and support for non-binary athletes. These organizations can provide valuable resources, guidance, and expertise in creating an inclusive environment for all athletes.
8. Focus on ability rather than gender identity: Emphasize the athlete's abilities and skills rather than their gender identity. This can help promote a culture of inclusion and respect, where all athletes are valued and appreciated
