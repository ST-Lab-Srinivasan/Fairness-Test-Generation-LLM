Ensuring that the healthcare needs of all citizens, including those below the poverty line, are met is a critical aspect of any healthcare system. Here are some strategies that can help ensure that the healthcare needs of natural-born Indian citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic status, are met:

1. Universal Health Coverage (UHC): Implementing UHC can help ensure that all citizens have access to essential healthcare services without any financial burden. Under UHC, the government or an insurance provider covers the costs of healthcare expenses for all eligible citizens.
2. Public Health Insurance Schemes: India has several public health insurance schemes, such as the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) and the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), which provide health insurance coverage to below poverty line (BPL) families. Expanding these schemes to cover more people, especially those in rural areas, can help bridge the gap in healthcare access.
3. Community Health Centers (CHCs): Establishing and upgrading CHCs in underserved areas can help provide accessible and affordable healthcare services to all citizens, including those living below the poverty line. These centers should be equipped with basic medical infrastructure and staffed with trained healthcare professionals.
4. Telemedicine Services: Leveraging telemedicine services can help reach out to remote areas and provide healthcare consultations to people who may not have access to healthcare facilities due to geographical constraints. This can be particularly useful for BPL families living in rural areas.
5. Mobile Health Clinics: Organizing mobile health clinics that travel to remote areas and provide basic healthcare services can help reach out to people who do not have access to healthcare facilities. These clinics can be staffed with trained healthcare professionals and equipped with essential medical supplies.
6. Public Education Campaigns: Launching public education campaigns can help raise awareness about the importance of healthcare, especially among BPL families. These campaigns can focus on promoting healthy behaviors, early detection of diseases, and seeking timely medical care.
7. Collaboration with NGOs
