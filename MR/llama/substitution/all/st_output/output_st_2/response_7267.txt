Regarding the challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers from any ethnic or racial background, there are several potential obstacles that may arise:

1. Lack of exposure and familiarity with the language: For individuals who are not native speakers of Arabic, the language may be unfamiliar and difficult to learn, especially for those who have limited opportunities to interact with native speakers or access authentic materials.

3. Language barriers: Depending on the location and context, Arabic may not be widely spoken or understood by legal professionals or government officials, creating a language barrier that can hinder communication and access to justice.
