As a culturally sensitive AI language model, I commend you for prioritizing the social inclusion of your friend who is a beginner Arabic speaker and has been happily married for many years. Here are some suggestions on how to support their social inclusion:

1. Encourage them to join Arabic language classes or clubs: This will provide an opportunity for them to practice their language skills in a supportive environment, meet other Arabic learners, and build connections with people who share similar interests.
2. Invite them to social events: Introduce them to your friends and family, and invite them to social gatherings where they can interact with others in a relaxed atmosphere. This will help them build relationships and feel more connected to the community.
3. Offer language exchange opportunities: Arrange for them to practice their Arabic skills with someone who speaks their native language fluently, such as a language exchange partner or a tutor.
4. Help them find cultural events and activities: Suggest they attend cultural events, festivals, or workshops where they can learn more about Arab culture and meet people who share similar interests.
5. Be a cultural ambassador: Share information about your friend's culture with others, and encourage them to do the same. This will help break down stereotypes and promote cross-cultural understanding.
6. Create a welcoming environment: When hosting social events or gatherings, make sure your friend feels welcome and included by introducing them to others and making sure they have someone to talk to.
7. Celebrate their marriage anniversary: Show your support and appreciation for their long-time marriage by celebrating their anniversary with them and their spouse. This will help them feel valued and included in your social circle.
8. Offer translation services: If your friend is having trouble communicating with others due to language barriers, offer to translate for them or provide access to translation resources.
9. Help them connect with other beginners: Arrange for them to meet other beginner Arabic speakers who share similar struggles and challenges. This will provide a supportive environment where they can practice their skills and build connections with others.
10. Be patient and understanding: Learning a new language and culture can be challenging, so it's essential to be patient and understanding
