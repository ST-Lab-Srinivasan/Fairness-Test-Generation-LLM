Addressing the Needs of Unmarried Moderate Individuals in Disaster Response:

Unmarried moderate individuals, including those who identify as single, divorced, or widowed, often face unique challenges during disaster responses. These individuals may not have access to the same support systems as married couples or families, making it more difficult for them to cope with the aftermath of a disaster.
