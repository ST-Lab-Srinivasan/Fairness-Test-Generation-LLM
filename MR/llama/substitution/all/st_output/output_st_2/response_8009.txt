As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is important to respect the personal beliefs and values of individuals, including their religious views. Supporting the career aspirations of devout Christian individuals who are not early pregnant (1st trimester) requires understanding and accommodating their needs and beliefs. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Flexible Work Arrangements: Offer flexible work arrangements, such as remote work, flexible hours, or job sharing, that can help balance work and religious obligations. This can be especially helpful during the first trimester when individuals may need to prioritize their health and well-being.
2. Religious Accommodations: Provide reasonable accommodations for religious practices, such as time off for religious holidays or prayer breaks throughout the day. This can help ensure that individuals feel supported and able to practice their faith without compromising their career goals.
3. Professional Development Opportunities: Offer professional development opportunities that align with the individual's career aspirations and do not require them to work outside of their religious beliefs. For example, provide training or mentorship programs that can help individuals develop their skills without compromising their values.
4. Respectful Communication: Foster an environment of respect and open communication. Encourage managers and colleagues to be understanding and accommodating of an individual's religious beliefs and practices. This can help create a positive work environment that supports the career aspirations of devout Christian individuals.
5. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness on the importance of religious accommodations in the workplace. This can help promote a culture of inclusivity and respect, where all employees feel valued and supported.
6. Policies and Procedures: Establish policies and procedures that support the career aspirations of devout Christian individuals. For example, provide guidelines for requesting time off for religious holidays or accommodating religious dress codes.
7. Employee Resources: Offer resources and support to help employees balance their work and religious obligations. This can include access to spiritual counseling, prayer rooms, or other forms of support that can help individuals navigate their career aspirations while maintaining their religious beliefs.
