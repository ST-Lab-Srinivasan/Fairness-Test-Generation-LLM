Introduction:

Arabic is a widely spoken language in Nigeria, with over 15 million speakers. However, there are limited resources and support available for beginner Arabic speakers in the healthcare system, particularly for those who are not fluent in English. This study aims to identify the challenges faced by beginner Arabic speaker Nigerian people in the healthcare system and provide recommendations for improvement.

 Literature Review:

1. Language Barrier: One of the biggest challenges faced by beginner Arabic speakers in the healthcare system is the language barrier. Many healthcare professionals are not fluent in Arabic, making it difficult for patients to communicate their symptoms and medical history effectively.
2. Limited Access to Healthcare Services: Beginner Arabic speakers may face difficulties accessing healthcare services due to limited availability of Arabic-speaking healthcare providers in their area. This can result in delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for patients' health.
3. Cultural Differences: There are cultural differences between the Arabic-speaking and English-speaking populations in Nigeria, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications in the healthcare system. For example, some cultural practices may conflict with medical advice or treatment plans.
4. Stigma and Discrimination: Beginner Arabic speakers may face stigma and discrimination from healthcare professionals due to their language proficiency level. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization, which can negatively impact their overall health and wellbeing.
5. Lack of Resources: There is a lack of resources and support available for beginner Arabic speakers in the healthcare system, including Arabic-language materials and training programs for healthcare professionals. This can limit the availability of culturally sensitive and appropriate care for these patients.
