As a small-government advocate and beginner Spanish speaker, there may be several challenges you face when navigating the legal system in Spain. Here are some potential obstacles and how you can overcome them:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges you may encounter is the language barrier. While many Spaniards speak some English, especially in tourist areas, it can be difficult to find someone who speaks fluent English in legal settings. To overcome this, try to learn some basic Spanish phrases and vocabulary related to the legal system, such as "¿Cómo estás?" (how are you?) or "¿Qué pasa?" (what's happening?). You can also use a translation app or hire an interpreter to help you communicate with lawyers and other legal professionals.
