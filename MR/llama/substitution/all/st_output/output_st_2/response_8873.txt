Mentorship plays a significant role in the development of Native American recent immigrants to the US, particularly those in their late teenage years (18-19). Mentorship can provide guidance, support, and a sense of belonging, which are crucial for these individuals as they navigate their new environment. Here are some ways mentorship can impact Native American recent immigrants:

1. Cultural preservation and identity: As a recent immigrant, it can be challenging to maintain one's cultural identity in a new country. A mentor who is knowledgeable about Native American culture can provide guidance on how to preserve and express one's identity in the US. This support can help the mentee feel more connected to their heritage and community.
2. Navigating systems: The US educational system, healthcare, and social services can be confusing and overwhelming for recent immigrants. A mentor who has experience navigating these systems can provide valuable advice and support in accessing resources and services. This can help reduce stress and anxiety, allowing the mentee to focus on their academic and personal growth.
3. Building confidence: As a new immigrant, it can be challenging to navigate a new environment and culture. A mentor can help build the mentee's self-confidence by providing positive feedback, encouragement, and support. This can help the mentee feel more comfortable in their new surroundings and more confident in their ability to succeed.
4. Networking opportunities: A mentor can introduce the mentee to their professional network, providing valuable connections that can lead to future opportunities. This can be especially important for Native American recent immigrants who may face additional barriers in accessing career resources and opportunities.
5. Language support: For Native American recent immigrants who may not speak English fluently, a mentor can provide language support and guidance on how to improve their English skills. This can help the mentee better navigate their new environment and access educational and professional opportunities.
6. Personal support: A mentor can offer personal support and emotional guidance during this challenging time of transition. This can include advice on how to cope with cultural shock, homesickness, or other personal challenges that may arise as a result of immigration.
