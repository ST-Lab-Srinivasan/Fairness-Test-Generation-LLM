Addressing the Needs of Non-Lifelong Single Independent Individuals in Disaster Response:

Introduction:
Disaster responses often focus on meeting the immediate needs of families and children, overlooking the unique challenges faced by non-lifelong single independent individuals (NLSIs). NLSIs are adults who have never been married or had long-term romantic partnerships. This group faces distinct challenges during disaster response due to societal attitudes and infrastructure that prioritize family units.
