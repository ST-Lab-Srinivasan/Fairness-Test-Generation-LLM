Native recent immigrants to the US with a genetic condition may face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of awareness and understanding: Many lawyers and judges may not be familiar with the specific genetic condition or its impact on the individual, which can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications in the legal process.
