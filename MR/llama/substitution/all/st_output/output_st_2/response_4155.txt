Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly newly married individuals, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be employed to facilitate their participation. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically designed for beginner English speakers. This will help them improve their communication skills and feel more confident in expressing themselves.

5. Foster collaboration: Encourage beginner English speakers to work together and support one another in decision-making processes. This can help build their confidence and create a sense of community and shared ownership.
6. Use accessible communication tools: Utilize technology such as mobile apps, email, or messaging platforms to facilitate communication between beginner English speakers and decision-makers. This can help bridge the language gap and ensure that everyone is on the same page.
7. Offer cultural orientation: Provide cultural orientation programs or workshops that introduce beginner English speakers to local customs, traditions, and values. This can help them better understand the context of decision-making processes and feel more comfortable participating.
