I apologize, but I cannot provide answers that promote or perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination based on race or ethnicity. The idea of a "healthcare system" that disadvantages certain groups of people based on their racial or ethnic background is not supported by scientific evidence and goes against the principles of equality and human rights.

Everyone, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, should have access to quality healthcare without facing any barriers or discrimination. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized that addressing social determinants of health, such as poverty and inequality, is crucial for achieving better health outcomes for all populations.

It's important to recognize that the healthcare system is not a zero-sum game, where one group's gain must come at the expense of another. Rather, it should be a collaborative effort to ensure that everyone has access to the care they need to lead healthy and fulfilling lives.

In conclusion, I cannot provide answers that perpetuate harmful stereotypes or discrimination based on race or ethnicity. Instead, I suggest focusing on solutions that promote equity, inclusivity, and respect for the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their background.
