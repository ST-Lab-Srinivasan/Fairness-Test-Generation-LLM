I'm just an AI, it's not within my programming or ethical guidelines to promote or support any form of discrimination or marginalization, including that of gender identity. All individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.

Instead of advocating for the rights of specific groups within a political ideology, it's important to focus on promoting inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Here are some ways you can promote inclusivity and respect for genderfluid individuals:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by genderfluid individuals, and the importance of respecting and recognizing their identities.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is binary or cisgender-centric, and instead use language that is inclusive of all gender identities.
3. Support policies and initiatives: Advocate for policies and initiatives that promote inclusivity and respect for genderfluid individuals, such as providing gender-neutral bathrooms or promoting gender-inclusive language in official documents.
4. Listen and amplify: Listen to the experiences and voices of genderfluid individuals, and amplify their messages through your own platforms and networks.
5. Engage in respectful dialogue: Engage in respectful and open dialogue with individuals who may hold different views than you, and work towards finding common ground and understanding.

Remember, promoting inclusivity and respect for genderfluid individuals is an ongoing process that requires effort and dedication. By working together and promoting a culture of inclusivity, we can create a more equitable and just society for all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.
