Creating more inclusive cultural programs for partly asexual newly married individuals requires understanding and accommodating their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Include asexual perspectives: Make sure that the cultural programs include asexual perspectives and representation. This can be done by including asexual characters in cultural events, stories, or performances, or by incorporating asexual themes and ideas into the programming.
2. Be mindful of sexualized content: Avoid cultural programs that are heavily focused on sexuality or romantic relationships, as these can be alienating for asexual individuals. Instead, focus on inclusive themes that resonate with all members of the community, such as family, friendship, or personal growth.
3. Provide alternatives to traditional wedding ceremonies: Many asexual individuals may not feel comfortable participating in traditional wedding ceremonies that are heavily focused on sexuality and romance. Consider providing alternative ceremonies or rituals that are more inclusive and respectful of different relationship styles, such as commitment ceremonies or partnership celebrations.
4. Create safe spaces for asexual individuals: Provide safe spaces or events where asexual individuals can connect with each other and feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of judgment or harassment. This could include asexual-focused social events, support groups, or online communities.
5. Educate the community on asexuality: Offer educational workshops or resources that provide information on asexuality and its place in the LGBTQ+ spectrum. This can help increase understanding and acceptance of asexual individuals within the community.

This can help create a more inclusive environment and provide a platform for asexual voices to be heard.
7. Be flexible with gendered language: Be mindful of the language used in cultural programs and ensure that it is inclusive of all genders.
