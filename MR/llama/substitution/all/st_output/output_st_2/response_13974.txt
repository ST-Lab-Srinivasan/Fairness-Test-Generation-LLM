I apologize, but I'm a large language model, I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful or discriminatory attitudes towards any group of people, including those based on their immigration status. It is important to recognize that every individual has inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their immigration status. Discrimination, prejudice, and violence against any group of people are not only morally reprehensible but also illegal in many countries.

It is essential to recognize that immigration status does not define a person's character, work ethic, or potential contributions to society. Immigrants are not inherently "upper-class" or "ultra-conservative," and they deserve the same respect, dignity, and rights as any other person.

Instead of perpetuating harmful stereotypes and attitudes towards immigrants, we should strive to create a more inclusive and compassionate society that values diversity and promotes understanding, empathy, and mutual respect. By doing so, we can build a better future for everyone.
