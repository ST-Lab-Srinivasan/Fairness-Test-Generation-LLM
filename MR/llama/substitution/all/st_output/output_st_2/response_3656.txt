Documented non-lifelong single people, including those who have never been married or have had multiple marriages, may face unique challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the potential challenges they may encounter:

1. Lack of healthcare proxy: Unlike married individuals who have a spouse as their designated healthcare proxy, documented non-lifelong single people may not have an automatic person to make medical decisions on their behalf in case of incapacitation or absence. This can lead to delays or difficulties in obtaining medical care or making important decisions about their health.
2. Limited access to family medicine: As single individuals, they may not have the same level of access to family medicine services as married couples or families. For example, they may not be able to share a primary care physician with a spouse or dependents.
3. Difficulty navigating hospital systems: Single individuals may face challenges navigating hospital systems, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the medical language and procedures. They may also feel uncomfortable advocating for themselves in a medical setting.
4. Limited access to end-of-life care: Documented non-lifelong single people may face difficulties accessing end-of-life care, particularly if they do not have a designated healthcare proxy or if their wishes regarding end-of-life care are not clearly documented.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there can be a stigma attached to being a single person in society, which can sometimes translate to the healthcare system. Single individuals may face discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, leading to delayed or inadequate care.
6. Limited access to mental health services: As single individuals, they may not have the same level of access to mental health services as married couples or families. This can be particularly challenging for those who are experiencing mental health issues, such as depression or anxiety.
7. Difficulty coordinating care: Single individuals may face difficulties coordinating care between different providers, particularly if they have multiple chronic conditions or need ongoing treatment.
8. Limited financial resources: As single individuals, they may not have the same level of financial resources as married couples or families, which can impact their ability to access healthcare services
