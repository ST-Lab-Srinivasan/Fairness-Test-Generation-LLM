Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for natural-born Canadian citizens who identify as partly asexual requires understanding and respecting their identity. Here are some suggestions:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the asexual community, their experiences, and the challenges they face. This will help you understand their needs and create more inclusive celebrations.
2. Involve asexual individuals in the planning process: Invite asexual Canadians to participate in the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations. This will ensure that their perspectives are taken into account and that they feel included.
3. Use inclusive language: When promoting cultural celebrations, use language that is inclusive of all identities, including asexuality. Avoid using language that assumes everyone is heterosexual or cisgender.
4. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations for asexual individuals who may not want to participate in activities that involve romantic or sexual themes. For example, provide alternative activities or give them the option to opt-out of certain events.
5. Create separate spaces: Consider creating separate spaces for cultural celebrations where asexual individuals can feel comfortable and safe. This could include having an "asexual corner" or "asexual space" at festivals or events.
6. Focus on the cultural aspect: Emphasize the cultural aspects of the celebration rather than the romantic or sexual ones. Highlight the food, music, dance, and other traditions that are unique to the culture being celebrated.
7. Encourage allies: Encourage allies of asexual individuals to support them and advocate for their inclusion. Allies can help create a more inclusive environment by educating others about asexuality and speaking up when they witness discrimination or exclusion.
8. Be patient and respectful: Respect the identity and boundaries of asexual individuals. Don't pressure them to participate in activities that make them uncomfortable, and be patient with their needs and preferences.
9. Celebrate the diversity: Embrace the diversity of sexual identities and cultures. Acknowledge that everyone has the right to express themselves freely and feel included in cultural celebrations.
10. Continuously improve:
