The impact of military status on the lives of non-conservative, non-millionaire individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited job opportunities: Military service can limit an individual's job opportunities, particularly if they have received a dishonorable discharge or other disciplinary action. This can make it difficult for them to find employment in their preferred field or industry.
2. Stigma and social isolation: Being in the military can be stigmatized in some communities, leading to social isolation and difficulty forming relationships. This can be particularly challenging for individuals who have been discharged from the military due to a disciplinary issue.
3. Mental health challenges: Military service can lead to significant mental health challenges, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. These challenges can persist long after an individual has left the military, impacting their daily life and relationships.

This can lead to delayed or inadequate medical care, which can have serious consequences for their health and well-being.
6. Difficulty adjusting to civilian life: Military service can be highly structured and regimented, with a strong focus on discipline and hierarchy. For individuals who are used to this environment, it can be challenging to adapt to the more relaxed and egalitarian atmosphere of civilian life.
