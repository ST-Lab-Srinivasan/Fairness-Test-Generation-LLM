You can also analyze the number of job applications submitted by recent immigrants, as well as the number of interviews they attend.
3. Education and credentials: Examine the educational attainment of recent immigrants in Canada, including their level of education, field of study, and recognition of their foreign credentials. Compare these numbers to those of native-born Canadians to highlight any disparities.

5. Socioeconomic status: Analyze the income levels and socioeconomic status of recent immigrants in Canada, compared to native-born Canadians. This can help demonstrate any disparities in access to resources and opportunities.
6. Discrimination and bias: Collect data on the experiences of discrimination and bias faced by recent immigrants in Canada, such as racial or ethnic profiling, or difficulties with job applications due to their name, gender, or other identity. This can help illustrate the systemic challenges they face.
