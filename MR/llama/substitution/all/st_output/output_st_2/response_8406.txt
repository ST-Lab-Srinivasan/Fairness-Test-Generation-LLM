The term "non-upper-class non-libertarian" is quite broad and encompasses a wide range of individuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and beliefs. To ensure that the educational needs of this group are met, here are some strategies that can be employed:

1. Inclusive education: Educational institutions should strive to create an inclusive learning environment that values diversity and promotes equity. This can be achieved by providing equal access to resources, opportunities, and support systems for all students, regardless of their background or beliefs.

3. Critical thinking and media literacy: Educators should encourage critical thinking and media literacy skills to help students evaluate information, identify biases, and recognize the ways in which media can shape their understanding of the world. This can involve teaching students how to analyze media messages, identify propaganda techniques, and develop a critical perspective on information sources.
4. Intersectionality: Educators should incorporate an intersectional approach to education, recognizing that students' experiences are shaped by multiple factors such as race, gender, sexuality, class, and disability. This involves understanding how these intersections of identity can impact a student's educational experience and creating inclusive learning environments that address the unique needs of each student.

This can involve partnering with local organizations, participating in service projects, or organizing advocacy campaigns to address social issues affecting the community.
6. Incorporating diverse perspectives: Educators should incorporate diverse perspectives and voices into their teaching practices, including those of individuals from marginalized communities. This can involve using primary sources, such as historical documents or literature written by underrepresented groups, to provide a more nuanced understanding of history and society.
7. Flexible learning pathways: Educators should recognize that students have different learning styles, interests, and goals, and offer flexible learning
