Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for immigrant natural-born US citizens who are strong atheists requires recognizing and respecting their beliefs and values. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand and appreciate the diversity of cultural practices: Acknowledge that cultural celebrations are not just about religion, but also include secular traditions and customs. Be open to learning about and participating in a variety of cultural practices, even if they do not align with your own beliefs.
2. Involve atheist representatives: Invite atheist representatives from various communities to participate in planning and decision-making processes for cultural celebrations. This will ensure that their perspectives are taken into account and that they feel included.
3. Provide alternative ways to participate: Offer non-religious alternatives for participation in cultural celebrations, such as volunteering, donating, or simply attending events. This will allow atheists to contribute without feeling excluded or uncomfortable.
4. Create inclusive spaces: Make sure that cultural celebrations are accessible and welcoming to all, regardless of their beliefs. Provide clear information about the event, including any religious elements, and make sure there are alternative activities for those who do not wish to participate in religious aspects.
5. Encourage respectful dialogue: Foster a culture of mutual respect and understanding between people of different belief systems. Encourage open and honest communication, and create opportunities for dialogue and learning.
6. Offer educational resources: Provide information and resources that educate atheists about the cultural celebrations they are participating in, as well as provide information about their own cultural heritage. This can help to promote understanding and appreciation of different beliefs and practices.
7. Be mindful of language and terminology: Use inclusive language and avoid using terms that may be offensive or alienating to atheists. Avoid assuming that everyone shares the same religious beliefs, and instead focus on creating a welcoming and respectful environment for all.
8. Engage in active listening: Listen actively to the concerns and suggestions of atheist individuals and communities, and make sure to incorporate their perspectives into planning and decision-making processes.
9. Be willing to adapt and compromise
