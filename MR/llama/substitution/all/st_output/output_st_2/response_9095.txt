Temporary visa holders, including those on work, study, or visitor visas, often face significant barriers when accessing healthcare in Australia. Here are some of the challenges they may encounter:

1. Lack of access to Medicare: Temporary visa holders are not eligible for Medicare, which means they cannot receive free or low-cost medical treatment under the Australian public health system. They may have to pay full price for medical services, which can be a significant burden for those on lower incomes.
