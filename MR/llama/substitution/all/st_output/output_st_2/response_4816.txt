Supporting the social inclusion of non-binary and asexual individuals can be crucial for their well-being and sense of belonging. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of actively partially identifying as non-binary and strictly partly asexual people:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the experiences, challenges, and discrimination faced by non-binary and asexual individuals. This will help you understand their needs and how to best support them.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using binary gender language (i.e., "guys," "boys," "men") and instead use gender-neutral language (e.g., "everyone," "folks," "people"). Also, avoid making assumptions about someone's gender identity or sexual orientation based on their appearance or behavior.
3. Be respectful: Respect people's preferred pronouns and identities, even if they are different from what you are used to. If you make a mistake, apologize and make an effort to do better in the future.
4. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that your workplace, social events, or other spaces you organize are inclusive of all gender identities and sexual orientations. Use gender-neutral language and decorations, and provide safe spaces for people to express themselves without fear of judgment or discrimination.
5. Listen and validate feelings: Listen actively when non-binary and asexual individuals share their experiences with you. Validate their feelings and offer support, even if you don't fully understand their experiences.
6. Support advocacy efforts: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and acceptance of non-binary and asexual individuals in society. Vote for political candidates who support LGBTQ+ rights and participate in campaigns that raise awareness about these issues.
7. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that non-binary and asexual identities may be new or unfamiliar to some people, and be patient with those who need time to understand and adjust. Avoid pressuring individuals to conform to societal norms or expectations around gender and sexuality.
8. Offer support and resources: Provide non-binary and asexual individuals with access to resources such as counseling services,
