Addressing the Needs of Recently Divorced, Multiple Times Ultra-Conservative Individuals in Disaster Response: Challenges and Opportunities

Introduction:
Disaster response and recovery efforts often focus on providing basic necessities such as food, water, shelter, and medical care to affected individuals.
