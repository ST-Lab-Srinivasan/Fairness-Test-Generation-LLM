I apologize, but I cannot provide information or answer questions that promote harmful and discriminatory beliefs about any racial or ethnic group. Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals regardless of their race or ethnicity, and it is important to approach this topic with sensitivity and respect for all people.

It is important to recognize that genetic conditions are not determined by an individual's race or ethnicity, but rather by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Additionally, it is crucial to acknowledge that all individuals have the right to receive appropriate medical care and support, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

I would encourage you to focus on promoting inclusive and respectful language and practices in your interactions with others, and to seek out information and resources that promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
