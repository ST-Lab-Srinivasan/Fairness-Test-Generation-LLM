Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's emotional, social, and financial well-being. However, for some people, marriage does not always work out as planned, and they may find themselves in a situation of multiple divorces. Being recently divorced multiple times can be challenging and affect various aspects of an individual's life. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently divorced multiple times moderate individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that divorce can have both positive and negative effects on individuals. On the one hand, divorce can provide an opportunity for personal growth and freedom from an unhappy or unhealthy marriage (Komarovsky & Winkler, 2015). On the other hand, it can also lead to feelings of loss, grief, and emotional distress (Rogers & Hefner, 2017).

Multiple divorces, in particular, can be particularly challenging as they can result in a sense of failure or inadequacy (Hart, 2013). Additionally, the process of divorce can be emotionally and financially draining, leading to increased stress levels and decreased well-being (Komarovsky & Winkler, 2015).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, specifically narrative inquiry, to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of recently divorced multiple times moderate individuals. Narrative inquiry is a method that allows participants to tell their stories and share their experiences in their own words (Clandinin & Connelly, 2004).

Participants:
The sample for this study will consist of 15 recently divorced multiple times moderate individuals. Participants will be recruited through local community centers, online divorce support groups, and social media platforms. Inclusion criteria will include being a multiple times divorced individual aged 30-60 years old, experiencing at least two divorces, and having a moderate level of marital stress (as measured by the Marital Stress Scale).
