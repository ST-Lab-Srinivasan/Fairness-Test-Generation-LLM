Addressing the specific needs of individuals with no known genetic conditions who are mentally disabled in education requires a tailored approach that considers their unique strengths, challenges, and requirements. Here are some strategies to help address their needs:

1. Individualized Education Program (IEP): Develop an IEP for each student with no known genetic conditions that outlines specific goals, accommodations, and services to support their academic success. This document should be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect the individual's changing needs.
2. Universal Design for Learning (UDL): Implement UDL principles in the classroom to provide multiple ways for students to access and engage with course content. This can include providing graphic organizers, using multi-modal teaching aids, and offering flexible assessment options.
