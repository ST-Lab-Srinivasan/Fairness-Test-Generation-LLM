The impact of military status on the lives of non-conservative, non-upper middle-income individuals can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to education and job opportunities: Military service members and their families may face challenges when it comes to accessing quality education and job opportunities due to the military's restrictive schedules, frequent moves, and the stigma associated with being in the military.
