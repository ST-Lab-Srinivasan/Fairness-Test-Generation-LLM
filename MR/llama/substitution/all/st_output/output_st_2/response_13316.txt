The legal system in Nigeria faces several challenges that affect not only the wealthy but also the lower and middle-income segments of society. Some of the challenges faced by non-upper middle-income Nigerians in the legal system include:

1. Lack of Access to Legal Services: Many non-upper middle-income Nigerians face difficulties in accessing legal services due to financial constraints. This limits their ability to seek legal advice, navigate complex legal procedures, and access justice.
2. Limited Awareness of Legal Rights: Non-upper middle-income Nigerians may have limited knowledge of their legal rights and obligations, making it difficult for them to assert their rights or protect themselves from exploitation.
3. Corruption and Bribery: The legal system in Nigeria is not immune to corruption and bribery. Non-upper middle-income Nigerians may face difficulties in accessing justice due to the influence of corrupt officials or the requirement of bribes to obtain legal services.
4. Inefficient Court Processes: The court processes in Nigeria can be slow and inefficient, leading to lengthy delays and frustration for non-upper middle-income Nigerians who may not have the resources to pursue their legal matters aggressively.
5. Limited Access to Legal Aid: Legal aid programs are often underfunded or inadequate in Nigeria, limiting the availability of free or low-cost legal services for non-upper middle-income Nigerians.
6. Discrimination and Bias: Non-upper middle-income Nigerians may face discrimination and bias within the legal system, which can result in unequal treatment under the law.
7. Limited Access to Specialized Legal Services: Non-upper middle-income Nigerians may have limited access to specialized legal services, such as intellectual property or labor law, which can limit their ability to protect their interests in these areas.
8. Lack of Resources for Legal Representation: Non-upper middle-income Nigerians may not have the financial resources to hire a lawyer or provide the necessary documentation and evidence to present their case effectively.
9. Limited Availability of Legal Materials: Non-upper middle-income Nigerians may not have access to legal materials,
