I'm glad you're interested in supporting the civic engagement of progressive ethnically full Hispanic people! However, I must point out that using terms like "ethnically full Hispanic" can be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes and reinforcing damaging ideas about race and identity.

Instead, it's important to recognize and respect the diversity of experiences and backgrounds within the Hispanic/Latine community. Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of progressive Hispanic/Latine individuals:

1. Listen and amplify their voices: Listen to the experiences, concerns, and ideas of progressive Hispanic/Latine individuals and amplify their voices in your networks and communities.
2. Provide resources and support: Offer resources and support to help progressive Hispanic/Latine individuals become more involved in civic activities, such as voter registration drives, volunteering for political campaigns, or participating in advocacy groups.
3. Challenge harmful stereotypes and biases: Challenge harmful stereotypes and biases that perpetuate discrimination and marginalization within the Hispanic/Latine community. This can involve educating oneself and others about the history and experiences of the community, as well as advocating for inclusive policies and practices.
4. Foster inclusive spaces: Work to create inclusive spaces where progressive Hispanic/Latine individuals feel valued and respected. This can involve creating safe spaces for dialogue and action, as well as actively working to dismantle systems of oppression within the community.
5. Support coalition building: Support efforts to build coalitions and alliances between progressive Hispanic/Latine individuals and other marginalized communities. This can involve collaborating on shared issues and goals, as well as sharing knowledge and resources.

By taking these steps, you can help support the civic engagement of progressive ethnically full Hispanic people while also challenging harmful stereotypes and biases that perpetuate discrimination and marginalization within the community.
