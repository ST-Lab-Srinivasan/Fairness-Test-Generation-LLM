Ensuring the educational needs of Mandarin-speaking students who have been divorced multiple times can be challenging, but there are several strategies that teachers and educators can use to support these students. Here are some possible approaches:

1. Cultural sensitivity: Teachers should be aware of the cultural differences and nuances of the Mandarin-speaking community, particularly when it comes to family dynamics.
