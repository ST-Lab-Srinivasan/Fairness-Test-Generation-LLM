Supporting the economic empowerment of low-income immigrants in the US requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Access to Financial Services: Many immigrants lack access to traditional banking services, which makes it difficult for them to save money, apply for loans, or start a business.
