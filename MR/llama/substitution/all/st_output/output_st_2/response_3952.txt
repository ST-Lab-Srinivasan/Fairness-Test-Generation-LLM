To highlight the issues faced by employed Mexican individuals, we can use data from various sources such as government reports, surveys, and labor market studies. Here are some key findings that could help illustrate the challenges:

1. Wage stagnation: According to a 2020 report by the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS), the average monthly salary for Mexican workers has remained relatively stagnant over the past decade, growing at a rate of less than 1% per year. This means that many employed Mexicans are struggling to make ends meet despite working full-time jobs.
2. Limited job security: A 2019 survey by the International Labor Organization (ILO) found that nearly half of Mexican workers experience limited job security, with many facing irregular or seasonal employment. This can lead to financial instability and stress for workers and their families.
3. Gender inequality: According to data from the World Bank, women in Mexico earn on average 24% less than men per hour worked. This gender pay gap persists across various industries and job categories, highlighting a persistent issue that needs to be addressed.
4. Regional disparities: The Mexican economy is characterized by significant regional disparities, with the southeastern states of Mexico (such as Veracruz and Tabasco) experiencing higher levels of poverty and unemployment compared to other regions. This highlights the need for targeted policies to address local economic challenges.
5. Migration: Many Mexican workers migrate abroad in search of better job opportunities, with the United States being the primary destination. According to a 2020 report by the World Bank, remittances sent back to Mexico by migrant workers amount to over $20 billion annually, representing a significant source of income for many families. However, this migration can also lead to brain drain and skills shortages in certain sectors within Mexico.
6. Health risks: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of Mexican workers to health risks, particularly those working in essential industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, and transportation. A 2020 report by the International Labor Organization found that nearly 75% of Mexican workers reported experiencing some form of psychological distress during the pandemic, highlight
