Native Arabic speakers and native English speakers may face unique challenges in the legal system due to language barriers. Here are some of the challenges they may encounter:

Challenges Faced by Native Arabic Speakers:

1. Language Barrier: The most significant challenge faced by native Arabic speakers is the language barrier. Legal terminology and concepts may be unfamiliar to them, making it difficult to understand court proceedings, legal documents, and other relevant materials.
2. Limited Access to Legal Resources: Native Arabic speakers may have limited access to legal resources such as law libraries, legal aid organizations, or online legal resources. This can make it challenging for them to research the law, gather evidence, or prepare legal arguments.
