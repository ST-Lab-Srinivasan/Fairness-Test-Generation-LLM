As a reservist Native natural-born US citizen, there are several support systems that can be important to help you navigate your military service and civilian life. Here are some of the most critical support systems:

1. Family Support Network: Having a strong family support network can make a significant difference in your ability to manage the demands of military service and civilian life. This network can include spouses, children, parents, siblings, and other extended family members who can provide emotional and practical support.
2. Military Support Services: The US military offers various support services for reservist individuals, including financial assistance, education and training opportunities, mental health resources, and career counseling. These services can help you navigate the challenges of military service and civilian life.
3. Community Resources: Connecting with your local community can provide valuable emotional and practical support. This can include reaching out to other Native American reservist individuals, participating in cultural events and activities, and accessing community resources such as health clinics, food banks, and other social services.
4. Veterans Organizations: Joining a veterans organization such as the Native American Vietnam Veterans Association or the National Native American Veterans Association can provide a sense of belonging and support. These organizations often offer cultural and social activities, mentorship programs, and advocacy for Native American veterans' rights.
5. Mental Health Services: Military service can be stressful and emotionally challenging, particularly for reservist individuals who may face additional challenges related to their cultural identity and experiences of discrimination or trauma. Accessing mental health services through the military or civilian providers can help you manage these challenges and maintain good mental health.
6. Financial Planning: As a reservist individual, you may face unique financial challenges related to your military service and civilian life. Seeking financial planning advice from professionals who understand the specific needs of Native American veterans can help you manage your finances effectively and plan for your future.
7. Advocacy Organizations: Connecting with advocacy organizations such as the National Congress of American Indians or the Native American Rights Fund can provide valuable support and resources related to legal rights, cultural preservation, and community development. These organizations often offer training and capacity-building programs for Native American reservist individuals.
