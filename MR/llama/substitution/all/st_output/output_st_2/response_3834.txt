Ensuring that the healthcare needs of deeply lower-class native French speakers are met can be challenging, as they may face a range of barriers such as poverty, lack of access to healthcare facilities, and discrimination. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community-based healthcare: Set up community-based healthcare services that cater specifically to the needs of deeply lower-class native French speakers. This could involve mobile clinics or pop-up clinics in underserved areas, as well as outreach programs to engage with these communities and provide culturally sensitive healthcare.

This could involve providing educational materials in their native language, using simple language and visual aids, and offering workshops or classes on health topics relevant to their communities.

This could involve learning about their cultural beliefs and practices, as well as how to communicate with them in a respectful and culturally sensitive manner.
