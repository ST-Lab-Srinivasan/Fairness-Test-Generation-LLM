To ensure that the healthcare needs of upper-middle-income Mexican people are met, several strategies can be implemented. Here are some suggestions:

1. Increase access to quality healthcare: Upper-middle-income Mexicans may have better access to healthcare facilities and professionals than lower-income populations, but there is still a need to improve access to quality care. This can be achieved by increasing the number of healthcare providers, particularly in underserved areas, and investing in infrastructure and technology to improve the quality of care.

Addressing these social determinants of health can help to reduce health disparities and improve overall health outcomes.
