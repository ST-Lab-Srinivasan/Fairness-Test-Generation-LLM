The impact of marital status on the lives of Mandarin genderqueer individuals can be complex and varied. In Taiwan, where the study was conducted, marriage is legally recognized as a union between a man and a woman, and there are no legal provisions for same-sex marriage or recognition of non-binary genders. This means that Mandarin genderqueer individuals may face unique challenges in their personal and social lives due to societal norms and legal barriers.

Some potential impacts of marital status on the lives of Mandarin genderqueer individuals include:

1. Legal barriers: As mentioned earlier, marriage is only legally recognized between a man and a woman in Taiwan. This means that Mandarin genderqueer individuals may face legal barriers when it comes to accessing rights and benefits that are typically associated with marriage, such as inheritance, tax benefits, or hospital visitation rights.
2. Social stigma: Genderqueer individuals may face social stigma and discrimination based on their marital status. For example, they may be viewed as deviating from societal norms or expectations of gender roles, leading to isolation or marginalization.
3. Family pressure: Mandarin genderqueer individuals may face pressure from their families to conform to traditional gender roles or expectations, particularly if they are raised in a patriarchal and heteronormative environment. This can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, or internalized oppression.
4. Health disparities: Genderqueer individuals may experience health disparities due to lack of access to appropriate healthcare services. For example, they may face barriers in accessing hormone therapy or gender-affirming surgeries, which can have significant impacts on their physical and mental health.
5. Employment discrimination: Mandarin genderqueer individuals may face employment discrimination based on their marital status, particularly if they are working in industries that are dominated by men or if they are in positions of authority. This can lead to limited career advancement opportunities and lower earning potential.
6. Housing instability: Genderqueer individuals may face housing instability due to lack of access to affordable and secure housing options. This can lead to homelessness, overcrowding, or poor living conditions, which can have significant
