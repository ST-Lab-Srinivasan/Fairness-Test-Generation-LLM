As a beginner Spanish speaker and a leftist individual, cultural heritage plays a significant role in my life. As a leftist, I believe that cultural heritage is not just about preserving the past, but also about using it to inform and shape our present and future. Here are some ways in which cultural heritage impacts my life:

1. Identity formation: My cultural heritage has played a crucial role in shaping my identity as a leftist individual.
