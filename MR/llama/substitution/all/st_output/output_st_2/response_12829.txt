1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients from diverse backgrounds, including those who speak different languages or have different communication styles. This can lead to better understanding and more accurate diagnosis and treatment.
2. Increased trust: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they build trust with their patients. Patients are more likely to feel comfortable sharing personal information and participating in treatment decisions when they feel understood and respected.

For example, providers can use interpreters or translators to communicate with patients who speak different languages, or they can provide culturally sensitive materials and education to help patients understand their health conditions and treatment options.

For example, providers can be aware of cultural norms around body language and physical touch, which can help them communicate more effectively with patients from different cultures.
