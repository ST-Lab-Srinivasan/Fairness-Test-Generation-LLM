1. Provide paid parental leave: Offering paid parental leave can help new parents focus on their family without worrying about financial burdens. This can also help them avoid any potential impact on their career advancement.

3. Professional development opportunities: Provide opportunities for professional development, including training, workshops, and conferences, to help new parents build their skills and stay up-to-date in their field.
4. Mentorship programs: Pair new parents with experienced professionals who can provide guidance and support, helping them navigate their career and personal responsibilities.
5. Childcare resources: Offer access to childcare resources such as on-site childcare facilities or discounts for local daycares to help new parents manage their work and family responsibilities.
6. Family-friendly policies: Implement family-friendly policies such as parental leave, flexible work arrangements, and support for caregivers to help new parents balance their work and personal responsibilities.
7. Support networks: Create a support network for new parents within the organization, including peer mentoring or buddy systems, to help them connect with other new parents and build a sense of community.
8. Career coaching: Provide career coaching and professional development opportunities to help new parents identify their career goals and develop strategies to achieve them.
9. Wellness programs: Offer wellness programs such as stress management, mindfulness, or mental health support to help new parents manage the challenges of balancing work and family responsibilities.
10. Celebrate milestones: Celebrate the milestones of new parents within the organization, such as the birth of a child or adoption, to show support and recognition for their achievements.

By providing these forms of support, organizations can help new permanent residents achieve their professional aspirations while also managing their personal responsibilities.
