The challenges faced by advanced French speakers over the age of 90 or older in the healthcare system include:

1. Language barriers: Even if they are native French speakers, their language skills may be affected by aging, leading to difficulties in communicating with healthcare providers, particularly if they have a different accent or dialect.
2. Hearing and vision problems: Many older adults experience hearing and vision loss, which can make it harder for them to understand medical instructions, fill out forms, or read medication labels.
3. Cognitive decline: As people age, their cognitive abilities may decline, including memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. This can affect their ability to manage their health and navigate the healthcare system.
4. Limited mobility: Older adults may have difficulty moving around, which can make it harder for them to access medical care or complete paperwork.
5. Social isolation: Many older adults experience social isolation, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression. This can also affect their motivation to manage their health and seek medical care when needed.
6. Cultural barriers: Advanced French speakers may have cultural backgrounds or beliefs that affect their perceptions of healthcare and their willingness to seek medical care. For example, some cultures may place a greater emphasis on traditional healing practices than Western medicine.
7. Lack of transportation: Older adults may not have access to reliable transportation, which can make it harder for them to get to medical appointments or run errands related to their care.
8. Limited access to healthcare providers: Advanced French speakers may live in areas with limited access to healthcare providers who speak their language fluently. This can make it harder for them to find care that meets their needs.
9. Discrimination: Older adults from diverse backgrounds may experience discrimination in the healthcare system, which can affect their access to care and their overall well-being.
