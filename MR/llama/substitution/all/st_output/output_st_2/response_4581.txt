Creating more inclusive social policies for non-disabled individuals is essential for promoting equality and reducing discrimination. Here are some strategies that can help create a more inclusive society:

1. Inclusive language: Use inclusive language in all communication, including policy documents, speeches, and media releases. Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes any particular group, such as "people with disabilities" instead use "disabled individuals."
2. Representation matters: Ensure that the voices of non-disabled individuals are represented in decision-making processes and policies. This can be achieved by involving them in consultations, focus groups, and advisory boards.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that public spaces, buildings, and services are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair ramps, Braille signage, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
4. Education and awareness: Educate the public about disability issues and promote awareness about the experiences and challenges faced by disabled individuals. This can be achieved through workshops, seminars, and media campaigns.
5. Employment opportunities: Provide equal employment opportunities for non-disabled individuals and ensure that they are not discriminated against based on their abilities. Offer reasonable accommodations and support employees with disabilities in the workplace.
6. Healthcare accessibility: Ensure that healthcare services are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. Provide accessible waiting areas, examination rooms, and medical equipment for patients with mobility or sensory impairments.
7. Social protection: Develop policies that protect the rights of non-disabled individuals and provide them with the same level of social support as disabled individuals. This can include access to housing, education, and employment opportunities.
8. Inclusive transportation: Ensure that public transportation is accessible to all individuals, including those with mobility or sensory impairments. Provide accessible buses, trains, and subways, and ensure that drivers are trained in disability awareness.
9. Community engagement: Encourage community engagement and participation of non-disabled individuals in disabled-led organizations and initiatives. This can help build bridges between different communities
