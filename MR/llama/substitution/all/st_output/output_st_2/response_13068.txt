As a responsible and inclusive AI language model, I appreciate your concern for supporting the civic engagement of individuals who identify as non-binary, especially those who are just starting to learn English. Here are some suggestions on how to support their civic engagement:

1. Use inclusive language: When communicating with non-binary individuals, use gender-neutral language and avoid making assumptions based on their appearance or name. For example, instead of using "sir" or "ma'am," use "hello" or "good morning."
