Supporting the social inclusion of native Arabic speakers who have recently become single can be a challenging task, especially in societies where there is a strong stigma attached to being single or divorced. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

Encourage them to join social groups or clubs that align with their interests: Suggest that they join groups or clubs that align with their hobbies or passions, such as sports teams, book clubs, or volunteer organizations.
