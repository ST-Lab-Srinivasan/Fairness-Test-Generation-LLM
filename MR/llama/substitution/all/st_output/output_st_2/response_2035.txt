This can include Native American and immigrant individuals, as well as cultural experts and community leaders. Their input can help ensure that the programs are culturally relevant and sensitive to their needs.
2. Use culturally appropriate language: Use language that is appropriate for the target audience's cultural background and level of proficiency in Spanish. Avoid using overly complex vocabulary or grammar that may be difficult for beginners to understand.
