Ensuring that the voices of native Spanish speakers, particularly those from ethnically full Hispanic backgrounds, are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting diversity and inclusivity. Here are some strategies to achieve this:

1. Representation: Ensure that individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds are represented in decision-making bodies, such as boards of directors, government agencies, and community organizations. This can be achieved by actively seeking out and appointing individuals who reflect the diversity of the community.
2. Empowerment: Provide opportunities for individuals from underrepresented groups to develop leadership skills and take on leadership roles. This can involve providing training, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
3. Inclusive decision-making processes: Design decision-making processes that are inclusive and take into account the perspectives of all stakeholders, including individuals from ethnically full Hispanic backgrounds. This can involve using techniques such as consensus-building, participatory budgeting, and community-based decision-making.
4. Community engagement: Engage with communities and involve them in decision-making processes through mechanisms such as community meetings, public hearings, and surveys. This can help ensure that the voices of individuals from ethnically full Hispanic backgrounds are heard and valued.
5. Cultural competency training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers to help them understand and appreciate the perspectives and experiences of individuals from diverse ethnic backgrounds.
6. Accountability mechanisms: Establish accountability mechanisms to ensure that decision-makers are held responsible for incorporating the voices of underrepresented groups in their decision-making processes. This can involve setting clear goals and targets, monitoring progress, and holding decision-makers accountable for achieving these goals.
7. Building partnerships: Foster partnerships between organizations that represent ethnically full Hispanic communities and decision-making bodies to ensure that the voices of these communities are heard and valued.
8. Advocacy and activism: Support advocacy and activist efforts that promote the rights and interests of ethnically full Hispanic communities, and work to hold decision-makers accountable for incorporating their perspectives in decision-making
