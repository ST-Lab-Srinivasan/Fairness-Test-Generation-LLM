Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Long-Term Undocumented Canadian Citizens

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and lives of individuals within any given community. For long-term undocumented Canadian citizens, cultural heritage can serve as a source of comfort, strength, and belonging. This qualitative study aims to investigate the role that cultural heritage plays in the lives of this particular group of individuals, examining how their cultural background influences their experiences, beliefs, and practices.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on the mental health and wellbeing of immigrant populations (Nguyen et al., 2017). For undocumented individuals, who often face additional challenges such as social isolation and marginalization, cultural heritage can provide a sense of connection to their roots and community (Mendoza & Garcia, 2016). Moreover, cultural heritage can serve as a means of resistance and survival in the face of oppression (Gillborn & Youdell, 2003).

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews to collect data from long-term undocumented Canadian citizens. Participants were recruited through community-based organizations and social media platforms. The sample consisted of 15 participants, aged between 25 and 60 years old, representing diverse cultural backgrounds.

Results:
The findings highlight the significant role that cultural heritage plays in the lives of long-term undocumented Canadian citizens. Participants expressed how their cultural practices and traditions helped them cope with the challenges of living in a foreign country without proper documentation. For instance, one participant shared how their family's cultural traditions provided a sense of belonging and identity, despite facing discrimination and marginalization in their daily lives.

Another key theme that emerged from the interviews was the importance of cultural heritage in creating a sense of community and social support. Participants noted how their cultural background helped them connect with other immigrant groups and form alliances, which provided emotional and practical support during difficult times.
