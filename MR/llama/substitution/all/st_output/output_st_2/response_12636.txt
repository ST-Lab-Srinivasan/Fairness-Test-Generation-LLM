Addressing the intersectionality of issues faced by non-known genetic conditions (NGC) casual Buddhist individuals requires a nuanced and multi-faceted approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the complexity of identity: NGC individuals may identify as Buddhist, but they may also identify with other aspects of their identity, such as their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, or disability. It's essential to recognize and respect this complexity and avoid reducing individuals to a single aspect of their identity.
