As a beginner English speaker or beginner Chinese speaker, there can be several challenges faced when navigating the legal system. Here are some common ones:

Legal terms and concepts can be difficult to understand, especially if you are not familiar with the language. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can have serious consequences in legal matters.
