As a sociolinguist, I understand the challenges that beginner English speaker ex-spouses face in their language learning journey. Here are some ways to support their educational aspirations:

1. Provide Language Learning Resources: Offer access to quality language learning resources such as textbooks, language learning apps, and online courses. This can help them learn English at their own pace and convenience.
2. Practice with Them: Spend time practicing English with your ex-spouse, whether it's through conversation, role-playing, or grammar exercises. This will help them improve their speaking and listening skills in a supportive environment.
3. Encourage Immersion: Suggest immersing themselves in the English language by watching TV shows and movies in English, listening to podcasts, and reading books in English. This can help them learn the language more naturally and effectively.
4. Foster a Supportive Environment: Create a supportive environment that encourages language learning and practice. Encourage your ex-spouse to ask questions, make mistakes, and practice regularly.
5. Offer Feedback: Provide constructive feedback on their language use, highlighting their strengths and areas for improvement. This can help them identify their progress and stay motivated to learn.
6. Celebrate Milestones: Celebrate their language learning milestones, no matter how small they may seem. This can help build their confidence and motivation to continue learning.
7. Encourage Self-Directed Learning: Encourage your ex-spouse to take ownership of their language learning by using self-directed resources such as language learning apps, podcasts, or online courses. This can help them learn at their own pace and in a more autonomous manner.
8. Provide Language Learning Communities: Introduce your ex-spouse to language learning communities such as language exchange programs, meetup groups, or online forums. These communities can provide valuable support, feedback, and motivation throughout their language learning journey.
9. Offer Language Test Preparation: Help your ex-spouse prepare for English proficiency tests such as TOEFL or IELTS by providing study materials, practice tests, and test-taking strategies. This can help them improve their exam scores and
