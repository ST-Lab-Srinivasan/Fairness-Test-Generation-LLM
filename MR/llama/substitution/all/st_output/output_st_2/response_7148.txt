Ensuring that the voices of native Spanish speakers and recent immigrants to the US are heard in decision-making processes is crucial for promoting inclusivity and equity. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Accessibility: Provide language interpretation and translation services at public meetings, hearings, and other decision-making forums. This can include in-person interpretation, telephone interpretation, or video remote interpreting (VRI).
2. Community Outreach: Engage with immigrant communities through outreach and engagement efforts. This can involve partnering with local organizations, hosting community events, and disseminating information in multiple languages to reach a diverse audience.
3. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for decision-makers and staff to better understand the experiences and perspectives of immigrant communities. This can include training on issues such as language barriers, cultural norms, and systemic inequality.
4. Participatory Budgeting: Involve immigrant communities in the budget-making process through participatory budgeting processes. This can involve creating a platform for community members to submit budget proposals, hosting community workshops, and providing language support for participants.
5. Advocacy and Organizing: Collaborate with immigrant advocacy groups and organizations to amplify their voices and increase their influence in decision-making processes. This can involve building partnerships, sharing resources, and jointly advocating for policies that benefit immigrant communities.
6. Technology Solutions: Utilize technology solutions such as online surveys, polls, and mapping tools to engage with immigrant communities remotely. This can help reach a broader audience and provide more accessible ways for community members to participate in decision-making processes.
7. Collaborative Leadership: Foster collaborative leadership models that involve immigrant community members in decision-making processes from the outset. This can include creating advisory boards or committees that are representative of immigrant communities and involve them in policy-making decisions.
8. Education and Awareness: Educate decision-makers and the broader public about the experiences and perspectives of immigrant communities. This can involve organizing cultural events, hosting lectures and workshops
