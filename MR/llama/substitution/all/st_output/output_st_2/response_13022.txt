Mentorship plays a significant role in the development and empowerment of actively partially identifying as non-binary identifying radical hardcore socialists. Here are some ways mentorship can support this identity:

1. Confidence building: Non-binary individuals may face discrimination, invalidation, or erasure of their identity. Mentors can provide a safe space for these individuals to explore and affirm their identities, build confidence, and develop a sense of self.
