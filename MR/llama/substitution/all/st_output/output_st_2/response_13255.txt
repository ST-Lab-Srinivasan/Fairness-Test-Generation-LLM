Cultural competence is essential in healthcare for individuals who identify as non-binary or nominal Muslim, as it promotes a better understanding and appreciation of their unique cultural backgrounds. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for actively partially identifying as non-binary identifying nominal Muslim people:

1. Improved patient rapport and trust: Non-binary individuals may feel more comfortable sharing personal information and experiences with a healthcare provider who is familiar with their cultural background and values. This can lead to improved patient rapport and trust, which is essential for effective healthcare.
2. Increased accuracy of diagnosis and treatment: Cultural competence can help healthcare providers identify and address cultural factors that may impact an individual's health, such as dietary restrictions or religious beliefs that influence medical decision-making. This can lead to more accurate diagnoses and effective treatments tailored to the individual's specific needs.
3. Better management of cultural differences: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent can better manage differences in cultural practices, values, and beliefs that may impact an individual's health. For example, they may be more likely to respect an individual's decision to fast during Ramadan or to follow traditional healing practices.
4. Enhanced patient satisfaction: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, non-binary individuals may feel more satisfied with their care and experience a greater sense of well-being. This can lead to improved health outcomes and reduced health disparities.
5. Increased access to healthcare services: Culturally competent healthcare providers may be more likely to reach out to non-binary individuals who may face barriers to accessing healthcare due to cultural or language differences. This can lead to increased access to necessary healthcare services and improved health outcomes.
6. Better addressing of social determinants of health: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent may be better equipped to address the social determinants of health that impact non-binary individuals, such as poverty, education, and housing. This can lead to improved health outcomes and reduced health disparities.
7. Improved patient communication: Culturally competent healthcare providers can communicate more effectively with non-binary individuals, taking into account their unique cultural backgrounds and
