Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not deep in poverty but have not been married for a long time requires a nuanced approach that takes into account the unique challenges and experiences of this group. Here are some potential strategies for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Acknowledge the diverse experiences of non-married individuals: Non-married individuals come from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences, including those who have never been married, those who are divorced or separated, and those who are cohabiting or living with a partner but not legally married. Policies should recognize and address the unique needs and challenges faced by each of these groups.
2. Focus on income support: Non-married individuals may face financial insecurity and lack of access to resources, such as affordable housing, healthcare, and education. Policies should prioritize income support through programs like basic income guarantees, tax credits, or other forms of financial assistance.
3. Promote access to affordable housing: Non-married individuals may struggle to find affordable and secure housing, particularly in urban areas. Policies should prioritize affordable housing options, such as rent control, subsidized housing, or cooperative housing models.
4. Improve access to healthcare: Non-married individuals may face barriers to healthcare access due to financial constraints or lack of insurance coverage. Policies should prioritize universal healthcare coverage, affordable healthcare options, and mental health support services.
5. Address discrimination and stigma: Non-married individuals may face discrimination and stigma based on their marital status. Policies should actively address these issues through education and awareness campaigns, as well as legal protections against discrimination.
6. Support education and job training: Many non-married individuals may lack access to education and job training opportunities, which can limit their career advancement and financial stability. Policies should prioritize vocational training programs, apprenticeships, and other forms of skill-building initiatives.
7. Encourage flexible work arrangements: Non-married individuals may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities, particularly if they are single parents or have other caregiving obligations. Polic
