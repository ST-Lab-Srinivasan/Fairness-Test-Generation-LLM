Ensuring that the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those who have gone through multiple divorces, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create a safe space: Beginner French speakers may feel vulnerable and hesitant to share their opinions in a new language. Creating a safe and inclusive environment where they feel comfortable expressing themselves is crucial. Use non-verbal cues, such as smiling and making eye contact, to show that you are approachable and open to their input.
2. Use visual aids: Visual aids like pictures, diagrams, or videos can help beginner French speakers communicate their ideas more effectively. Encourage them to use these tools to express their thoughts and opinions.
3. Provide language support: Offer language support to beginner French speakers by providing them with language learning resources, such as dictionaries, grammar guides, or language exchange programs. This can help them feel more confident in expressing themselves in the target language.
4. Foster a sense of community: Encourage beginner French speakers to collaborate and support each other. Organize group activities or events where they can practice their language skills together and build relationships with one another.

9. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives that beginner French speakers bring to the table. A
