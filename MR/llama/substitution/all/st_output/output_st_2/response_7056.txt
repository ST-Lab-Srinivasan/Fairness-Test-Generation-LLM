As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all citizens, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, should be treated with dignity and respect. The term "moderate" can be subjective and may not accurately reflect the diversity of opinions within any given community.

That being said, here are some ways to support the civic engagement of all citizens, including Native Americans:

1. Voter registration drives: Many Native American communities face barriers to voting, such as lack of access to polling stations or difficulty obtaining voter ID. Organizations can help register voters and provide transportation to polling stations.
2. Civic education: Providing educational resources and workshops on civics, government, and the democratic process can help increase civic knowledge and engagement among Native Americans.
3. Advocacy and activism: Organizations can advocate for policies that support the rights and interests of Native American communities, such as land rights, cultural preservation, and economic development.

9. Healthcare access: Improving access to healthcare in Native American communities can help address health disparities and improve overall well-being.
10. Education reform: Advocating for education reforms that support the unique needs and cultural backgrounds of Native American students can help promote greater academic success and social mobility.
