As a compassionate and empathetic AI language model, I appreciate your desire to create more inclusive community programs for individuals who have gone through multiple divorces, especially those who identify as extreme soft libertarians. Here are some suggestions on how to design such programs:

1. Understand their needs and concerns: It's essential to understand the unique challenges and concerns of this group. Many extreme soft libertarians may value independence and autonomy, but they may also struggle with feelings of loneliness and isolation. Programs should prioritize creating a safe and supportive environment where individuals can share their experiences without fear of judgment.
2. Focus on personal growth: Divorce can be a transformative experience that prompts individuals to reassess their values, beliefs, and goals. Community programs could focus on providing resources for personal growth, such as workshops on mindfulness, meditation, or journaling. These activities can help individuals process their emotions and develop coping strategies.

Community programs could organize social events or group outings that cater to the interests of extreme soft libertarians, such as book clubs, hiking trips, or board game nights.

Community programs could provide resources for divorced individuals to access legal advice, financial planning, or tax preparation services. This support can help reduce stress and anxiety related to these matters.
