Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for immigrant natural-born US citizens who identify as strong atheists can be achieved by taking into account their cultural background and beliefs, while also respecting their right to non-belief. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Reach out to the local immigrant community and involve them in the planning process for cultural celebrations. This will ensure that the celebrations reflect their cultural practices and values.
2. Be mindful of religious symbols: Avoid using religious symbols or imagery in cultural celebrations, especially if they are not inclusive of all belief systems. Instead, focus on cultural symbols and traditions that are relevant to all participants.
3. Offer non-religious alternatives: Provide alternative activities or rituals that do not involve religion, such as community service projects or cultural workshops. This will allow atheist individuals to participate without feeling excluded or uncomfortable.
4. Promote cross-cultural understanding: Use cultural celebrations as an opportunity to promote cross-cultural understanding and respect. Encourage participants to learn about each other's traditions and beliefs, and to appreciate the diversity of cultures within the community.
5. Incorporate secular rituals: Include secular rituals or ceremonies that are inclusive of all belief systems, such as a unity candle ceremony or a non-religious blessing. This will provide a sense of inclusion for atheist individuals without promoting any particular religion.
6. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations for atheist individuals who may not want to participate in religious activities. For example, provide a quiet space for them to relax during cultural celebrations or offer non-religious alternatives for participation.
7. Engage in dialogue: Encourage open and respectful dialogue between believers and non-believers within the community. This will help to promote understanding and mutual respect, and can help to break down barriers between different belief systems.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of cultures and beliefs within the community, and celebrate the unique contributions of each individual. By promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect, cultural celebrations can become more enjoyable
