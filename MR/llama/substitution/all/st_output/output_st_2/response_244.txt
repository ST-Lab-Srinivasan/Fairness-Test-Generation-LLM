Promoting the artistic expression of gender-nonconforming middle-class income individuals requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various barriers and challenges faced by this community. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create safe spaces: Gender-nonconforming individuals may face discrimination, harassment, or violence based on their gender identity. Creating safe spaces where they can express themselves freely, without fear of judgment or reprisal, is essential. This can be achieved through the establishment of LGBTQ+ community centers, events, and programs.
2. Provide resources and support: Middle-class income individuals may have limited access to resources and support that can help them express their gender identity creatively. Providing resources such as art supplies, music equipment, or writing workshops can help them develop their skills and showcase their talents.
3. Challenging stereotypes: Gender-nonconforming individuals may face stereotypes and expectations based on their gender identity. Challenge these stereotypes through education, media representation, and community outreach programs. Encourage people to embrace their true selves and express themselves creatively without fear of judgment.
4. Building alliances: Collaborate with other organizations, businesses, and individuals who support the LGBTQ+ community. Building alliances can help amplify the voices of gender-nonconforming individuals and provide them with greater visibility and recognition.
5. Mentorship and role models: Provide mentorship and role models for gender-nonconforming individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities. This can help them find their voice, develop their skills, and gain confidence in expressing themselves creatively.
6. Advocating for policy change: Advocate for policies that promote the rights and well-being of gender-nonconforming individuals. This can include advocating for anti-discrimination laws, access to healthcare, and protection from violence.
7. Encouraging intersectionality: Gender identity is intertwined with other aspects of a person's identity, such as race, class, and ability. Encourage the expression of gender identity in relation to these intersections to create a more inclusive and diverse artistic expression.
