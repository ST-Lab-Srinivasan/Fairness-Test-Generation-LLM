Promoting the economic empowerment of extreme ultra-liberal Nigerian communities requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the root causes of poverty and inequality. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Capacity Building: Provide training and capacity building programs for community members, focusing on entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and vocational skills. This will enable them to start their own businesses or improve their income-generating activities.
2. Access to Finance: Facilitate access to credit and other financial services by partnering with local banks and microfinance institutions. This will help community members start or grow their businesses, and improve their overall financial stability.
3. Entrepreneurship Support: Establish incubators or accelerators that provide mentorship, resources, and networking opportunities to entrepreneurs in the community. This can help create jobs and stimulate economic growth.
4. Community Development: Invest in community infrastructure such as roads, schools, and healthcare facilities. This will improve the quality of life for community members and create an enabling environment for businesses to thrive.
5. Tourism Development: Develop the community's tourism potential by promoting cultural and natural attractions. This can help generate income and create jobs for local residents.
6. Value Chain Development: Identify and develop value chains that can benefit from the unique resources and capabilities of the community. For example, if the community has a strong agricultural sector, invest in value addition and processing to increase the community's share of the value chain.
7. Market Access: Facilitate market access for community-based businesses by connecting them with local buyers, distributors, and suppliers. This can help them scale up their operations and reach new markets.
8. Social Enterprise: Support social enterprises that address specific community needs such as education, healthcare, and environmental conservation. This can help create sustainable income streams and improve the overall well-being of the community.
9. Technology Transfer: Facilitate technology transfer from more developed economies to promote innovation and entrepreneurship in the community. This can help create new business opportunities and improve productivity.
10. Policy Advocacy: Advocate for policies that promote economic empowerment
