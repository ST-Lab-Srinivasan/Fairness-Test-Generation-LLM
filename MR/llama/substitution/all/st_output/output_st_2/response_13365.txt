Creating educational programs that are inclusive of early teen (13-15) long-term recently undocumented perspectives requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the experiences of young undocumented immigrants: It is essential to listen to and learn from the experiences of young undocumented immigrants themselves. This can involve conducting research, holding focus groups or interviews, and engaging in ongoing dialogue with this population.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the educational programs are designed and delivered by a team of educators who reflect the diversity of the students they serve. This can include hiring teachers and staff who are themselves immigrants, refugees, or members of other marginalized communities.
3. Use inclusive language and materials: Use language and materials that are inclusive and respectful of all cultures and backgrounds. Avoid using language or perpetuating stereotypes that may be offensive to certain groups.
4. Foster a safe and supportive learning environment: Create a learning environment that is welcoming, inclusive, and supportive of all students, regardless of their immigration status. This can involve providing counseling services, mental health resources, and other forms of support for students who may be experiencing trauma or stress related to their immigration status.
5. Address the social-emotional needs of students: Many young undocumented immigrants may be experiencing anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues related to their immigration status. Educational programs should address these social-emotional needs through counseling services, mental health resources, and other forms of support.
6. Provide access to legal resources: Many young undocumented immigrants may be unaware of their legal options or may face barriers in accessing legal resources. Educational programs can provide information about legal resources and connect students with organizations that can provide legal assistance.
7. Offer career and college readiness programming: Young undocumented immigrants may face additional challenges when it comes to preparing for college or entering the workforce. Educational programs can offer targeted Career and College Readiness programming to help students navigate these challenges.
8. Build partnerships with community
