The impact of military status on the lives of beginner English speaker non-liberal individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Language Barriers: Non-liberal individuals may face challenges when communicating in English, especially if they have limited exposure to the language or come from a non-English speaking background. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and difficulties in navigating everyday situations.
2. Cultural Differences: Military culture can be quite different from civilian culture, and beginner English speakers may struggle to adapt to these differences. For example, military protocols and customs may be unfamiliar or even contradictory to those outside of the military.
3. Isolation and Loneliness: Non-liberal individuals may find themselves feeling isolated or lonely in their new environment, particularly if they are unable to connect with others due to language barriers or cultural differences.
4. Limited Access to Resources: Military bases often have limited resources, including access to healthcare, education, and other services. Beginner English speakers may face challenges accessing these resources, particularly if they do not speak the local language fluently.
5. Discrimination and Bias: Unfortunately, non-liberal individuals may face discrimination or bias based on their military status or cultural background. This can lead to feelings of isolation, marginalization, or even harassment.
6. Difficulty Adapting to Civilian Life: When non-liberal individuals leave the military, they may struggle to adapt to civilian life. This can be particularly challenging if they have been in the military for a long time or have experienced trauma during their service.
7. Stress and Anxiety: The transition from military to civilian life can be stressful and anxiety-provoking, particularly for beginner English speakers who may face additional challenges related to language barriers or cultural differences.
8. Difficulty Navigating Bureaucracy: Military bases often have complex bureaucratic systems that can be difficult for non-liberal individuals to navigate, particularly if they are not familiar with the local language or culture.
9. Limited Access to Support Services: Military bases may have limited access to support services, such as mental health resources or financial counseling
