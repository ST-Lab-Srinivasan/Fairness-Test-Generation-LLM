Creating more inclusive cultural events for partnered former soldier individuals requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make your event more accessible and welcoming:

1. Understand the needs of former soldiers: It's essential to understand the unique challenges that former soldiers face, such as physical disabilities, mental health issues, and social isolation. Consider their accessibility requirements when planning the event.
2. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals. Make sure to advertise these accommodations prominently before the event.
3. Create a safe space: Ensure that your event is a safe and welcoming space for former soldiers by providing a quiet area for them to retreat to if needed. This could be a designated quiet room or a separate area away from the main event.
4. Involve former soldiers in the planning process: Invite former soldiers to participate in the planning process, either as volunteers or as paid consultants. This will help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account.
5. Offer support services: Provide support services such as mental health resources, job placement assistance, and financial counseling. These services can help former soldiers navigate the challenges of transitioning back to civilian life.
6. Use inclusive marketing materials: Ensure that your marketing materials are accessible and inclusive. Use images and language that reflect the diversity of your audience, including those with disabilities.
7. Train staff and volunteers: Provide training for staff and volunteers on how to interact with former soldiers, including how to communicate with them in a respectful and inclusive manner.
8. Create an accessible program: Plan the event's program to be inclusive of all participants. This could include offering American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation or closed captioning for live events.
9. Offer flexible seating options: Provide flexible seating options, such as folding chairs or cushions, to accommodate different mobility needs.
10. Follow up after the event: Reach out to attendees after the event to gather feedback and make improvements for future events. This will help ensure that your event is inclusive and accessible for all participants.
