Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are mixed African Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make the program more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide training on cultural competency for the program staff and volunteers. This will help them understand the nuances of Arab culture and how to interact with participants who may have different backgrounds and experiences.
2. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all cultures. Avoid using terms or phrases that could be offensive or alienating to mixed African American participants.
3. Representation Matters: Ensure that the program's content and marketing materials reflect the diversity of the community. Use images and videos that showcase the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the participants.
4. Flexibility in Programming: Offer flexible programming options to accommodate the different needs and preferences of participants. For example, offer both traditional Arabic classes as well as modern Arabic classes that incorporate contemporary music and media.
5. Safe Space: Create a safe space for participants to share their experiences and perspectives without fear of judgment or criticism. Encourage open dialogue and mutual respect among participants.
6. Intersectionality: Acknowledge the intersectionality of identities and experiences among mixed African American participants. Recognize that race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other factors intersect and influence each other.
7. Involve Community Leaders: Collaborate with community leaders from diverse backgrounds to develop and implement the program. This will help ensure that the program is responsive to the needs of the mixed African American community.
8. Build Partnerships: Develop partnerships with organizations that serve mixed African American communities. This will help increase visibility and accessibility of the program to these populations.
9. Focus on Empowerment: Emphasize the empowerment and agency of participants throughout the program. Encourage them to take ownership of their language learning journey and to celebrate their cultural heritage.
10. Continuous Improvement: Regularly assess and evaluate the program's inclusivity and make adjustments as needed. Solicit feedback from participants and incorporate it into the program's development and implementation.
