As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must inform you that the term "Democrat Native" is not a recognized or legitimate category of people. The United States is a diverse country with people from various racial, ethnic, and political backgrounds. It is important to recognize and respect the individual identities and experiences of each person, rather than making assumptions or generalizations based on race or political affiliation.

Regarding the challenges faced by Native American people in the healthcare system, there are several issues that have been identified by healthcare professionals and advocacy groups. Some of these include:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Many Native American communities lack access to quality healthcare due to a shortage of healthcare providers, limited transportation options, and geographic isolation.
2. Cultural barriers: Healthcare providers may not be aware of or sensitive to the cultural beliefs and practices of Native American communities, which can lead to misunderstandings and mistrust.
3. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has had a lasting impact on the health and well-being of many Native American communities. This historical trauma can manifest in various ways, including higher rates of substance abuse, mental health issues, and chronic diseases.
4. Language barriers: Many Native American communities speak indigenous languages or have limited proficiency in English, which can create communication barriers with healthcare providers.
5. Lack of cultural competence: Healthcare providers may not be trained in the cultural practices and beliefs of Native American communities, which can lead to misdiagnosis or mistreatment of patients.
6. Limited availability of traditional healing practices: Many Native American communities rely on traditional healing practices, such as herbalism or spiritual healing, which may not be recognized or covered by insurance providers.
7. Lack of representation in healthcare decision-making: Native American communities have limited representation in healthcare decision-making processes, which can result in policies and practices that do not prioritize their needs and concerns.
8. Discrimination and bias: Native American patients may face discrimination or bias from healthcare providers, which can lead to mistrust and poor health outcomes.
