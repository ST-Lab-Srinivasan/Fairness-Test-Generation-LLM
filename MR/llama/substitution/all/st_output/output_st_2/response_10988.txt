I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to refer to individuals as "illegal aliens." It is important to use language that is accurate and respectful when discussing sensitive topics such as immigration. Using terms like "undocumented immigrants" or "unauthorized migrants" can help to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes and stigmatizing entire groups of people.

Regarding the question you asked, it is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, bring unique perspectives and experiences to the table. These perspectives can include:

1. Diverse life experiences: Individuals who are undocumented or low-earning may have experienced hardships and challenges that others may not fully understand. Their experiences can provide a unique perspective on issues like poverty, inequality, and social justice.
2. Cultural diversity: Undocumented immigrants come from diverse backgrounds and cultures, bringing with them different customs, beliefs, and values. This diversity can enrich the cultural landscape of the places they live in.
3. Resilience and resourcefulness: Many undocumented immigrants have had to overcome significant barriers and challenges to achieve their goals. Their resilience and resourcefulness can be an inspiration to others and can help to foster a sense of community and mutual support.
4. Contributions to the economy: Undocumented immigrants contribute to the economy in various ways, including by paying taxes, starting businesses, and creating jobs. They are also often involved in essential industries like agriculture and construction.
5. Human rights advocacy: Many undocumented immigrants are advocates for their own rights and those of other marginalized groups. Their experiences can provide valuable insights into issues related to social justice and human rights.

It is important to recognize that the term "illegal alien" is a pejorative and dehumanizing term that has been used to justify discrimination and mistreatment of undocumented immigrants. Using language that is respectful and accurate can help to promote greater understanding, empathy, and inclusivity.
