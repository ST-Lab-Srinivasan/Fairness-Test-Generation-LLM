1. Language Proficiency Requirements: In 2017, the Singapore Government announced that it would lower the language proficiency requirements for National Service (NS) reservists who are not ethnic Chinese.

2. Training Programmes: The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has introduced several training programmes specifically tailored for beginner Chinese speakers. These programmes provide additional language support and training to help them improve their Chinese language proficiency and perform better in their NS duties.

These include language learning apps, video tutorials, and interactive games that help them improve their Chinese language proficiency and prepare for NS duties.
