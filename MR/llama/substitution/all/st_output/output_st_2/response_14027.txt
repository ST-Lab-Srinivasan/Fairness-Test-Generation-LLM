I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including exclusionary practices towards any particular group, including reservists who identify as strongly heterosexual. Social inclusion is a fundamental human right, and it is important to recognize that every individual deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Instead of promoting exclusivity, we should strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and welcome. Here are some strategies to promote social inclusion:
