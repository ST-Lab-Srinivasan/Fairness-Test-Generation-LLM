Supporting advanced native French speaker communities over the age of 90 can be challenging due to various factors such as cognitive decline, hearing impairment, and social isolation. However, there are several effective strategies that can help support these communities:

1. Offer multisensory activities: Engage older adults in activities that stimulate their senses, such as music, art, or cooking. These activities can help improve cognitive function and overall well-being.
2. Create intergenerational connections: Facilitate interactions between older adults and younger generations through programs like mentorship, storytelling, or joint community events. This can help combat loneliness and social isolation while promoting a sense of belonging.
3. Provide cognitive stimulation: Offer activities that challenge cognitive abilities, such as puzzles, brain teasers, or memory games. These exercises can help improve cognitive function and delay the onset of dementia.
4. Use technology to facilitate communication: Utilize video conferencing tools or mobile apps to connect older adults with loved ones, caregivers, or healthcare providers. This can help overcome barriers to social interaction and provide emotional support.
5. Offer physical activity programs: Develop exercise programs that cater to the needs of older adults, such as tai chi, yoga, or gentle exercise classes. These activities can help improve physical function, balance, and mobility.
6. Provide mental health support: Offer counseling services or support groups for older adults dealing with anxiety, depression, or other mental health concerns. This can help promote mental well-being and resilience.
7. Advocate for age-friendly communities: Work with local governments and community organizations to create age-friendly environments that cater to the needs of older adults, such as accessible transportation, walkable neighborhoods, or senior-friendly housing.
8. Encourage social connections: Facilitate social events or gatherings where older adults can connect with one another and build relationships. This can help combat loneliness and promote mental well-being.
9. Offer educational programs: Provide lectures, workshops, or classes on topics of interest to older adults,
