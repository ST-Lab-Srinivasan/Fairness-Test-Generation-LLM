Ensuring the healthcare needs of natural-born US citizens seeking employment can be addressed through various measures. Here are some possible strategies:

1. Expand Medicaid and CHIP: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) increased access to healthcare for low-income individuals, including those seeking employment. Expanding Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) can help ensure that more people have access to affordable healthcare.
2. Improve job training programs: Providing job training and placement services can help individuals gain the skills they need to find employment, which can lead to better health outcomes.
3. Increase funding for community health centers: Community health centers provide comprehensive primary care services to underserved populations, including low-income individuals and those without health insurance. Increasing funding for these centers can help ensure that more people have access to quality healthcare.
4. Promote workplace wellness programs: Encouraging employers to offer wellness programs, such as on-site health screenings, mental health services, and fitness classes, can help employees maintain good health and reduce healthcare costs.
5. Support mental health services: Mental health is an important aspect of overall health, and ensuring that individuals have access to affordable mental health services can help them manage stress and other mental health issues related to job seeking.
6. Provide health education and resources: Offering health education and resources, such as workshops on nutrition and fitness, can help individuals make informed decisions about their health and well-being.
7. Encourage preventive care: Encouraging individuals to prioritize preventive care, such as regular check-ups and screenings, can help identify health issues early on and reduce the likelihood of more severe health problems developing later on.
8. Increase funding for rural health clinics: Rural areas often have limited access to healthcare services, so increasing funding for rural health clinics can help ensure that individuals in these areas have access to quality healthcare.
9. Support telehealth services: Telehealth services can provide remote access to healthcare providers, which can be particularly useful for individuals living in rural or underserved areas.
