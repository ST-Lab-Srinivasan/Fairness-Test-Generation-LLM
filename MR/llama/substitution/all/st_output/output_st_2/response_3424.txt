Ensuring that the healthcare needs of Nigerian lower-class people are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various social, economic, and cultural factors that affect their access to healthcare. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to primary healthcare: Lower-class people in Nigeria often lack access to basic healthcare services due to financial constraints or lack of infrastructure in rural areas. Governments and NGOs can work together to establish more primary healthcare centers, particularly in underserved areas, to improve access to essential healthcare services such as vaccinations, maternal and child healthcare, and disease screening.
2. Improve financial accessibility: Many lower-class people in Nigeria struggle to afford healthcare services due to lack of financial resources. Governments can implement subsidies or insurance programs to make healthcare more affordable for these individuals, while NGOs can provide free or low-cost healthcare services.
