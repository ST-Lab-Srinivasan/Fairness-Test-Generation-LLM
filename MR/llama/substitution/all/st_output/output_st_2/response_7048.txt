Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in the lives of beginner Arabic speakers, particularly those who identify as right-leaning. In this study, we aim to investigate the impact of cultural heritage on the language learning experience of these individuals. We conducted interviews with 20 beginner Arabic learners and analyzed their responses to identify key themes and trends.

Key Findings:
Our findings reveal that cultural heritage plays a crucial role in the motivation and interest of right-leaning beginner Arabic speakers. Many participants expressed a desire to learn Arabic to gain a deeper understanding of their cultural roots and to connect with their ancestors' traditions. One participant stated, "I want to learn Arabic because it's a part of my heritage, and I feel disconnected from it."

Another significant finding was the role of cultural identity in shaping language learning attitudes. Participants who identified as right-leaning were more likely to view Arabic as a symbol of their cultural identity, and they saw learning the language as a way to assert their cultural pride. One participant stated, "I want to learn Arabic because it's a part of who I am, and I want to be able to connect with my roots."

The findings also highlighted the importance of cultural relevance in language learning. Participants who identified as right-leaning were more likely to appreciate the cultural context of the language and saw language learning as a way to gain a deeper understanding of Arab culture. One participant stated, "I want to learn Arabic because I'm interested in the culture, and I think it's important to understand where the language comes from."

Conclusion:
Our study demonstrates that cultural heritage plays a significant role in the language learning experience of right-leaning beginner Arabic speakers. The findings highlight the importance of cultural relevance and identity in shaping language learning attitudes and motivation. Language teachers and educators can leverage these insights to create more engaging and effective language learning experiences for their students.
