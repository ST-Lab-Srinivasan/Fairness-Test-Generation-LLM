Promoting the artistic expression of infant female middle-class individuals is a laudable goal, but it's important to recognize that infants are not yet capable of creating art themselves. However, there are ways to support and encourage the creative development of young girls from middle-class backgrounds:

6. Provide opportunities for collaboration: Encourage girls to collaborate with other artists, either through group projects or by connecting them with other creative individuals who share similar interests.
