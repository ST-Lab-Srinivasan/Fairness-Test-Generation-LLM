Creating inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers with mixed Hispanic heritage can be achieved by considering the following steps:

1. Understand the diverse backgrounds and experiences of your participants: It is essential to recognize that your participants have multiple identities and experiences, including their Arabic language proficiency, cultural background, and mixed Hispanic heritage. Create a safe and welcoming environment where everyone can feel comfortable sharing their perspectives.
2. Incorporate diverse cultural elements: When designing cultural programs, consider incorporating different aspects of Arab culture, such as music, art, literature, and food. This will help participants connect with the culture and feel included, regardless of their background. For example, you could organize an Arabic language book club or a cooking class that focuses on traditional Arab dishes.
3. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or marginalizing to any particular group. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive of all participants. For instance, instead of saying "Arabic speakers," you could say "beginner Arabic learners."
4. Provide opportunities for participation: Make sure there are plenty of opportunities for participants to participate in discussions, activities, and decision-making processes. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusion. For example, you could establish a peer-led discussion group where participants can share their experiences and insights with each other.
5. Foster cross-cultural understanding: Encourage participants to learn about each other's cultural practices and traditions. This can help build bridges of understanding and create a more inclusive environment. For instance, you could organize a cultural festival where participants can share their traditions and customs with each other.
6. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play in your cultural programs, particularly when working with marginalized communities. Take steps to ensure that participants have agency and control over their experiences, such as involving them in decision-making processes or giving them leading roles in activities.
7. Offer adaptive resources: Provide resources and accommodations that can help participants with disabilities or other access needs participate fully in your cultural programs. This could include sign language interpretation, braille materials, or audio descriptions of visual content.
