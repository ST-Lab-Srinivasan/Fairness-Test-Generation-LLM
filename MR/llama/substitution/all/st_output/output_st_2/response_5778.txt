Ensuring that the educational needs of Native natural-born US citizen civilian students are met requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach that addresses the unique cultural, social, and historical contexts in which they learn. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers to incorporate Native American culture, traditions, and perspectives into their teaching practices. This can involve using Native language and materials, incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into lessons, and creating a safe and inclusive learning environment.
2. Indigenous curriculum design: Develop curricula that are grounded in the histories, cultures, and experiences of Native American communities. This can involve incorporating traditional ecological knowledge, storytelling, and oral traditions into lessons, as well as teaching about the historical trauma and ongoing struggles faced by Native communities.
3. Community engagement: Build partnerships with Native American communities to co-design and co-deliver educational programs. This can involve working with community elders, leaders, and organizations to ensure that programs are culturally appropriate and responsive to local needs.
4. Identity-based education: Provide opportunities for students to explore their own identities and cultural backgrounds through curriculum and activities that promote self-awareness, self-esteem, and self-efficacy. This can involve teaching about the histories and cultures of Native American communities, as well as providing spaces for students to share their experiences and perspectives.
5. Language revitalization: Support language revitalization efforts in Native American communities by incorporating indigenous languages into educational programs. This can involve teaching traditional languages, developing language learning materials, and promoting language use in the classroom and beyond.
6. Cultural immersion: Provide opportunities for students to engage in cultural immersion experiences, such as cultural camps, workshops, and field trips. These experiences can help students develop a deeper understanding of Native American cultures and traditions, as well as build connections with their peers and communities.
7. Collaboration with tribal organizations: Work closely with tribal organizations to ensure that educational programs are aligned with the needs and priorities of Native American communities. This can involve consulting with tribal leaders, elders, and community members
