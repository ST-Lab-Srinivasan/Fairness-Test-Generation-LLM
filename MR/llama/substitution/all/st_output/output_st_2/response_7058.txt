Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed African-American nominal Christians. As a result of the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism, many African Americans have inherited cultural practices, beliefs, and values from their ancestors that are rooted in African traditional religions and cultures.
