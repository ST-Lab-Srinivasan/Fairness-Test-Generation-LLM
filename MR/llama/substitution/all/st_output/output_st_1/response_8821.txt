Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner English speakers who are ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the community's needs and interests: Conduct research to identify the specific cultural programs and activities that will be of interest to this community. Engage with members of the community to understand their preferences, needs, and goals.
2. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically designed for beginner English speakers who are ethnically full African Americans. This could include basic English language training, as well as vocabulary and grammar specific to American culture.
3. Offer cultural orientation: Provide cultural orientation programs that introduce participants to American customs, traditions, and values. This could include information on etiquette, communication styles, and social norms.
4. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs are inclusive of diverse perspectives and experiences. Use materials and resources that reflect the backgrounds and experiences of ethnically full African Americans, and incorporate their voices and stories into the program.
5. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for participants to connect with one another and build relationships. This could include social events, volunteer opportunities, or peer support groups.
6. Provide accessibility features: Ensure that the cultural programs are accessible to participants with disabilities. Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, wheelchair accessibility, and audio descriptions.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Acknowledge the historical and systemic power imbalances that exist within communities of color. Be aware of the ways in which cultural programs can perpetuate or challenge these power dynamics, and work to create spaces that are inclusive and empowering for all participants.
8. Engage with local organizations: Collaborate with local organizations that serve ethnically full African American communities. This could include community centers, churches, and other organizations that provide cultural programming and support.
9. Offer flexible scheduling options: Provide cultural programs at times and locations that are convenient for participants who may have busy schedules or limited mobility.
10. Evaluate and improve: Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the cultural programs and make improvements based on feedback from participants.
