The impact of marital status on the lives of widowed individuals, particularly those who have been widowed for a long time and identify as ultra-conservative, can be significant. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Emotional Distress: Losing a spouse can lead to intense emotional distress, including grief, sadness, anger, and anxiety. Widowed individuals may struggle to cope with the loss of their partner, particularly if they were married for a long time or have children together.
2. Social Isolation: Widowed individuals may experience social isolation, as they may feel disconnected from their social networks and find it difficult to connect with others who do not share their experiences. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression.
3. Financial Insecurity: Widows may face financial insecurity, particularly if their spouse was the primary breadwinner or if they have limited financial resources. They may struggle to make ends meet, especially if they have dependents.
4. Lack of Purpose: Losing a spouse can lead to a sense of loss of purpose, as individuals may feel that their identity and meaning in life were closely tied to their relationship. This can lead to feelings of aimlessness and disorientation.
5. Stigma: Widowed individuals may face social stigma, particularly if they are from conservative or traditional communities. They may be viewed as being "damaged" or "broken," which can further exacerbate their emotional distress.
6. Lack of Support: Ultra-conservative communities may not provide adequate support to widowed individuals, particularly if they are seen as being outside the norm. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection from society.
7. Difficulty Adjusting to New Role: Widows may struggle to adjust to their new role as a single person, particularly if they were used to being in a partnership for many years. They may feel uncertain about how to navigate their new life without their spouse.
8. Limited Access to Resources: Widowed individuals may have limited access to resources such as healthcare, legal support, and financial assistance, particularly if they are from low-income backgrounds or live in areas with limited infrastructure.
