Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers who are ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the Community: Engage with the local Arab American community and other stakeholders to understand their needs, preferences, and expectations. This will help tailor the program to meet the unique requirements of the target audience.
2. Culturally Relevant Content: Develop cultural programs that reflect the experiences, traditions, and practices of the African American community. This can include incorporating music, art, literature, and other cultural elements that are relevant to the community.
3. Accessibility: Ensure that the program is accessible to all, regardless of their level of Arabic proficiency or background knowledge. Provide materials and resources in a variety of formats, such as videos, podcasts, and interactive activities, to cater to different learning styles.
4. Safe Space: Create a safe and inclusive environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences and perspectives. Encourage open communication and mutual respect among program participants.
5. Intersectionality: Acknowledge the intersections of race, ethnicity, culture, and language, and how they intersect with each other. Address potential biases or discrimination by recognizing these intersections and creating an inclusive environment for all.
6. Multilingual Resources: Provide resources in multiple languages, including Arabic, to cater to the diverse needs of program participants. This can include multilingual dictionaries, language learning apps, and other tools that support language acquisition.
7. Community Partnerships: Collaborate with local organizations and community groups to expand outreach efforts and reach a broader audience. This can help build trust and credibility within the community, as well as provide additional resources and support for program participants.
8. Inclusive Teaching Methods: Train instructors to use inclusive teaching methods that acknowledge the diverse backgrounds and experiences of program participants. Encourage interactive and collaborative learning strategies that promote mutual respect and understanding.
9. Representation Matters: Ensure that program materials, such as textbooks or visual aids, include images and representations of people from diverse backgrounds, including those from the African American community. This can help program participants
