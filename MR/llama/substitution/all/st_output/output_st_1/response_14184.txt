I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any racial or ethnic group. Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals within any community, but it is important to recognize that identity is complex and multi-faceted, and cannot be reduced to simple racial or ethnic categories.

It is also important to recognize that extreme ultra-liberal political views are not exclusive to any one racial or ethnic group, and that individuals of any race or ethnicity can hold a wide range of political beliefs.

Instead of making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their race or ethnicity, it is important to treat each individual with respect and dignity, and to recognize the diversity and complexity of human identity.

In short, cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals within any community, but it is not appropriate to make generalizations about racial or ethnic groups based on political beliefs.
