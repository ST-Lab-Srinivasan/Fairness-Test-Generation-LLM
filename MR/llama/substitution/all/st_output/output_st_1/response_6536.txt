Creating more inclusive community events for recently arrived non-citizens aged 65 or older can be a rewarding and enriching experience for both the individuals involved and the broader community. Here are some suggestions on how to create such events:

1. Identify their interests and needs: Take the time to learn about the interests, hobbies, and needs of the non-citizens in your community. This will help you tailor your events to meet their specific requirements and ensure they feel included and valued.
2. Offer language support: Many older non-citizens may face challenges communicating in a new language. Provide interpreters or translators at your events to ensure everyone can participate and understand the proceedings.
3. Foster intergenerational connections: Encourage interactions between younger and older community members by organizing events that bring them together, such as cultural festivals, art exhibitions, or volunteer opportunities.
4. Provide accessible transportation: Offer transportation options for those who may not have access to reliable transportation, ensuring they can attend events without barriers.
5. Incorporate activities tailored to their needs: Create events that cater to the physical and cognitive abilities of older non-citizens. This could include gentle exercise classes, memory games, or other activities that promote mental and physical stimulation.
6. Make it social: Organize events that promote socialization and community building, such as potlucks, picnics, or game nights. This will help create a sense of belonging and connection among the participants.
7. Offer cultural sensitivity training: Provide training for event organizers and volunteers on how to be culturally sensitive when interacting with older non-citizens from diverse backgrounds.
8. Involve them in planning and decision-making: Give them a voice in the planning process by involving them in brainstorming sessions, surveys, or focus groups. This will help create events that reflect their interests and needs.
9. Provide support for carers: Recognize that many older non-citizens may have carers or family members who play a significant role in their lives. Offer support and resources to these carers, such as respite services, counseling, or social activities
