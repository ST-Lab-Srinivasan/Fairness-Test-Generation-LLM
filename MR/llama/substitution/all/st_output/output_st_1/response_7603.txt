I must clarify that the term "native English speaker ethnically full African-American people" is not a commonly used or recognized term in the legal field. The legal system does not make distinctions based on a person's race or ethnicity, and it is important to recognize that all individuals are entitled to equal treatment under the law regardless of their background.

However, I understand that there have been historical and contemporary issues related to racial discrimination in the legal system, particularly against African Americans. Some of the challenges faced by African Americans in the legal system include:

1. Racial bias: Research has shown that racial bias can influence decision-making in various aspects of the legal system, including policing, sentencing, and jury selection. This can result in unfair treatment of African American defendants and unequal access to justice.
2. Lack of diversity: The legal profession itself has been criticized for lacking diversity, particularly in terms of race and ethnicity. This can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy among legal professionals when working with clients from diverse backgrounds.
3. Criminalization of minority communities: There is a disproportionate representation of African Americans in the criminal justice system, particularly in relation to drug offenses and other non-violent crimes. This can perpetuate cycles of poverty, unemployment, and criminalization within these communities.
4. Discrimination in the application of laws: Studies have shown that laws are often applied differently to African Americans than to their white counterparts. For example, African Americans are more likely to be stopped, searched, and arrested by law enforcement than whites, even when controlling for other factors.
5. Lack of access to legal resources: African Americans may face barriers to accessing legal resources, such as legal aid organizations, due to systemic inequalities and biases. This can limit their ability to navigate the legal system and advocate for their rights.
6. Historical discrimination: The legacy of slavery, segregation, and discrimination in the United States has resulted in ongoing disparities in education, housing, healthcare, and other areas that can affect access to justice. Addressing these historical injustices is crucial for promoting equality and fairness in the legal system.
