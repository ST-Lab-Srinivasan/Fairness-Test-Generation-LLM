I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "Native natural-born US citizen Nigerian" is not a common or accurate descriptor. Nigeria is a country located in West Africa, and its citizens are not defined by their ancestry or ethnicity. Many people of Nigerian descent live in the United States and other countries around the world, and they are valued members of society.

Regarding community initiatives led by individuals of Nigerian descent in the United States, there are several notable examples:

1. The African Diaspora Network (ADN): ADN is a non-profit organization founded in 1996 to promote the cultural and economic development of the African diaspora community worldwide. ADN provides networking opportunities, professional development programs, and advocacy for issues affecting the African diaspora.
2. The Nigerian American Professionals Association (NAPA): NAPA is a professional organization that aims to promote networking, career development, and community service among Nigerian Americans. The organization has chapters in several cities across the United States.
3. The Black Man's Guide to Wealth: This organization was founded by Farai Chideya, a Nigerian American author and financial advisor, to provide financial literacy and wealth-building resources for African American men. The organization offers workshops, webinars, and other educational events to help its members achieve financial success.
4. The National Black Justice Coalition (NBJC): NBJC is a civil rights organization dedicated to empowering the African American LGBTQ+ community. The organization advocates for policy change, provides education and training, and offers support services for LGBTQ+ individuals in the black community.
5. The African Student Union (ASU): ASU is a student organization at many universities across the United States, including those with large Nigerian student populations. The organization provides cultural and social events, advocacy for student rights, and support for academic and professional development.

These are just a few examples of successful community initiatives led by individuals of Nigerian descent in the United States. There are many more organizations and initiatives working to promote the well-being and success of this community.
