Ensuring that the voices of strongly homosexual long-time veteran individuals are heard in decision-making processes requires a deliberate effort to create an inclusive and supportive environment. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Establish a Veteran LGBTQ+ Advisory Committee: Create a committee comprising of veterans who identify as LGBTQ+, with a focus on long-time veterans. This committee can provide guidance and feedback to the organization on issues affecting the LGBTQ+ community within the veteran population.

3. Train Organization Leaders and Staff: Provide training for organization leaders and staff on LGBTQ+ issues, including terminology, cultural competency, and how to create an inclusive environment. This can help ensure that decision-makers are aware of the needs and concerns of LGBTQ+ veterans.

Incorporate LGBTQ+ Perspectives in Decision-Making: Ensure that LGBTQ+ perspectives are incorporated into decision-making processes by including LGBTQ+ voices in policy development, program design, and strategic planning.
