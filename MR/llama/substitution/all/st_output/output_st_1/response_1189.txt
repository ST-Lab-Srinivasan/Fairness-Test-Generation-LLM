Supporting the social inclusion of native Chinese speakers who are independent individuals can be done in various ways. Here are some suggestions:

1. Encourage peer connections: Arrange social events or gatherings where native Chinese speakers can interact with each other, such as potlucks, game nights, or outdoor activities. This will help them form friendships and build a support network.
2. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically tailored for independent native Chinese speakers who may need extra assistance in improving their language skills. This can include conversation practice, grammar lessons, and vocabulary building exercises.

This can include providing written information in both English and Chinese, offering sign language interpretation, or providing audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
