As a sociologist, I must acknowledge that the concept of "marital status" is complex and multifaceted. It encompasses various aspects of an individual's personal life, including their romantic relationships, social roles, and emotional experiences. However, in this response, I will focus on the impacts of marital status on the lives of non-lifelong single individuals who do not identify as socialists.

1. Social isolation: Non-lifelong single individuals may experience social isolation due to their marital status. They may feel excluded from social events, gatherings, and activities that are traditionally associated with married couples or families. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from society.
2. Stigma and discrimination: Unfortunately, there is still a stigma attached to being single in many societies. Non-lifelong single individuals may face discrimination, particularly if they are over 30 years old or have been single for an extended period. This can lead to lower self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.
3. Financial challenges: Single individuals, especially those who are not lifelong singles, may face financial challenges due to the lack of a second income. This can limit their ability to purchase homes, cars, or other necessities, leading to a lower standard of living.
4. Emotional burden: The emotional burden of being single can be significant, particularly for those who are not lifelong singles. Non-lifelong single individuals may experience feelings of insecurity, anxiety, and stress due to their marital status. This can impact their mental health and overall well-being.
5. Limited social support: Single individuals, including non-lifelong singles, may have limited access to social support networks. They may not have a partner to provide emotional support or help with daily tasks, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness.
6. Pressure to conform: Non-lifelong single individuals may face pressure from family, friends, and society at large to conform to traditional marriage norms. This can be challenging, particularly for those who do not identify with these norms or who have different personal goals and values.
7. Lack of role models
