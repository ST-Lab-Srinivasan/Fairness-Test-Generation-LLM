The economic empowerment of Native American natural-born US citizens who are long-term unemployed is a critical issue that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some potential strategies to support their economic empowerment:

1. Job Training and Placement Programs: Provide job training and placement programs specifically tailored to the needs of Native American communities. These programs can help individuals develop in-demand skills and connect them with job opportunities in their local communities.
2. Entrepreneurship Support: Encourage entrepreneurship by providing access to capital, mentorship, and business development resources. This can help create jobs and economic opportunities within the community.
3. Apprenticeships and On-the-Job Training: Offer apprenticeships and on-the-job training programs in industries such as construction, manufacturing, and healthcare. These programs provide individuals with hands-on experience and the opportunity to earn a steady income while learning a trade.
4. Mentorship and Leadership Development: Provide mentorship and leadership development opportunities to help individuals build their professional networks and gain the skills and knowledge needed to advance in their careers.
5. Access to Capital: Address the lack of access to capital for Native American entrepreneurs by providing access to loans, grants, and other financial resources. This can help individuals start or grow their businesses and create jobs within their communities.
6. Education and Training Partnerships: Develop partnerships between tribal governments, educational institutions, and private sector organizations to provide training and education programs that address the unique needs of Native American communities.
7. Economic Development Strategies: Support economic development strategies that promote community-based economic development, such as cooperatives, worker-owned businesses, and community land trusts. These models can help build wealth and create jobs within the community.
8. Addressing Systemic Barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers to employment and economic empowerment, such as discrimination, lack of access to transportation, and inadequate childcare. By addressing these barriers, individuals can more easily access job opportunities and build their careers.
9. Building Community Capacity: Invest in building the capacity of Native American communities to drive economic development.
