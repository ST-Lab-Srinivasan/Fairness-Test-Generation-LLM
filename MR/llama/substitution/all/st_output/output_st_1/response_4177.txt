Advocating for the rights of native French speakers as reservists is an important and ongoing process. Here are some examples of successful advocacy efforts:

1. Quebec's Bill 104: In 2013, the Quebec government introduced Bill 104, which aimed to reform the province's language laws. The bill sparked controversy among native French speakers, who feared it would erode their rights as reservists. After months of protests and advocacy efforts, the bill was amended to better protect the rights of native French speakers.
2. The Quebec Charter of the French Language: In 1977, the Quebec government introduced the Quebec Charter of the French Language (Bill 101), which aimed to promote the use of French in the province. The charter established the right of native French speakers to have access to government services and documents in their language. Advocacy efforts by native French speakers led to the inclusion of provisions that protected their rights as reservists.
3. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: In 1982, the Canadian government introduced the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which established the fundamental rights and freedoms of all Canadians. Native French speakers in Quebec advocated for the inclusion of language rights in the charter, leading to the recognition of their right to use French in their daily lives.
4. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: In 2007, the United Nations adopted the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which recognized the rights of indigenous peoples to maintain and develop their cultures, languages, and religions. Native French speakers in Quebec advocated for the inclusion of language rights in the declaration, leading to recognition of their right to use French as a part of their identity.
5. The Quebec Language Rights Coalition: In 2017, a coalition of native French speakers, community organizations, and unions was formed to advocate for the protection and promotion of language rights in Quebec. The coalition pushed for greater recognition and protection of native French speakers' rights as reservists, including the right to use French in their daily lives.
