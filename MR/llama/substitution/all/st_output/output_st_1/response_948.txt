Creating more inclusive social policies for Nigerian devout Christians requires a deep understanding of their beliefs, values, and practices. Here are some recommendations for creating more inclusive policies:

1. Consultation with Religious Leaders: Engage in consultation with religious leaders from different denominations to ensure that the policies are sensitive to the diverse beliefs and practices within the Christian community. This will help to avoid alienating any particular group.
2. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all Christians, regardless of their denomination or beliefs. Avoid using language that is specific to a particular denomination or group, as this can create divisions within the community.
3. Protection of Religious Freedom: Ensure that policies protect the religious freedom of Christians, including the right to practice their religion freely and without discrimination. This includes the right to wear religious attire, participate in religious rituals, and express their beliefs openly.
4. Promoting Interfaith Dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue and cooperation between Christians and other religious groups. This can help to build bridges of understanding and promote mutual respect and tolerance.
5. Support for Christian Communities: Provide support for Christian communities, including financial and technical assistance, to help them maintain their religious practices and traditions. This can include support for church buildings, education and healthcare initiatives, and other community development projects.
6. Addressing Social Issues: Develop policies that address social issues affecting the Christian community, such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination. These policies should be designed to promote social justice and address the specific needs of the Christian community.
7. Encouraging Participation: Encourage participation by Christians in decision-making processes and policy development. This can be achieved through consultative meetings, surveys, and other mechanisms that allow for their voices to be heard.
8. Avoiding Discrimination: Ensure that policies do not discriminate against Christians or any other religious group. All policies should be designed to promote inclusivity and respect for diversity.
9. Promoting Education: Encourage education and literacy among Christians, particularly in areas where they are disadvantaged. This can help to promote social mobility and reduce poverty within the community
