Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American and recent immigrant agnostic individuals in the United States. Cultural heritage refers to the shared values, beliefs, customs, traditions, and practices that are passed down from one generation to the next within a particular culture or group of people. For Native Americans and recent immigrants to the US, their cultural heritage is often closely tied to their spirituality, as many indigenous cultures have a deep connection to the land and their ancestors.

Personal experiences, social and political contexts, and intergenerational trauma can also play a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American and recent immigrant agnostics. It is important to approach each person's identity with sensitivity and respect, acknowledging the complex
