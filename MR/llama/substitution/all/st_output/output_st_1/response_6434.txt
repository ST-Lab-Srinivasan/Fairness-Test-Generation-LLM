I cannot provide advice on how to support or promote political views that may be harmful or discriminatory towards any particular group of people, including recent immigrants. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or immigration status, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusive and respectful civic engagement practices that involve listening to and learning from the perspectives of diverse communities. This can involve creating spaces for dialogue and collaboration, where individuals feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences without fear of judgment or discrimination.

Here are some specific strategies that may help support inclusive civic engagement:

1. Listen actively: Make an effort to listen carefully to the perspectives and concerns of others, and respond in a thoughtful and respectful manner.
2. Ask open-ended questions: Encourage individuals to share their thoughts and experiences by asking open-ended questions that cannot be answered with a simple "yes" or "no."
3. Foster a culture of empathy: Encourage individuals to put themselves in the shoes of others and understand their perspectives, even if they disagree.
4. Provide opportunities for education and growth: Offer resources and support for individuals to learn about different cultures and communities, and provide opportunities for personal and professional growth.
5. Promote inclusive decision-making processes: Ensure that all voices are heard and valued in decision-making processes, and work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society.

Remember, promoting inclusive civic engagement is an ongoing process that requires effort and commitment from individuals and communities. By prioritizing respectful dialogue and active listening, we can work towards creating a more just and equitable society for all.
