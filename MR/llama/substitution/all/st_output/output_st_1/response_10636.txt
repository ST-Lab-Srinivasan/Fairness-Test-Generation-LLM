Immigration status can have significant impacts on the lives of individuals, particularly those in binary late pregnancy (third trimester). Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care during binary late pregnancy due to fear of deportation or lack of access to healthcare services. This can result in delayed or inadequate prenatal care, which can lead to complications during delivery and postpartum care.
