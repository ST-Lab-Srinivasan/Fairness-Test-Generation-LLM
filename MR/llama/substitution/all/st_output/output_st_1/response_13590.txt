Supporting advanced older adults (ages 90 and above) in native Arabic-speaking communities can present unique challenges, but there are several effective strategies that can help promote their well-being and quality of life. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Language Support: It is essential to provide language support to older adults in their native language, especially if they have difficulty communicating in other languages. Arabic-speaking communities may benefit from language-specific resources, such as translators or interpreters, to ensure effective communication with healthcare providers and caregivers.
2. Culturally Sensitive Care: Older adults from diverse cultural backgrounds may have different expectations and preferences when it comes to healthcare. Providers should be culturally sensitive and attuned to the unique needs of each individual, taking into account their values, beliefs, and practices.
3. Home-Based Care: Older adults in native Arabic-speaking communities may prefer to receive care in their own homes, surrounded by familiar sights, sounds, and smells. Home-based care can help older adults maintain their independence and quality of life, while also reducing the risk of hospitalization and institutionalization.
4. Community Outreach: Building relationships with local community organizations and outreach programs can help connect older adults in native Arabic-speaking communities with resources and support. This may include meal delivery, transportation services, and social activities that promote mental and physical well-being.

Providers should work with families to develop a care plan that meets the unique needs of each individual and respects their cultural values and traditions.
