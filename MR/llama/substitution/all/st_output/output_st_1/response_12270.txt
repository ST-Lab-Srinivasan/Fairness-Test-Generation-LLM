Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities among Long-Time Married Native French Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, especially those who belong to a specific cultural or ethnic group. In France, where the culture is deeply rooted in tradition and history, the impact of cultural heritage on individual identities is particularly pronounced. This study aims to investigate the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of long-time married native French speakers.

Literature Review:
Studies have shown that cultural heritage can shape an individual's identity by providing a sense of belonging and connection to their community, family, and history (Hood, 2013). Cultural heritage can also influence how individuals perceive themselves in relation to others, both within and outside their own group (Gordon, 2005). Furthermore, cultural heritage can be used to justify social hierarchies and power structures, perpetuating inequality and discrimination (Bilge, 2013).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with long-time married native French speakers. Participants will be recruited through purposive sampling, selecting individuals who have been married for at least 10 years and are fluent in French. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for a detailed analysis of participants' responses.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from the interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis, identifying patterns and trends within the data. The themes that emerge from the analysis will be related to the role of cultural heritage in shaping identities among long-time married native French speakers. These themes may include:

1. Sense of belonging and connection to community and family
2. Perceptions of self in relation to others within and outside the group
3. Justification of social hierarchies and power structures
4. Impact on intergroup relationships and interactions
5. Influence on individual identity development and expression

Significance:
This study will contribute to our understanding of how cultural heritage shapes identities among long-time married native French speakers.
