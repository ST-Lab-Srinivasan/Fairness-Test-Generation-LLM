Addressing the specific needs of native Arabic speaker Mexican individuals in healthcare requires a culturally sensitive and linguistically appropriate approach. Here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Provide interpretation services: Ensure that there is an available interpreter or translator who speaks both Spanish and Arabic to assist with communication between healthcare providers and patients who do not speak Spanish fluently. This can include in-person interpretation, video remote interpreting (VRI), or telephone interpretation.
