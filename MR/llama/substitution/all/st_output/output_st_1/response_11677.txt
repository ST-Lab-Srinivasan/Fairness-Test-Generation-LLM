To ensure that the educational needs of beginner English speakers who are not in a relationship are met, here are some strategies that can be implemented:

1. Offer Group Classes: Beginner English learners who are not in a relationship may find it challenging to attend private classes due to various reasons such as location, time, or affordability. To address this challenge, language schools can offer group classes specifically designed for these students. This way, they can learn in a social and interactive environment without feeling isolated or left out.
2. Provide Online Resources: With the rise of online learning platforms, it's now easier than ever to provide educational resources to beginner English speakers who are not in a relationship. Language schools can create video lectures, audio materials, and interactive quizzes that can be accessed through mobile devices or computers. This way, students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule.

For example, partnering with cafes or restaurants to offer language practice sessions while customers wait for their orders.

These events provide a platform for students to practice speaking and listening with native English speakers or other learners. Language schools can invite volunteer tutors or language learners to participate in these events.

These apps can include interactive games, quizzes, and vocabulary builders that cater to different learning styles and levels.
