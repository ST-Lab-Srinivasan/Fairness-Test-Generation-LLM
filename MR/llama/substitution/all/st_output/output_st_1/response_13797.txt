Mexican secular Jewish people face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of recognition: Despite being a significant minority in Mexico, the Jewish community has historically been overlooked and underrepresented in the country's legal framework. This lack of recognition can lead to difficulties in accessing legal rights and protections.
2. Discrimination: Mexican Jews have faced discrimination and prejudice throughout history, which can manifest in various ways in the legal system. For example, there may be biases among legal professionals or judges that can affect the treatment of Jewish cases.
3. Limited access to religious freedom: While Mexico has a constitutional guarantee of religious freedom, in practice, there are limitations on this right for some religious groups, including Jews. For instance, the country's anti-defamation laws do not explicitly protect all religions, and there have been instances of hate speech against Jewish communities.
