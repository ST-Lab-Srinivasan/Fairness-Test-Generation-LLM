Ensuring the educational needs of native Arabic speaker separated students can be challenging, but there are several strategies that educators and administrators can implement to support these students. Here are some recommendations:

1. Provide culturally responsive teaching practices: Native Arabic speakers may face cultural barriers in the classroom, so it's essential to provide culturally responsive teaching practices. This includes incorporating Arabic language and culture into lessons, using teaching methods that are sensitive to their needs, and providing opportunities for students to share their experiences and perspectives.
2. Offer Arabic language support: Many separated students may not be proficient in the dominant language of instruction, so it's important to offer support for learning the language. This can include bilingual education programs, language immersion programs, or hiring interpreters or translators to assist in communication.
3. Create a safe and inclusive learning environment: Separated students may feel marginalized or excluded from the educational environment, so it's important to create a safe and inclusive space for them. This can involve providing opportunities for students to share their experiences and perspectives, promoting cultural exchange and understanding, and addressing any incidents of discrimination or bullying.
4. Provide academic support: Separated students may face additional challenges in the classroom, such as struggling to keep up with coursework or feeling disconnected from the curriculum. Educators can provide academic support by offering extra help sessions, providing individualized learning plans, and incorporating culturally responsive teaching practices into lessons.
5. Involve parents and community members: Parents and community members can play a significant role in supporting separated students. Educators can involve them in the educational process by providing opportunities for parent-teacher conferences, involving them in decision-making processes, and seeking their input on how to best support their children.
6. Address systemic barriers: Separated students may face systemic barriers such as discrimination, inequality, and marginalization. Educators can address these barriers by advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion, such as hiring more diverse staff, providing professional development on cultural competency, and addressing any incidents of discrimination or bias in
