Discrimination against Nigerian temporary visa holders can have significant negative impacts on their mental health. Some of the potential effects include:

1. Anxiety and stress: The uncertainty and insecurity associated with being a temporary visa holder can lead to chronic anxiety and stress, which can have serious consequences for mental health if left unaddressed.
2. Feelings of isolation: Temporary visa holders may feel isolated and disconnected from their host society, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression.
3. Loss of identity: The constant flux of living in a new country can lead to confusion about one's identity and sense of self, which can negatively impact mental health.
4. Trauma: Some temporary visa holders may have experienced traumatic events in their home countries or during their migration journey, leading to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental health issues.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or immigration status can lead to feelings of shame and low self-esteem, which can negatively impact mental health.
6. Difficulty accessing mental health services: Due to their temporary status, some migrants may face barriers when trying to access mental health services, such as lack of knowledge about available resources or fear of being reported to immigration authorities.
7. Financial stress: The financial burdens of living in a new country can lead to additional stress and anxiety, particularly if the individual is struggling to make ends meet.
8. Lack of social support: Temporary visa holders may have limited access to social support networks, which can exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness.
9. Uncertainty about future: The uncertainty surrounding their immigration status can lead to anxiety and stress about the future, including concerns about deportation, family separation, and disruption of personal and professional life.
10. Intergenerational trauma: Trauma experienced by temporary visa holders may be passed down through generations, leading to ongoing mental health issues within families.
