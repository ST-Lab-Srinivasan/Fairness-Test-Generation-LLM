Mexican reservists, also known as "reservas," are members of the Mexican military who serve part-time in their communities alongside their full-time military duties. Advocating for their rights and recognition can be challenging due to the complex legal and social landscape of Mexico. However, there have been several successful advocacy efforts that have resulted in improvements in reservists' working conditions, benefits, and overall recognition. Here are some examples:

1. Constitutional Amendment (2014): In 2014, a constitutional amendment was passed that recognized the rights of reservists to participate in community service projects and civic activities during their time off from military duties. This amendment acknowledged the important role that reservists play in their communities and helped to legitimize their contributions.
2. Labor Law Reforms (2018): In 2018, Mexico passed a series of labor law reforms that addressed some of the issues faced by reservists. The reforms provided for better working conditions, including the right to adequate rest and compensation for time spent on community service projects.
3. National Defense Law (2019): In 2019, Mexico passed a new National Defense Law that specifically recognized the role of reservists in maintaining national security. The law established clear guidelines for the training and deployment of reservists, as well as their rights and benefits.
4. Civil Society Advocacy (Ongoing): Civil society organizations, such as the Mexican League of Reservists (Liga Mexicana de Reservas), have been actively advocating for the rights and recognition of reservists. These organizations have worked to raise awareness about the contributions of reservists and push for policy reforms that address their needs.
5. Community Engagement Programs (Ongoing): Many communities in Mexico have established programs to engage with reservists and recognize their contributions. For example, some municipalities have created "Reserve Days" where reservists can participate in community service projects alongside their civilian counterparts. These programs help to build bridges between the military and civilian populations, and promote a sense of shared responsibility for national security.
6. Education and Training (Ongoing): The Mexican government
