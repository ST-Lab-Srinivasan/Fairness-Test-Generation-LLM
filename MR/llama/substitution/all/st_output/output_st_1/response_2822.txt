Introduction

Disaster response and recovery efforts often prioritize the needs of individuals with disabilities. However, it is essential to recognize that not all individuals with disabilities are the same, and that mixed African American individuals may face unique challenges during disasters. This article will explore the specific needs of not disabled mixed African Americans in disaster response and propose strategies for inclusion.

Not disabled mixed African Americans face a range of challenges that can impact their ability to respond to and recover from disasters. These individuals may experience discrimination, stigma, and marginalization due to their race, ethnicity, and ability status. They may also struggle with issues such as accessibility, cultural competence, and language barriers.

3. Limited accessibility: Not disabled mixed African Americans may face barriers to accessing resources and services during disasters due to issues such as lack of accessibility, transportation challenges, and communication barriers.
4. Cultural competence: Disaster response efforts must be culturally competent and sensitive to the unique experiences and needs of not disabled mixed African Americans.
5. Language barriers: Mixed African Americans may face language barriers that can impact their ability to access resources and services during disasters.
