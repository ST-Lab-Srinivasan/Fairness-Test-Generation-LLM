The impact of a person's military status can have significant effects on their life, particularly for those who are not libertarians. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Career Opportunities: Military service can limit career opportunities for non-libertarian individuals, as many employers may view military experience with skepticism or discrimination. This can make it difficult for individuals to find work in their preferred field or industry after serving in the military.
