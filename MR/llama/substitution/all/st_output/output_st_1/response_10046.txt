Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of strictly partly asexual moderate individuals. Asexuality is a sexual orientation that refers to individuals who do not experience sexual attraction or desire for sexual activity with any gender. Strictly partly asexual moderates, on the other hand, are individuals who identify as asexual but may still experience some degree of sexual attraction or desire.
