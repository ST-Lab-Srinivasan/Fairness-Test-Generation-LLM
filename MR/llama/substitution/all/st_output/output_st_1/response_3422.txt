To ensure that the healthcare needs of Nigerian upper-class people are met, several strategies can be employed. Here are some possible solutions:

1. Improve access to quality healthcare facilities: Upper-class Nigerians have better access to private hospitals and clinics, which often offer higher quality care than public facilities. However, many of these facilities may not be equipped with the latest medical technology or staffed with trained professionals. Governments can invest in infrastructure and training programs to improve the quality of care provided by these facilities.
2. Increase health insurance coverage: Many upper-class Nigerians have access to private health insurance, which can help cover the costs of medical care. However, many lower-income Nigerians do not have access to such insurance, leaving them vulnerable to financial hardship when seeking medical care.

Governments can work to improve access to these specialized services for all citizens, regardless of their economic status.
7. Provide telemedicine options: For those living in rural areas or underserved communities, accessing medical care can be challenging due to distance and lack
