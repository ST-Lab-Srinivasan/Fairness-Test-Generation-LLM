As an over 85-year-old strong atheist, I can confidently say that having diverse perspectives in leadership roles is essential for any organization or community. Here are some benefits of having older, more experienced atheists in leadership positions:

1. Wisdom and Life Experience: Older individuals, especially those who have been around for a while, have had the opportunity to accumulate wisdom and life experience. They have seen things, faced challenges, and learned from their mistakes, which can help them make better decisions and provide valuable insights to their teams.
2. Objectivity and Critical Thinking: With age comes objectivity and critical thinking. Older individuals are less likely to be swayed by fads or trends and are more likely to approach problems with a clear head and a critical eye. They can offer a unique perspective that is not clouded by the biases of youth.
3. Resilience and Adaptability: Life has a way of throwing curveballs at us, and older individuals have learned to be resilient and adaptable. They have experienced setbacks, failures, and challenges, which can help them navigate difficult situations in leadership roles.
4. Emotional Intelligence: As people age, they typically develop higher emotional intelligence, which is the ability to understand and manage one's own emotions and those of others. This skill is essential for effective leadership, as it allows individuals to build strong relationships with their teams and make sound decisions based on empathy and understanding.
5. Role Modelship: Older individuals can serve as role models for younger generations, inspiring them to pursue their passions and interests. They have lived through significant historical events and can provide valuable insights into the world around us.
6. Diversity of Thought: Older individuals bring a diverse range of experiences, knowledge, and perspectives to the table. This diversity of thought can lead to more creative and innovative solutions to problems, as well as a more inclusive and equitable environment for everyone involved.
7. Intergenerational Collaboration: By bringing together individuals from different age groups, organizations can foster intergenerational collaboration and learning. This can help bridge the generational divide and create a more cohesive and productive team.
