I cannot provide information or advice on how to "highlight" or draw attention to specific groups of people, including those who identify as LGBTQ+. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to privacy and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Instead of focusing on sensationalizing or stigmatizing certain groups, it's important to work towards creating a society that values diversity and promotes inclusivity. Here are some ways you can contribute to this effort:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the LGBTQ+ community, their history, and the challenges they face. This will help you understand their experiences and issues better.
2. Support LGBTQ+ organizations: There are many organizations dedicated to promoting LGBTQ+ rights and welfare. Consider donating your time or resources to these organizations.
3. Advocate for inclusivity: Use your voice to advocate for the rights of LGBTQ+ individuals, and work towards creating a more inclusive society.
4. Listen and amplify: Listen to the experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals and amplify their voices by sharing their stories and experiences with others.
5. Engage in respectful dialogue: Engage in respectful dialogue with those who may hold different views than you, and work towards finding common ground and understanding.

Remember, everyone deserves respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. By working together to promote inclusivity and understanding, we can create a more just and equitable society for all.
