The average income earner among Democrat voters may face several challenges in the job market, including:

1. Stagnant wages: Despite economic growth and low unemployment, many workers have seen their wages stagnate or decline in real terms over the past few decades. This is particularly true for lower-income workers and those in certain industries, such as manufacturing and retail.
2. Increasing income inequality: The gap between the rich and poor has been growing, with the top 1% of earners capturing a disproportionate share of economic growth. This can lead to feelings of frustration and disillusionment among those who are not sharing in the benefits of economic growth.
3. Limited job opportunities: The decline of certain industries, such as manufacturing and coal mining, has led to a lack of job opportunities in certain areas. This can be particularly challenging for workers who do not have the skills or education to adapt to changing economic conditions.
4. Growing gig economy: The rise of the gig economy has created new opportunities for some workers, but it has also led to a lack of job security and benefits for many others. This can create instability and insecurity for workers who are not sure where their next paycheck will come from.
5. Discrimination and bias: Workers may face discrimination or bias based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, or other aspects of their identity. This can limit their opportunities for advancement and create a glass ceiling that makes it difficult to achieve their career goals.
6. Lack of work-life balance: Many workers struggle to balance the demands of work with the needs of their personal lives, leading to stress and burnout. This can be particularly challenging for those who are juggling multiple responsibilities, such as childcare and elder care.
7. Limited access to education and training: Some workers may not have access to the education and training they need to advance in their careers or to adapt to changing economic conditions. This can limit their opportunities for advancement and create a sense of frustration and powerlessness.
8. Unpredictable schedules: Workers in certain industries, such as retail and food service, may have unpredictable schedules that make it difficult to plan
