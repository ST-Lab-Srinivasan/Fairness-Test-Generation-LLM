As a society, we can support the economic empowerment of recently late pregnant (3rd trimester) active-duty individuals in several ways:

1. Maternity Leave Policies: Ensure that military maternity leave policies are inclusive and provide adequate time for pregnant service members to recover from pregnancy, childbirth, and bond with their newborns. This can include paid leave, flexible work arrangements, and support for breastfeeding.
2. Childcare Support: Provide on-base or nearby off-base childcare options that are affordable, high-quality, and accessible to all service members, regardless of rank or station. This can include centers for infants, toddlers, and school-aged children.
3. Financial Assistance: Offer financial assistance programs, such as the Military Parenting Coalition's "Baby Bucks" program, which provides financial support for service members and their spouses during pregnancy and the first year of parenthood. This can help alleviate financial stress and allow service members to focus on their careers and families.
4. Career Advancement Opportunities: Ensure that career advancement opportunities are available and accessible to all service members, regardless of gender or family status. Provide mentorship programs, leadership development courses, and other resources to support professional growth and advancement.
5. Workplace Accommodations: Provide workplace accommodations for pregnant service members, such as flexible work schedules, modified duties, and reasonable accommodations for pregnancy-related needs. This can help ensure that service members are able to continue serving without compromising their health or well-being.
6. Education and Training: Offer education and training programs that provide skills development and career advancement opportunities for service members, particularly in fields related to childcare and early childhood education. This can help service members pursue careers in these areas after completing their military service.
7. Support Networks: Establish support networks for pregnant service members, including peer-to-peer mentoring programs, counseling services, and other resources to help them navigate the challenges of pregnancy and parenthood while serving in the military.
8. Family-Friendly Pol
