As a responsible and culturally sensitive AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, deserve equal access to quality healthcare. However, there are specific challenges faced by some Asian professional groups who may not belong to the high-income bracket. These challenges can include:
