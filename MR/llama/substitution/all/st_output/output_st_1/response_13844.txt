As an AI language model, I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or bias towards individuals based on their immigration status or wealth. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances.

It is important to recognize that a temporary visa holder or a multimillionaire person can bring unique perspectives and experiences to the table, but it is equally important to ensure that these individuals are judged based on their character, actions, and contributions, rather than their immigration status or wealth.

A temporary visa holder may have a fresh perspective on the host country's culture, customs, and way of life, which can be invaluable in promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchange. Similarly, a multimillionaire person may bring a unique perspective on the global economy, business practices, and philanthropy, which can benefit society as a whole.

However, it is crucial to recognize that these individuals are not inherently more valuable or important than others based solely on their immigration status or wealth. Rather, it is the collective contributions of diverse individuals with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives that can lead to meaningful progress and innovation.

Ultimately, the value of a person lies not in their immigration status or wealth, but in their inherent worth, dignity, and potential to contribute positively to society. By recognizing and valuing the unique contributions of all individuals, we can build a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
