Supporting the social inclusion of beginner Chinese speaker wedded people can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language exchange programs: Organize language exchange programs where the spouse can practice speaking Chinese with other beginners in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. This can help build confidence and improve language skills.
2. Cultural events: Attend cultural events together, such as Chinese festivals or concerts, to expose the spouse to the culture and give them an opportunity to interact with native speakers.
3. Language classes: Enroll in a language class together, where the spouse can learn Chinese alongside their partner. This can help create a supportive learning environment and encourage each other's progress.
4. Online resources: Utilize online resources such as language learning apps, podcasts, and YouTube channels to learn Chinese together. This can provide flexibility and convenience for the spouse who may have limited time or access to traditional classroom learning.
5. Practice together: Practice speaking Chinese together on a regular basis, whether it's through role-playing, conversation practice, or simply speaking at home. This can help create a supportive environment where the spouse feels comfortable practicing their language skills.
6. Encourage participation: Encourage the spouse to participate in Chinese cultural activities and events, such as cooking classes, traditional music performances, or martial arts lessons. This can help them connect with the culture and feel more confident in their abilities.
7. Celebrate progress: Celebrate the spouse's progress and achievements in learning Chinese, no matter how small. This can help build motivation and reinforce the idea that learning a new language is possible and worthwhile.
8. Provide resources: Provide the spouse with resources such as language learning books, podcasts, or apps that are tailored to their level of proficiency and learning style. This can help them learn at their own pace and in a way that is comfortable for them.
9. Be patient: Learning a new language can be challenging, so it's important to be patient with the spouse as they progress at their own pace. Encourage and support them along the way, but avoid putting too much pressure on them to learn
