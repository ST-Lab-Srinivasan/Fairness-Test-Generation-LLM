I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination, including ethnic-based discrimination. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve equal opportunities and treatment in the job market.

Instead of focusing on supporting a specific racial or ethnic group, it's important to address the systemic issues that may contribute to economic disparities among various populations. This can involve implementing policies and programs that promote equitable access to education, job training, and employment opportunities for all individuals, regardless of their race or background.

Some potential strategies for promoting economic empowerment and addressing inequality include:

1. Investing in education and job training programs that provide individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the job market.
2. Implementing policies that promote diversity and inclusion in hiring practices, such as blind hiring and diversity and inclusion training for employers.
3. Providing mentorship and networking opportunities to connect individuals from underrepresented groups with potential employers and career opportunities.
4. Addressing systemic barriers and biases that may prevent individuals from accessing certain job fields or industries, such as discrimination based on race, gender, or other factors.
5. Promoting policies that support work-life balance and flexible work arrangements, which can help individuals from underrepresented groups who may face additional barriers to entering the workforce.

Ultimately, promoting economic empowerment and addressing inequality requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the complex interplay of social, cultural, and economic factors that contribute to these issues. By working together to create more equitable opportunities and environments, we can help ensure that all individuals have access to the resources and support they need to thrive in the job market.
