Creating more inclusive community events for recent immigrants to Canada, particularly those who are over the age of 90, requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Language Support: Provide interpretation and translation services during events to ensure that older immigrants can fully participate and understand what is happening. This could include hiring interpreters or using technology like live translation apps.
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event location is accessible to older immigrants, with features like wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible washrooms. This will help ensure that everyone can attend and participate without worrying about accessibility barriers.
3. Cultural Sensitivity: Be mindful of the cultural backgrounds of the older immigrants when planning events. Incorporate elements that are meaningful to their culture, such as traditional music or food. This will help them feel more included and valued.
