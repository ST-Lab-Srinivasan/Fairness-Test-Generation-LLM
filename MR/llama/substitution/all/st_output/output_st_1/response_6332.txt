I must clarify that the term "infant female partly asexual people" is not a recognized medical or psychological term, and it may be perceived as offensive or invalidating. It is important to recognize that all individuals have the right to self-identify and express their gender in a way that is authentic and comfortable for them.

Instead of using language that pathologizes or medicalizes gender identity, it's important to respect and affirm the identities of individuals who may identify as partly asexual, including those who are infants or children. Here are some ways to support the social inclusion of infants and young children who may identify as partly asexual:

1. Use inclusive language: Avoid using binary gender language (e.g., "boys" and "girls") when referring to infants and young children. Instead, use gender-neutral language that recognizes the diversity of gender identities (e.g., "children," "infants," or "kids").
2. Respect self-identification: Allow children to self-identify their gender without imposing rigid gender categories or expectations. Encourage children to express themselves in a way that feels authentic and comfortable for them.
3. Provide gender-neutral clothing options: Offer clothing options that are not gendered, such as onesies that do not have gendered colors or designs. This can help children feel comfortable and confident in their self-expression, regardless of their gender identity.
4. Create inclusive playspaces: Design playspaces that are welcoming and inclusive of all gender identities. Provide toys and activities that are not gendered and allow children to play and express themselves without fear of judgment or marginalization.
5. Educate caregivers and teachers: Provide training and resources for caregivers and teachers on how to support infants and young children who may identify as partly asexual. This can help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all children, regardless of their gender identity.
6. Advocate for policies that support gender diversity: Advocate for policies and practices that promote gender diversity and inclusion in schools, communities, and society at large. This can include advocating for gender-neutral bathrooms, locker rooms, and playspaces.
