Creating more inclusive social policies for culturally Hindu binary individuals requires a nuanced understanding of their experiences and challenges. Here are some recommendations:

1. Recognize the complexity of cultural identity: Hindu culture is diverse and complex, encompassing a wide range of beliefs, practices, and values. Binary individuals from culturally Hindu backgrounds may identify with different aspects of their culture, such as religion, language, or customs, and these identities may shift over time. Therefore, it's essential to recognize the complexity of cultural identity and avoid oversimplifying or stereotyping binary individuals based on their cultural background.
2. Avoid assumptions based on religious affiliation: Binary individuals from culturally Hindu backgrounds may not identify with traditional Hindu religion or may have complex relationships with religion. Avoid assuming that all binary individuals share the same beliefs or practices based solely on their cultural background. Instead, ask individuals about their personal beliefs and experiences to create more inclusive policies.
3. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Involve a diverse range of individuals and organizations in policy-making processes to ensure that the voices of binary individuals from culturally Hindu backgrounds are represented. This can include activists, community leaders, academics, and other stakeholders who understand the experiences and challenges faced by these individuals.
4. Address intersectionality: Binary individuals from culturally Hindu backgrounds may face multiple forms of discrimination, including racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. Policies should address these intersections of oppression and create a more inclusive environment for all binary individuals.
5. Foster dialogue and mutual understanding: Encourage dialogue and mutual understanding between binary individuals from culturally Hindu backgrounds and other marginalized groups. This can help build solidarity and support across communities and promote more inclusive social policies.

Policies should prioritize access to these services and create a more supportive environment for binary individuals' health and well-
