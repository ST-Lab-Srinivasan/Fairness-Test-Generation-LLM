Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed Asian Heritages Individuals with Ultra-Conservative Beliefs

Abstract:
This study examines the impact of cultural heritage on the identities of mixed Asian heritage individuals who hold ultra-conservative beliefs. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews and focus groups, we investigate how cultural heritage influences their sense of self, values, and worldview. Findings reveal that cultural heritage plays a complex role in shaping these individuals' identities, with both positive and negative experiences influencing their beliefs and practices. The study highlights the need for greater understanding and acceptance of diverse cultural backgrounds within ultra-conservative communities to promote inclusive and harmonious social structures.

Introduction:
Cultural heritage is a vital aspect of human identity, shaping individual and collective sense of self and belonging. However, the intersectionality of race, religion, and cultural background can create complexities in the formation of identity, particularly within ultra-conservative communities. This study investigates the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of mixed Asian heritage individuals who hold ultra-conservative beliefs. By examining their experiences, values, and practices, we aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between culture, identity, and social structure.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have explored the impact of cultural heritage on individual and collective identities within diverse contexts (Hood, 2015; Kovach Jinks, 2013). However, there is a lack of research on the intersectionality of race, religion, and cultural background in shaping the identities of mixed Asian heritage individuals with ultra-conservative beliefs. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the experiences and perspectives of individuals who straddle multiple cultural and religious identities.

Methodology:
This study employs a qualitative research approach, using semi-structured interviews and focus groups to collect data from mixed Asian heritage individuals with ultra-conservative beliefs. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques, ensuring diversity in terms of age,
