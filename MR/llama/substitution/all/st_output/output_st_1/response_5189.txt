As a beginner French speaker in your late 30s, you may find it challenging to participate in cultural celebrations that are predominantly French-speaking. However, there are several steps you can take to create more inclusive cultural celebrations for individuals like you:

1. Research and learn about French culture: Start by learning about the main cultural events and traditions in France. This will help you understand what to expect during cultural celebrations and how to participate. You can find plenty of information online or through books from your local library.
2. Look for bilingual events: Many cities have bilingual events that cater to non-French speakers. These events often provide translation services or simultaneous interpretation, making it easier for you to follow and participate in the celebrations. Check local event calendars or expat groups for bilingual events in your area.
3. Join a language exchange group: Language exchange groups are a great way to meet other beginners like yourself who want to practice their French skills. You can share cultural knowledge and practices with each other, and you may even find someone who can help you navigate cultural celebrations. Look for local language exchange groups or join online communities.
4. Invite French speakers to share their culture: Reach out to your French-speaking friends or colleagues and invite them to share their cultural traditions with you. You could host a dinner party or organize a small gathering where they can teach you about French customs and practices. This will give you a chance to learn more about French culture in a relaxed setting.
5. Create your own cultural celebrations: If you're unable to find inclusive events, consider creating your own cultural celebrations that cater to beginners like yourself. You could organize a potluck dinner where everyone brings a traditional dish from their country of origin, or host a movie night where you watch a French film with English subtitles. This will give you an opportunity to share your culture and language skills with others while also learning more about French traditions.
6. Use visual aids: If you're having trouble understanding spoken French during cultural celebrations, try using visual aids like pictures or videos to help you follow along. You could also use apps like Duolingo or Babbel to learn key phrases and vocabulary
