As a native French speaker and beginner Spanish speaker, there may be several challenges that you may face when navigating the legal system in a country where Spanish is the dominant language. Here are some of the common challenges:

Legal terms and concepts can be difficult to understand, especially when explained in a language that is not your native tongue.
