Creating more inclusive community events for native Chinese speakers aged over 90 years old (or over 85) requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event venue is accessible to elderly individuals, with features such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and accessible restrooms. Provide audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for participants who are deaf or hard of hearing.
2. Cultural sensitivity: Be mindful of cultural differences and tailor the event to meet the needs of this age group. For example, some elderly individuals may feel uncomfortable in loud or crowded environments. Consider hosting smaller, more intimate events with fewer attendees.
3. Language support: Provide translation services for participants who may not speak the dominant language of the event. This can include providing interpreters, translating materials, or using technology such as video remote interpreting (VRI) services.
4. Activity options: Offer a variety of activities that cater to different interests and abilities. For example, consider including chair yoga, tai chi, or other low-impact exercises that are suitable for elderly individuals.
5. Socialization opportunities: Create opportunities for participants to socialize and connect with others. This can include group activities, games, or simply providing a relaxed atmosphere where attendees can mingle and make new friends.
6. Technology integration: Leverage technology to enhance the event experience. For example, use tablets or other devices to provide interactive experiences, such as virtual tours of cultural attractions or historical sites.
7. Volunteer support: Recruit volunteers who are fluent in the language and culture of the elderly attendees. These volunteers can help facilitate activities, provide support, and act as cultural ambassadors.
8. Health and wellness: Offer health and wellness-related activities, such as blood pressure checks, nutrition counseling, or stress management workshops. This can help promote overall health and wellbeing among attendees.
9. Food and beverage options: Provide a variety of food and beverage options that cater to the dietary needs and preferences of elderly individuals. Ensure that the menu includes options
