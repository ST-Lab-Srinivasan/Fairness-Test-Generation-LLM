Creating more inclusive social policies for natural-born Indian citizen monastic Buddhist individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the unique challenges and opportunities facing this community. Here are some recommendations:

1. Recognition of Monastic Status: The first step is to recognize the monastic status of these individuals in Indian law. This can be achieved by including provisions in the Citizenship Act or other relevant laws that acknowledge the existence of monastic communities and their rights and privileges.
2. Protection of Religious Freedom: Monks and nuns should be allowed to practice their religion freely without any interference from the state or any other authority. This includes the right to observe their religious rituals, wear traditional attire, and follow their own spiritual practices.
3. Access to Education: Monastic Buddhist individuals should have access to education that is tailored to their needs. This can include vocational training in areas such as meditation, chanting, and scripture study, as well as academic education in subjects relevant to their spiritual pursuits.
4. Healthcare: Monastic Buddhist individuals should have access to quality healthcare that addresses their unique medical needs. This can include access to traditional medicine and alternative therapies that are aligned with their spiritual beliefs.
5. Social Security: Monastic Buddhist individuals should be eligible for social security benefits, including pensions, health insurance, and other forms of support that address their economic needs.
6. Housing and Land Rights: Monastic Buddhist communities should have access to affordable housing and land rights that ensure their continued existence and autonomy. This can include the right to purchase or lease land for religious purposes, as well as the right to maintain and manage their own properties.
7. Employment Opportunities: Monastic Buddhist individuals should have access to employment opportunities that align with their skills and interests. This can include jobs in monasteries, temples, and other religious institutions, as well as opportunities for spiritual mentorship and guidance.
8. Cultural Preservation: Monastic Buddhist communities should be encouraged to preserve their cultural heritage and traditions. This can include the promotion of traditional music, dance, art, and literature, as well as the preservation of historical sites and artifacts that are significant to their spiritual practices.
