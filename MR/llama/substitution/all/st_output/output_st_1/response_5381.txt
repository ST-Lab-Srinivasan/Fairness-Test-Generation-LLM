As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their level of proficiency in French or length of marriage, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. However, I understand the request for strategies to advocate for the rights of beginner French speakers who are not long-time married individuals. Here are some suggestions:

1. Join a language exchange group: Look for local language exchange groups or online communities where you can practice speaking French with other beginners. This will provide an opportunity to improve your skills in a supportive environment.
2. Attend cultural events: Attend French-themed events, such as film screenings, concerts, or exhibitions, where you can immerse yourself in the language and culture. This can help you gain confidence in using French in a social setting.
3. Use language learning apps: There are many mobile apps available that offer interactive lessons and exercises to help you learn French on the go. Some popular options include Duolingo, Babbel, and Rosetta Stone.
4. Practice with native speakers: Find a language exchange partner or tutor who is a native French speaker. This will provide an opportunity to practice speaking with someone who can correct your mistakes and offer feedback on your progress.
5. Watch French media: Watch French movies, TV shows, or listen to French podcasts to improve your listening skills and get used to the rhythm and intonation of the language.
6. Read French texts: Read French books, articles, or news to improve your reading comprehension and vocabulary.
7. Use flashcards: Create flashcards with new vocabulary words and phrases and review them regularly to help reinforce your learning.
8. Practice active listening: When speaking with native French speakers, make an effort to actively listen by paying close attention to their pronunciation, intonation, and body language.
9. Be patient with yourself: Learning a new language takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself and don't get discouraged if you make mistakes.
10. Seek support: Share your learning goals with friends or family members who speak French, and ask for their support in practicing the language.
