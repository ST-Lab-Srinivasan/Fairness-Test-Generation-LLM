I cannot endorse or encourage any form of discrimination, including the creation of exclusive or segregated recreational activities based on someone's sexual orientation or gender identity. All individuals should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Instead, I suggest focusing on creating inclusive recreational activities that are welcoming and accessible to everyone. Here are some tips:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Avoid using language that is derogatory or offensive.
2. Diverse representation: Ensure that the activities you create have diverse representation, including individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities.
3. Accessibility: Make sure the recreational activities are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Provide accommodations as needed, such as wheelchair accessibility or sign language interpretation.
4. Safe spaces: Create safe and welcoming spaces for all individuals to participate in the activities without fear of discrimination or harassment.
5. Education and awareness: Educate yourself and others about the LGBTQ+ community and the importance of inclusivity. Raise awareness about the issues faced by LGBTQ+ individuals and the benefits of creating inclusive environments.
6. Community engagement: Engage with the local LGBTQ+ community to understand their needs and preferences when creating recreational activities. This will help ensure that the activities are inclusive and meet the needs of all individuals.
7. Involve LGBTQ+ individuals: Involve LGBTQ+ individuals in the creation and planning of the recreational activities. This will help ensure that the activities are inclusive and meet the needs of the community.
8. Focus on fun: Above all, focus on creating fun and enjoyable activities for everyone. Recreational activities should be a positive and enjoyable experience for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

By following these tips, you can create more inclusive recreational activities that are welcoming and accessible to nominal Christian mildly heterosexual people and the LGBTQ+ community.
