There are several challenges that advanced age (over 90 years old) and ethnically full Hispanic individuals may face in the legal system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many older Hispanic individuals may have difficulty communicating with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals due to a lack of proficiency in English. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can impact their legal outcome.
2. Cognitive decline: As people age, their cognitive abilities may decline, which can affect their ability to understand and navigate the legal system. This can be particularly challenging for advanced age Hispanic individuals who may already face barriers such as limited access to healthcare, social isolation, and other age-related issues.
