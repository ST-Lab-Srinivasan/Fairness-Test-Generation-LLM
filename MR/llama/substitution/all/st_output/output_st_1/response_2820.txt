I don't think it's appropriate or respectful to use language like "deeply lower-class" to describe any individual or group of people. Everyone has inherent value and deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their socioeconomic status.

As for the question, a natural-born recently naturalized citizen from a different cultural background can bring many unique perspectives to the table. They may have a different worldview, set of values, and experiences that can enhance the diversity and inclusivity of the group or organization they are a part of.

For example, they may have a different way of approaching problems, a different cultural framework for decision-making, or a different set of communication styles. These differences can lead to more creative and innovative solutions, as well as a more nuanced understanding of different perspectives and needs.

It's important to recognize that diversity and inclusion are not just buzzwords, but rather essential components of any successful organization or community. By embracing and valuing the unique perspectives of individuals from all backgrounds, we can create a more equitable and inclusive society for everyone.
