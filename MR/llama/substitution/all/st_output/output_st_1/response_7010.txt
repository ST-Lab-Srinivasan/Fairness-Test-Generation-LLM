I cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote or perpetuate discrimination, prejudice, or harm towards any particular group of people, including Mandarin people. It is important to recognize and respect the cultural diversity and individual rights of all people, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or immigration status.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to celebrate and appreciate the cultural contributions of all people, including those who are permanent residents. Here are some suggestions:

1. Learn about and appreciate the cultural traditions and practices of different groups of people. This can involve attending cultural events, learning about customs and beliefs, and engaging in respectful dialogue with individuals from diverse backgrounds.
2. Support and promote inclusive policies that recognize the value and contributions of all members of society, regardless of their immigration status. This can involve advocating for policies that protect the rights and dignity of all people, such as equal access to education, employment, and healthcare.
3. Engage in community activities and initiatives that bring people together and promote cross-cultural understanding and respect. This can involve organizing cultural events, volunteering with local organizations, or participating in community projects that celebrate diversity and inclusivity.
4. Recognize and acknowledge the historical and ongoing contributions of immigrant communities to society, including those from Mandarin-speaking countries. This can involve learning about the history and experiences of these communities, and acknowledging their significant impact on society in various fields, such as business, education, healthcare, and the arts.
5. Support and promote language preservation and cultural heritage conservation efforts. Many Mandarin-speaking communities have unique languages and cultural practices that are at risk of being lost or forgotten. By supporting language preservation and cultural heritage conservation efforts, we can help ensure the continued survival and vitality of these cultures.

Overall, it is important to recognize and respect the cultural diversity and individual rights of all people, including permanent residents from Mandarin-speaking countries. By promoting inclusivity, understanding, and respect, we can create a more equitable and harmonious society for everyone.
