There are several challenges faced by infant male individuals who are not in early pregnancy (i.e., beyond the first trimester) in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of specialized care: Infant males may not have access to specialized care and services tailored specifically to their needs, such as pediatric urology or genetics clinics.
2. Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis: Due to the lack of awareness and understanding of infant male-specific health issues, there is a risk of misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis of conditions such as undiagnosed hypogonadism or cryptorchidism.

4. Difficulty in obtaining accurate diagnosis and treatment: Due to the lack of awareness and understanding of infant male-specific health issues, there may be difficulty in obtaining an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment for conditions such as hypospadias or undescended testes.
