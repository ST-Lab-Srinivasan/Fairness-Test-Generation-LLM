Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Cultural sensitivity training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for program staff and volunteers to help them understand the unique experiences and challenges faced by ethnically full African American learners. This training can include workshops on unconscious bias, microaggressions, and cultural humility.
2. Inclusive language policies: Develop inclusive language policies that recognize and value the diversity of learners' backgrounds and experiences. Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all cultures, and avoid language that perpetuates stereotypes or marginalizes certain groups.
3. Representation matter: Ensure that the cultural programs are representative of the learners' backgrounds and experiences. This can be achieved by incorporating diverse materials, resources, and teaching methods that reflect the learners' cultures and identities.
4. Safe space creation: Create a safe and inclusive learning environment where learners feel comfortable sharing their experiences and perspectives. Encourage respectful dialogue and active listening, and provide opportunities for learners to connect with one another across cultural boundaries.
5. Adaptable teaching methods: Use adaptable teaching methods that can accommodate different learning styles and abilities. Be flexible and willing to adjust teaching methods to meet the needs of individual learners, taking into account their cultural backgrounds and experiences.
6. Collaboration with community organizations: Partner with community organizations that serve ethnically full African American populations to reach a broader audience and provide more culturally responsive programming. This can include collaborations with African American cultural centers, churches, and other community-based organizations.
7. Learner-centered approach: Take a learner-centered approach to program design and implementation. Involve learners in the planning and decision-making process to ensure that the programs meet their needs and are responsive to their interests and preferences.
8. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may hinder access to cultural programs, such as transportation issues or lack of access to technology. Provide flexible scheduling options and ensure that learners have equal access to resources and opportunities.
