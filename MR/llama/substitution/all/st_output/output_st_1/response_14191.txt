Navigating multiple cultural spaces: Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals often find themselves navigating multiple cultural spaces, such as their home culture, their ethnic culture, and their national culture.

For example, an individual may identify as a woman, a Latina, a queer person, and a religious minority, all of which intersect and shape their sense of self.
