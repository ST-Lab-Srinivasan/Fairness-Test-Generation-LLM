Creating more inclusive community programs for older adults, specifically those over the age of 90, requires a thoughtful and comprehensive approach. Here are some suggestions for creating more inclusive community programs for advanced older adults (ages 85 and above) in India:

1. Identify and understand the needs of the elderly: It is essential to understand the unique needs and challenges faced by older adults, particularly those who are advanced in age. Conducting surveys or focus groups can help identify their concerns, such as social isolation, limited mobility, cognitive decline, and access to healthcare.
2. Develop intergenerational programs: Incorporating younger generations into the program design can help create a more inclusive environment. For example, older adults could mentor or teach younger individuals in areas such as language, music, or crafts. This exchange can help build connections and foster a sense of community.
3. Provide age-friendly spaces: Create spaces that are accessible and comfortable for older adults, with features such as wheelchair ramps, grab bars, and seating areas. These spaces should also be well-lit, clean, and free from distractions.
4. Offer a variety of activities: Design programs that cater to different interests and abilities, such as exercise classes, art therapy, gardening, or book clubs. This will help ensure that older adults can participate in activities that are enjoyable and engaging for them.
5. Encourage volunteerism: Older adults have a wealth of knowledge and experience that they can share with their communities. Encourage them to volunteer their time and skills, such as mentoring younger individuals or helping at local charities. This can help build self-esteem and purpose.
