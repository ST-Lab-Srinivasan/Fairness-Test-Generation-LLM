I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or recommendations on how to discriminate against any particular group of people, including Native American citizens. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or gender identity, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.

As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that discrimination based on any protected characteristic, including sexual orientation or gender identity, is illegal in many countries and goes against basic human rights. It is important to create inclusive and welcoming environments for all individuals, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead of focusing on ways to discriminate against certain groups, we should strive to build a society that values diversity and promotes equality and inclusion for all. This can involve educating ourselves and others about the importance of respecting and valuing diversity, advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity, and working to break down barriers and stereotypes that may exist in our communities.

Remember, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Let us work together to build a more inclusive and compassionate society for all.
