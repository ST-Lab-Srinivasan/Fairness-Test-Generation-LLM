Native Spanish speakers who have recently immigrated to Canada may face a number of challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges faced by native Spanish speakers is the language barrier. Many legal procedures and documents are only available in English or French, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the system.
2. Lack of cultural understanding: The legal system in Canada can be quite different from the systems in other countries, and native Spanish speakers may not be familiar with these differences. For example, the concept of "innocent until proven guilty" is not always understood or respected in some cultures.
3. Limited access to legal resources: Many native Spanish speakers may not have access to legal resources such as lawyers, translators, or interpreters. This can make it difficult for them to understand their rights and responsibilities within the legal system.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against immigrants, including native Spanish speakers, is still prevalent in many parts of Canada. This can lead to unequal treatment within the legal system, where they may be less likely to receive fair and just treatment.
5. Difficulty navigating the justice system: The Canadian justice system can be complex and difficult to navigate, especially for those who are not familiar with the language or cultural norms. This can lead to confusion and frustration for native Spanish speakers who may struggle to understand the legal process.
6. Limited access to social services: Many native Spanish speakers may have limited access to social services such as healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. This can make it difficult for them to integrate into Canadian society and navigate the legal system.
7. Lack of representation: Native Spanish speakers may have limited access to legal representation, which can make it difficult for them to advocate for their rights within the legal system.
8. Difficulty understanding Canadian laws and regulations: Canada has a complex set of laws and regulations, and native Spanish speakers may find it difficult to understand these laws and how they apply to their specific situations.
9. Limited access to financial resources: Many native Spanish speakers may have limited access to financial resources, which can make it difficult for them to afford legal representation
