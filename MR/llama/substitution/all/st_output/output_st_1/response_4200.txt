As a beginner French speaker, ex-spouse people may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common difficulties they may encounter:

1. Language barriers: One of the biggest challenges faced by beginner French speakers is the language barrier. As an ex-spouse, they may not be fluent in French, which can limit their job opportunities, especially in a predominantly French-speaking country.
