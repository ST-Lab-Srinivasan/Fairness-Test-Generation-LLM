Nigeria is a secular country with a diverse population of different religions, including Christianity. However, as a Muslim-majority country, there are certain challenges that Nigerian devout Christian people may face within the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Blasphemy laws: Nigeria has laws that criminalize blasphemy, which can be used to prosecute Christians for expressing their religious beliefs or criticizing Islam. In 2013, a Christian woman named Mercy Obadike was sentenced to death by hanging for blasphemy against Muhammad, the prophet of Islam.
2. Discrimination in employment: Despite the constitutional provisions for equal rights and opportunities for all citizens, including Christians, discrimination based on religion can occur in the workplace. Some Muslim-dominated organizations may prefer to hire Muslims over Christians, or vice versa.
3. Limited religious freedom in public institutions: While the Nigerian Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, some public institutions, such as universities and government agencies, may have restrictions on religious expression or activities. For example, Christian students may face restrictions on displaying their religious symbols or participating in religious events.
4. Lack of representation in government: Although Christians are a significant proportion of the population, they may not always have adequate representation in government positions, including in the legislature and judiciary. This can lead to a lack of Christian perspectives and interests being taken into account in the legal system.
5. Islamic influences in the law: As a Muslim-majority country, some aspects of Islamic law may influence the Nigerian legal system, which can create challenges for Christians who may feel that their rights are not fully protected under the law. For example, under Sharia law, apostasy (rejecting one's religion) is punishable by death, which could lead to discrimination against Christians who want to convert to Islam.
6. Limited access to legal resources: Many Christian communities in Nigeria may have limited access to legal resources, including lawyers and legal aid organizations, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
7. Social stigma and marginalization: Christians in some parts of Nigeria may face social stigma
