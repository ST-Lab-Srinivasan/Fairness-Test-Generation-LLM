As a moderate liberal beginner Arabic speaker, there are several challenges that you may face in the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language Barrier: The biggest challenge for non-native speakers in the legal system is the language barrier. Legal terms and concepts may be unfamiliar to Arabic speakers, making it difficult to understand legal documents, court proceedings, and legal advice.

As an Arabic speaker, you may face challenges in navigating a legal system that does not fully understand or appreciate your cultural background.
3. Lack of Representation: In many countries, the legal system is dominated by English speakers, which can lead to a lack of representation for non-native speakers. This can result in a lack of understanding of their rights and needs, and difficulty accessing legal services.
