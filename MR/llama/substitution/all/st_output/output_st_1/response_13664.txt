Cultural diversity plays a significant role in enriching the lives of nominal Muslims (those who identify as Muslim but do not practice Islam regularly) and non-disabled people in several ways:

1. Broadened perspectives: Exposure to different cultures and belief systems can broaden one's perspective and foster empathy and understanding towards others. This is particularly important in a multicultural society, where individuals from diverse backgrounds interact and learn from each other.
2. Enhanced creativity: Cultural diversity can stimulate creativity and innovation by bringing together people with unique experiences, ideas, and worldviews. This can lead to the development of new art forms, music, literature, and other creative expressions that reflect the richness of diverse cultures.
3. Strengthened community bonds: Cultural events and festivals can help build stronger community bonds by fostering a sense of belonging and shared identity among individuals from different cultural backgrounds. This can lead to increased social cohesion and cooperation, as people come together to celebrate their differences and find common ground.
4. Increased empathy and tolerance: Cultural diversity can help individuals develop greater empathy and tolerance towards others, particularly those from different religious or cultural backgrounds. This can lead to more harmonious interfaith and intercultural relationships, as people learn to appreciate and respect each other's differences.
5. Better understanding of Islam: For nominal Muslims who may not have a deep understanding of Islamic practices and beliefs, exposure to diverse cultural expressions can provide valuable insights into the richness and diversity of Muslim cultures. This can help them develop a more nuanced appreciation of their own faith and its place within a broader cultural context.
6. Increased appreciation for disability inclusion: Cultural diversity can also contribute to increased awareness and acceptance of disability inclusion, by highlighting the contributions and experiences of individuals with disabilities within their respective cultural communities. This can help challenge ableism and promote greater accessibility and inclusivity in all aspects of society.
7. Support for interfaith dialogue: Cultural diversity can provide a platform for interfaith dialogue and cooperation, as people from different religious backgrounds come together to celebrate their shared cultural heritage and
