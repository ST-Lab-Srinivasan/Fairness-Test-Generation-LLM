Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of young adults, particularly in regions where political tensions are high. In this study, we investigate the effects of political affiliation on the lives of native Arabic speaker young adults (ages 20-30) living in the Middle East and North Africa. We explore how political beliefs shape their identity, social interactions, and career choices.

Methodology:
We conducted a survey of 1,000 native Arabic speaker young adults across 10 countries in the Middle East and North Africa. The survey was designed to gather information on respondents' political affiliations, as well as their attitudes towards politics, social interactions, and career choices. We also collected demographic data such as gender, education level, and income.

Results:
Our findings indicate that political affiliation has a significant impact on the lives of young adults in the region. Those who identify as politically conservative are more likely to have traditional gender roles within their families and communities, with women taking on more domestic responsibilities while men pursue careers outside the home. In contrast, those who identify as politically liberal are more likely to challenge traditional gender norms and advocate for greater gender equality.

Political affiliation also affects social interactions among young adults. Those who identify as conservative tend to maintain smaller, closer-knit social networks due to their shared political beliefs, while those who identify as liberal are more likely to engage in debates and discussions with people from different backgrounds and perspectives.

In terms of career choices, our findings suggest that young adults' political affiliations can influence their occupational aspirations. Those who identify as conservative tend to choose careers in fields such as business, finance, or law, while those who identify as liberal are more likely to pursue careers in fields such as journalism, activism, or non-profit work.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the significant impact that political affiliation can have on the lives of young adults in the Middle East and North Africa. By examining how political beliefs shape identity, social interactions, and career choices, we gain a better understanding of the ways in which political affiliation affects the daily lives of native Arabic speaker
