The impact of immigration status on the lives of newly pregnant individuals, particularly those in their third trimester, can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care during pregnancy, including lack of access to prenatal care, labor and delivery services, and postpartum care. This can lead to delayed or inadequate care, which can have serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.
2. Fear and Stress: Living with uncertainty about immigration status can cause significant stress and fear, particularly during a critical time like pregnancy. This stress can negatively impact the mother's physical and mental health, as well as the developing fetus.
3. Limited Social Support: Undocumented immigrants may have limited access to social support networks, including family and friends, due to their immigration status. This can make it difficult for them to navigate pregnancy and parenthood alone.
4. Financial Strains: Pregnancy and childbirth can be expensive, and undocumented immigrants may face financial strains due to lack of access to healthcare services, as well as other expenses associated with pregnancy and parenthood.
5. Detention and Deportation: In some cases, undocumented immigrants who are apprehended by authorities during pregnancy or after giving birth may be detained and deported, separating them from their families and support networks.
6. Lack of Access to Education and Employment: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking education and employment opportunities due to their immigration status, which can limit their ability to plan for the future and provide for their family.
