Advocating for the rights of older adults, particularly those living just above the poverty line and over the age of 90, requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges. Here are some effective ways to advocate for their rights:

1. Raise awareness: Educate the public about the issues faced by older adults, such as social isolation, limited access to healthcare, and financial insecurity. Use media campaigns, community events, and other platforms to raise awareness and build empathy.
2. Advocate for policies that support aging populations: Encourage policymakers to implement policies that address the needs of older adults, such as affordable housing options, transportation services, and healthcare reform.
3. Provide supportive services: Offer services that help older adults maintain their independence, such as home repair and maintenance, transportation, and meal delivery. These services can help alleviate the burden of daily tasks and improve overall quality of life.
4. Promote age-friendly communities: Encourage urban planning and design that prioritizes accessibility and inclusivity for older adults. This can include things like wider sidewalks, accessible public transportation, and community spaces that are welcoming to people of all ages.
5. Advocate for intergenerational programs: Develop programs that bring together younger and older generations, fostering connections and mutual understanding. Examples include mentorship programs, youth-led service projects, and cross-generational volunteer opportunities.
6. Support research and innovation: Encourage research into aging-related issues and innovative solutions to improve the well-being of older adults. This can include funding for age-related disease research, technological advancements in healthcare, and policy analysis.
7. Engage with lawmakers: Build relationships with elected officials and advocate for policies that support the rights of older adults. Encourage policymakers to prioritize aging issues and allocate resources accordingly.
8. Empower older adults: Provide opportunities for older adults to voice their opinions and participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives. This can include training programs for older adults to develop leadership skills and engage in community activism.
