Mexican agnostic people may face several challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of recognition: Agnosticism is not recognized as a distinct religious group in Mexico, which can make it difficult for agnostics to assert their rights and freedoms under the law.
2. Limited protection against discrimination: While Mexico has laws that protect against discrimination based on religion, these laws do not explicitly cover agnosticism. As a result, agnostics may be at risk of discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and housing.
3. Difficulty accessing legal aid: Agnostics may face barriers when seeking legal aid, as many legal aid organizations focus on providing services to religious groups. This can make it difficult for agnostics to access the legal support they need.
