The impact of marital status on the lives of late pregnancy (third trimester) native Spanish speaker individuals can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional Support: Being in a supportive relationship during pregnancy can provide emotional comfort and security, which is crucial during this critical period. Married women may feel more secure and less anxious about the forthcoming birth and parenthood, as they have a partner to share the responsibilities and joys of pregnancy.
2. Financial Stability: Pregnancy can be costly, especially in the third trimester when medical expenses are higher. Married women may have more financial stability and support during this time, as their partners contribute to the household income or provide financial assistance.
3. Social Support Network: Marriage often provides a built-in social support network, which can be beneficial during pregnancy. Spouses can offer emotional support, help with errands and chores, and provide a listening ear when needed. This network can also extend to other family members and friends, creating a broader support system.
4. Decision-Making: Pregnancy requires numerous decisions, such as choosing prenatal care providers, preparing the home for the baby, and selecting parenting styles. Married women may have more decision-making power and support in these areas, as they work together with their partners to make important choices.
5. Identity Shift: Pregnancy can lead to an identity shift, particularly for women, as they adapt to their new role as a mother. Married women may experience this shift more gradually, as they navigate the changes in their relationship and identity alongside their partner.
6. Health Concerns: Pregnant women may experience different health concerns during the third trimester, such as gestational diabetes or preeclampsia. Married women may be more likely to receive better prenatal care and have access to medical resources due to their partners' influence and support.
7. Role Expectations: Pregnancy can bring new roles and expectations for both partners, such as anticipating the arrival of a new baby or navigating changes in household responsibilities. Married women may experience these changes more collaboratively with their partners, as they work together to adjust to their new roles.
