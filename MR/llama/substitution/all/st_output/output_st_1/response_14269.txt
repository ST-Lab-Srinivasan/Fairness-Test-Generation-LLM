Promoting the artistic expression of very old (90s+) individuals with no known genetic conditions can be a challenging but rewarding endeavor. Here are some strategies that could be effective:

1. Create intergenerational art programs: Pair older adults with younger artists or students to create joint art projects. This not only provides an opportunity for intergenerational exchange but also helps to combat age-related cognitive decline and social isolation.
2. Provide access to art supplies and resources: Ensure that older adults have access to art supplies, such as paints, brushes, canvases, and other materials. Many organizations offer free or low-cost art supplies for seniors, so look for local resources in your area.
3. Host art exhibitions and events: Organize art exhibitions that showcase the work of older adults, either in a gallery setting or online. This can help to promote their art and provide an opportunity for them to connect with a wider audience.
4. Offer art classes or workshops: Provide opportunities for older adults to learn new art techniques and mediums through classes or workshops. This can help to keep their minds active and engaged, as well as provide social interaction with peers.
5. Encourage self-expression through art: Encourage older adults to express themselves through art, without worrying about creating "perfect" pieces. This can help to boost self-esteem and confidence, while also promoting creativity and self-expression.
6. Collaborate with caregivers and healthcare providers: Work with caregivers and healthcare providers to promote the importance of artistic expression for older adults. They can provide valuable support and help to encourage older adults to engage in art-making activities.
7. Provide emotional support: Art-making can be a therapeutic outlet for older adults, helping them to process emotions and cope with challenges such as grief, loss, or cognitive decline. Offer emotional support and encouragement to help them navigate these challenges through art.
8. Create opportunities for intergenerational collaboration: Pair older adults with younger artists or students to create joint art projects. This can help to promote cross-generational understanding and respect
