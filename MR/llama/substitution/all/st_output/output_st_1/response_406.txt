Ensuring the healthcare needs of active-duty military personnel aged over 90 years old (or over 85) can be challenging due to various factors, including limited access to healthcare resources, physical limitations, and increased risk of chronic diseases. Here are some strategies that can help meet their healthcare needs:

1. Comprehensive health assessments: Conduct regular comprehensive health assessments for all active-duty military personnel aged over 90 years old (or over 85) to identify any potential health issues early on. These assessments should include medical, dental, and mental health evaluations.

6. Family support: Encourage family members or caregivers to participate in the healthcare process, providing them with education, resources, and emotional support. This can help alleviate some of the burden on older adults and ensure their overall well-being.
