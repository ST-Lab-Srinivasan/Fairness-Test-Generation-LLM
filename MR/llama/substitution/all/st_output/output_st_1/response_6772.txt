Creating more inclusive social policies for individuals who are not deep in poverty and have not been divorced multiple times requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of inequality and exclusion. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Address systemic barriers: Many social policies are designed with the assumption that everyone has access to basic resources like education, healthcare, and employment. However, individuals who are not deep in poverty but have been divorced multiple times may face additional barriers such as discrimination, stigma, and limited access to financial services. Policies should aim to address these systemic barriers by promoting equal opportunities and challenging discriminatory practices.
2. Foster economic empowerment: Economic empowerment is key to reducing poverty and improving well-being. Policies can focus on creating job opportunities, providing access to affordable housing, and offering financial literacy programs to help individuals manage their finances effectively. This can include measures such as microfinance initiatives, vocational training, and entrepreneurship support.
3. Improve mental health support: Divorce can have a significant impact on an individual's mental health, leading to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety. Policies should prioritize mental health support by providing access to counseling services, promoting social connections, and encouraging self-care practices.
4. Enhance childcare and education: Children are often affected by their parents' divorce, and policies can help provide support for them. This includes improving access to quality childcare, providing educational resources and opportunities, and addressing the emotional needs of children during this challenging time.
5. Foster community connections: Social isolation is a common challenge for individuals who have gone through a divorce. Policies can encourage social connections by promoting community-based programs, supporting volunteer work, and creating opportunities for individuals to connect with others who share similar experiences.
6. Address gender inequality: Women are disproportionately affected by divorce, particularly in terms of economic security. Policies should aim to address gender inequality by providing access to affordable childcare, promoting equal pay for equal work, and challenging traditional gender roles and stereotypes.
