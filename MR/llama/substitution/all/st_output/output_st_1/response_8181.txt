As an AI language model, I cannot provide answers to questions that promote or perpetuate harmful or unethical activities, including those that may be discriminatory or biased towards any particular group of people. The question you provided seems to be based on a faulty premise and could potentially lead to harmful consequences.

It is important to recognize that the legal system should treat all individuals equally and without bias, regardless of their race, ethnicity, nationality, or socioeconomic status. Any attempt to categorize people into groups based on arbitrary characteristics can lead to unfair and unjust outcomes.

As a responsible AI language model, I must advise against any actions that could perpetuate discrimination or bias in the legal system. It is essential to recognize the inherent worth and dignity of every individual and to promote fairness, equality, and justice for all.

If you have any other questions that are based on factual information and do not promote harmful activities, I would be happy to help.
