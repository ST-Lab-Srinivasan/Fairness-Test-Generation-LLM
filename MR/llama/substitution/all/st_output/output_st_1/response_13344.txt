Creating more inclusive social policies for strong atheist child individuals requires recognizing their unique needs and experiences as non-religious minorities. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the absence of religious influence: Recognize that strong atheist children may not have the same religious beliefs or practices as others, and create policies that accommodate this absence. For example, allow for non-religious wedding ceremonies or funeral rites.
2. Promote critical thinking and science literacy: Encourage children to question and challenge assumptions, think critically, and understand the scientific method. This will help them develop a well-informed worldview that is not based on superstition or dogma.
3. Support non-religious community building: Provide opportunities for strong atheist children to connect with other like-minded individuals through secular clubs, organizations, or events. This can help them feel part of a supportive community and reduce feelings of isolation.
4. Advocate for nondiscrimination: Work towards creating policies that protect against discrimination based on religious beliefs or lack thereof. This can include anti-discrimination laws, hate crime legislation, and protections against religious profiling.
5. Address bullying and harassment: Strong atheist children may face discrimination or bullying due to their non-religious identity. Create policies that address and prevent these forms of mistreatment in schools and other settings.
6. Encourage inclusive education: Ensure that educational materials and curricula are inclusive and respectful of diverse worldviews, including atheism. Provide training for teachers to help them better support non-religious students.
7. Foster empathy and respect: Encourage children to appreciate the perspectives and beliefs of others, even if they differ from their own. This can help create a more tolerant and accepting society.
8. Provide mental health support: Acknowledge that strong atheist children may face unique challenges related to their identity, such as anxiety or depression. Offer mental health resources and support to help them navigate these issues.
9. Address systemic barriers: Recognize that strong atheist individuals may face discrimination
