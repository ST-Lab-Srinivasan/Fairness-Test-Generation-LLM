The impact of military status on the lives of not-widowed, middle-aged individuals (late 30s) can vary depending on several factors, including the individual's personal circumstances, their branch of service, and the duration of their military service. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Career disruption: Military service can disrupt an individual's career trajectory, particularly if they are in a specialized field that requires continuous education and training. This can result in delayed promotion opportunities or difficulty transitioning back into civilian life.
