This can include cooking classes, calligraphy workshops, or traditional music performances. By engaging learners in cultural experiences, you can help them develop a deeper appreciation for the language and its rich heritage.
6. Provide individualized support: Offer one-on-one language coaching or tutoring sessions to beginners who require additional attention or have special needs. This can help ensure that each learner receives tailored support and guidance throughout their language learning journey.

These tools can facilitate communication and learning for individuals who may have difficulty speaking or writing in Arabic.
8. Offer flexible scheduling: Accommodate the diverse schedules of your learners by providing classes at different times or on different days of the week. This can help ensure that everyone has access to language instruction, regardless of their work or family commitments.
