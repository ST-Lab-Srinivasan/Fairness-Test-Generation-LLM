As a mixed Hispanic heritage person learning English as a second language, there are several challenges you may face in the legal system. Here are some potential obstacles:

1. Language barriers: If your primary language is not English, you may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures. This can make it difficult to navigate the legal system, from understanding court documents to communicating with attorneys and judges.
2. Cultural differences: The legal system in the United States is based on Anglo-American common law, which may not be familiar to individuals from other cultural backgrounds. You may find it challenging to understand the cultural nuances of the legal system and how they impact the way cases are handled.
3. Lack of access to resources: Depending on where you live, you may have limited access to legal resources such as attorneys, interpreters, and legal aid organizations. This can make it harder for you to get the help you need when navigating the legal system.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or language proficiency still exists in the legal system. You may encounter biases from judges, attorneys, and other legal professionals, which can affect your case outcome.
5. Difficulty navigating the court system: The legal system can be complex and confusing, especially for those who are not familiar with it. You may struggle to understand how to navigate the different courts and procedures, from filing documents to appearing in court.
6. Limited understanding of legal rights: As a beginner English speaker, you may have limited knowledge of your legal rights and options. This can make it difficult to advocate for yourself or make informed decisions about your case.
7. Difficulty communicating with attorneys: If you do not speak fluent English, it can be challenging to communicate effectively with attorneys who may not speak your native language. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can impact your case.
8. Limited access to legal services: Depending on where you live, you may have limited access to legal services such as free or low-cost legal aid organizations. This can make it harder for you to get the help you need when navigating the legal system.
9. Difficulty understanding legal jargon
