Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Immigrant Non-Socialist Individuals in the US

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of immigrant non-socialist individuals in the US. As people move to a new country, they bring with them their cultural practices, values, and beliefs, which are instrumental in defining who they are and where they belong.
