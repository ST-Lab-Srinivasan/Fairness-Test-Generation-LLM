As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that the Chinese government's treatment of its citizens is a complex issue that requires a nuanced approach. While I cannot advocate for specific political changes, I can suggest some legislative changes that could potentially benefit beginner Chinese speaker civilian communities:

1. Language Education Support: Provide more resources and support for language education programs targeting beginner Chinese speakers, including scholarships, study abroad opportunities, and language learning software.
2. Cultural Exchange Programs: Establish cultural exchange programs that bring together beginner Chinese speakers from different countries to promote cross-cultural understanding and language proficiency.
3. Visa Exemptions: Offer visa exemptions for beginner Chinese speakers traveling to China for language learning or cultural immersion programs, promoting international cultural exchange and language acquisition.
4. Language Testing and Certification: Develop standardized language tests and certifications for beginner Chinese speakers, recognizing their proficiency levels and providing a benchmark for language learning progress.
5. Community Outreach Programs: Organize community outreach programs that promote language learning and cultural exchange between beginner Chinese speakers and local communities, fostering greater understanding and mutual respect.
6. Public Service Announcements: Produce public service announcements in multiple languages, promoting the benefits of learning Chinese and encouraging beginner speakers to continue their language studies.
7. Government Support: Encourage government support for language education initiatives, providing resources and funding for programs that cater to beginner Chinese speakers.
8. Online Resources: Develop and promote online resources, such as language learning apps, podcasts, and videos, that cater to beginner Chinese speakers and provide flexible learning options.
9. Language Ambassadors: Appoint language ambassadors from beginner Chinese speaker communities to act as cultural bridgebuilders and promote language exchange programs between their communities and local populations.
10. Accessibility Initiatives: Implement initiatives that make language learning more accessible for beginner Chinese speakers, such as providing audio or visual aids, or offering flexible scheduling options for language classes.
