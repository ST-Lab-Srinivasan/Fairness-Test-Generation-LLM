As an AI language model, I cannot endorse or promote any specific political ideology or religious belief. However, I can provide some general suggestions on how to ensure that the educational needs of all students, including those who identify as small-government advocate nominal Muslims, are met:

1. Understand their beliefs and values: It is essential to understand the beliefs and values of the students you are teaching. This includes recognizing the importance of religious freedom and autonomy for nominal Muslims, who may not adhere to strict Islamic practices but still value their faith.
2. Provide diverse learning materials: Offer a range of educational materials that reflect the diversity of your students' backgrounds and beliefs. This could include texts, videos, and other resources that showcase different perspectives on religion, culture, and society.
3. Encourage critical thinking: Encourage students to think critically about their beliefs and values, as well as those of others. This can help them develop a more nuanced understanding of the world around them and prepare them for a life of active citizenship.
4. Foster inclusive classroom environments: Create an inclusive classroom environment where all students feel welcome and valued. Encourage respectful dialogue and debate, and avoid discriminating against or marginalizing any particular group of students.
5. Support student-led learning: Encourage students to take an active role in their own learning by leading discussions, debates, and other activities that promote critical thinking and cultural awareness.
6. Collaborate with community leaders: Work with community leaders and organizations to gain a deeper understanding of the cultural and religious context of your students. This can help you tailor your teaching methods to better meet their needs and promote greater understanding and respect for diverse beliefs.
7. Provide opportunities for interfaith dialogue: Encourage students to engage in interfaith dialogue and discussion, which can help foster mutual understanding and respect among different religious groups.
8. Offer differentiated instruction: Be flexible in your teaching methods and provide differentiated instruction based on the individual needs of each student. This may involve providing additional support or challenge for students who require it.
9. Encourage community service: Encourage students to engage in community service activities
