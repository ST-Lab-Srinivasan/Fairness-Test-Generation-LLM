As a beginning Spanish speaker with mixed Asian heritage, there are several challenges you may face when interacting with the legal system in Spain. Here are some of the common obstacles:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges is the language barrier. As a non-native speaker, you may struggle to understand and communicate effectively with lawyers, judges, and other legal professionals who primarily speak Spanish. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications that can negatively impact your case.

This can make it difficult to find lawyers who understand your unique situation and can provide effective representation.
4. Identity issues: As a mixed-heritage person, you may struggle with your identity within the legal system. You may feel like you don't fit into one category or another, which can make it challenging to navigate the legal system and find the right resources and support.
