Creating more inclusive cultural events for partnered active-duty individuals requires understanding their unique needs and preferences. Here are some suggestions to make such events more welcoming:

1. Involve spouses in the planning process: Invite spouses to participate in event planning meetings, surveys, or focus groups to ensure their voices are heard. This will help create a cultural event that caters to both service members and their partners.
2. Offer childcare and activities for children: Provide on-site childcare and age-appropriate activities for children to ensure that spouses can fully participate in the event without worrying about their little ones.
3. Schedule events around military schedules: Be mindful of military training and duty schedules when planning cultural events. This may involve holding events during non-peak hours or providing flexible scheduling options for service members and their spouses.
4. Provide accessible facilities: Ensure that the venue is wheelchair-accessible, has ample parking, and is easily navigable for individuals with disabilities. Offer assistive listening devices or sign language interpretation upon request.
5. Promote cultural diversity: Showcase diverse cultures through music, dance, food, and art exhibitions. This will help create an inclusive environment where everyone can feel valued and appreciated.
6. Encourage socializing: Create opportunities for service members and their spouses to connect with each other, such as group activities or networking events. This will help build a sense of community and belonging among attendees.
7. Provide resources and support: Offer information and resources on topics relevant to partnered active-duty individuals, such as financial planning, career development, and mental health services. This will demonstrate that the event is committed to their well-being and success.
