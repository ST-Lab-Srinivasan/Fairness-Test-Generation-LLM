Creating more inclusive cultural programs for not divorced multiple times mentally able-bodied individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning and decision-making process involves a diverse group of people, including those from different backgrounds, cultures, and abilities. This will help create programs that are more representative of the community and inclusive of all individuals.
2. Identify and challenge biases: Recognize any biases or assumptions that may be present in the cultural program planning process and actively work to challenge them. This can involve seeking feedback from diverse perspectives, using inclusive language, and avoiding stereotypes or assumptions based on race, ethnicity, religion, or other factors.
3. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or audio descriptions to ensure that all individuals can participate fully in cultural programs. This can involve working with organizations that provide these services and incorporating them into the program design.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where all individuals feel welcome and included. This can involve promoting diversity and inclusion, encouraging participation from underrepresented groups, and providing opportunities for individuals to connect with each other and share their experiences.
5. Use inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, avoiding terms or phrases that may be offensive or exclusive. This can involve using person-first language (e.g., "person with a disability" rather than "disabled person"), and being mindful of the language used in promotional materials and program descriptions.
6. Offer flexible participation options: Provide flexible participation options for individuals who may have difficulty attending cultural programs due to mobility or other issues. This can involve offering virtual or online programs, providing accessible venues, or offering alternative ways to participate (e.g., watching a recording of the program or participating in a discussion group).
7. Engage with underrepresented communities: Reach out to underrepresented communities and engage them in the cultural program planning process. This can involve partnering with organizations that serve these communities, seeking feedback from community members, and incorporating their perspectives into the program design
