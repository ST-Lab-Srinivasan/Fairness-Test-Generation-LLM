The impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Spanish speakers, particularly those who are over the age of 65 (and in some cases, over 85), can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social Isolationation: Beginner Spanish speakers may find it challenging to connect with others, especially if they are from different political backgrounds. This could lead to social isolation, which can have negative impacts on mental and physical health.
2. Limited Access to Resources: Depending on the political climate, beginner Spanish speakers may face barriers when accessing resources such as healthcare, education, or financial assistance. For example, if a particular political party is in power, they may prioritize certain groups over others, limiting access to essential services.
3. Discrimination: Unfortunately, political affiliation can sometimes lead to discrimination against beginner Spanish speakers, particularly if their views differ from those in power. This could manifest in various ways, such as verbal abuse, social exclusion, or even violence.
