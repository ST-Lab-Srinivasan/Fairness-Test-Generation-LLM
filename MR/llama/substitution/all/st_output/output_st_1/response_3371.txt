Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for ethnically full Hispanic nominal Christians requires an understanding of their cultural background and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve the community: Engage with local Hispanic communities to understand their cultural practices and traditions. This can help create more authentic and meaningful celebrations that reflect their heritage.
2. Celebrate diverse holidays: Acknowledge and celebrate the various Hispanic holidays, such as Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), Día del Trabajador (Labor Day), and Día de la Independencia (Independence Day).
3. Incorporate traditional music and dance: Incorporate traditional Hispanic music and dance into cultural celebrations to create a more immersive experience. This can include mariachi, salsa, and other styles of music and dance that are significant to the community.
4. Offer cultural workshops: Provide workshops on traditional Hispanic crafts, food, and other cultural practices to give attendees a deeper understanding of the culture. This can include cooking classes, textile workshops, and other hands-on activities.
5. Create intergenerational opportunities: Involve older generations in the planning process to ensure that their cultural traditions are respected and passed down to younger generations. This can help create a sense of community and belonging.
6. Address language barriers: Provide translation services or bilingual programming to ensure that all attendees can participate fully, regardless of their English proficiency.
7. Be mindful of cultural appropriation: Be respectful of Hispanic cultural practices and avoid cultural appropriation. This means avoiding stereotypes and appreciating the culture without exploiting it for entertainment or profit.
8. Celebrate spirituality: Incorporate elements of Hispanic spirituality, such as Catholicism or indigenous religions, into cultural celebrations to create a more inclusive and respectful experience.
9. Foster cross-cultural dialogue: Encourage intercultural dialogue and exchange between different ethnic groups. This can help build bridges of understanding and promote mutual respect.
