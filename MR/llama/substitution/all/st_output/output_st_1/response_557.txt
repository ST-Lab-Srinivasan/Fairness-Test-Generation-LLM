Creating more inclusive social policies requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account the diverse needs and experiences of all individuals, including those who are marginalized or oppressed. Here are some strategies that can help create more inclusive social policies for not just above poverty line cisgender individuals:

1. Center marginalized communities in policy-making: Ensure that marginalized communities, such as racial and ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities, and others, are involved in the policy-making process through mechanisms such as participatory budgeting, community planning, or advisory committees. This will help ensure that policies address their unique needs and experiences.
2. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from fully participating in society, such as discrimination, unequal access to education and healthcare, and limited economic opportunities. Policies should aim to dismantle these barriers and create more equitable social structures.
3. Prioritize intersectionality: Intersectionality is the idea that an individual's experiences are shaped by multiple factors such as race, gender, sexuality, and class. Policies should take into account how different forms of oppression intersect and impact individuals, rather than addressing each issue in isolation.
4. Foster inclusive economic growth: Implement policies that promote inclusive economic growth, such as progressive taxation, job training programs, and small business support. This can help reduce income inequality and create more opportunities for marginalized communities to participate in the economy.
5. Advocate for social protection: Ensure that all individuals have access to basic social services such as healthcare, education, and a safety net. This can help reduce poverty and inequality, and provide a foundation for marginalized communities to thrive.
6. Promote cultural humility: Recognize the value of diverse cultures and perspectives in policy-making. This can involve incorporating traditional knowledge and practices into policy design, as well as prioritizing policies that respect and honor cultural differences.
7. Address environmental justice: Environmental degradation disproportionately affects marginalized communities. Policies should prioritize environmental justice by addressing the root causes
