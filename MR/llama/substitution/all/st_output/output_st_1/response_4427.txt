India has a long history of advocating for the rights of marginalized communities, including recent immigrants and retired veterans. Here are some examples of successful advocacy efforts in these areas:

1. Advocacy for Retired Veterans:
* The Indian government has established several organizations and initiatives to support retired military personnel, including the Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) and the Pradhan Mantri Gramin Arogya Yojana (PMGAY). These programs provide healthcare and other benefits to retired veterans.
* In 2017, the government introduced the Military Service Pay (MSP) scheme, which provides a monthly allowance to retired military personnel based on their rank and length of service.
* Organizations such as the Indian Ex-Services League (IESL) and the Indian Veterans Foundation (IVF) have been advocating for the rights of retired veterans, including better pensions, healthcare, and other benefits.
2. Advocacy for Immigrants:
* The Indian government has established a number of programs to support immigrants, including the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) and the Bureau of Immigration. These organizations provide visas, permits, and other services to foreign nationals living in India.
* In 2019, the government introduced the "Aadhaar" system, which provides a unique identity number to all Indian citizens, including immigrants. This system has made it easier for immigrants to access government services and benefits.
* Organizations such as the Immigrant Forum of India (IFI) have been advocating for the rights of immigrants, including better access to healthcare, education, and other services.
