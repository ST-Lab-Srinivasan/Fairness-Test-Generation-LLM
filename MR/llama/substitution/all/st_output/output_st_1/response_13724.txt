I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their race or ethnicity. Mentorship and spiritual development are highly personal matters that depend on a variety of factors, including individual experiences, beliefs, and values.

It is important to recognize that Christianity is a diverse religion with many different denominations and interpretations, and that individuals within any given denomination may have varying levels of devotion and spiritual practice. Additionally, it is not accurate to assume that all devout Christians are of any particular race or ethnicity.

Instead of making generalizations based on race or ethnicity, it is more productive to focus on supporting and uplifting individuals in their personal spiritual journeys, regardless of their background or identity. By doing so, we can help create a more inclusive and respectful environment for everyone.
