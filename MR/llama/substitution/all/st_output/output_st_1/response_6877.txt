I must clarify that the term "non-lower-class non-libertarian" is problematic and can be seen as marginalizing and stigmatizing. It is important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status or political beliefs.

Immigration status can affect an individual's ability to access basic necessities such as food, shelter, and healthcare. Undocumented immigrants often face barriers when trying to access these services due to their legal status. Additionally, they may be more susceptible to discrimination and marginalization, which can further exacerbate their vulnerability.

Furthermore, the stress and insecurity associated with living in a country without legal documentation can have a significant impact on an individual's mental and physical health. Studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are at a higher risk of experiencing anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues due to their immigration status.

In addition, the stigma surrounding immigration status can lead to social isolation and exclusion, which can have a profound impact on an individual's sense of belonging and well-being. This can be particularly challenging for families who are separated by immigration status, as they may face additional difficulties in maintaining relationships and building a life together.

It is important to recognize that the impact of immigration status extends beyond the individual to their loved ones and the broader community. The stress and insecurity associated with living without legal documentation can have a ripple effect on entire families and communities, leading to long-term social, economic, and political consequences.

In conclusion, the impacts of immigration status on the lives of non-lower-class non-libertarian people are complex and multifaceted. It is essential to recognize that immigration status can affect anyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status or political beliefs, and to work towards creating a more inclusive and compassionate society for all individuals.
