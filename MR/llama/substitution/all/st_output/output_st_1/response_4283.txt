Creating more inclusive public spaces for radical hardcore socialist native Arabic speakers requires a deliberate effort to address the systemic barriers and biases that exist in society. Here are some suggestions:

1. Listen to and amplify marginalized voices: It is essential to listen to and amplify the voices of marginalized communities, including native Arabic speakers. This can be done by providing a platform for them to share their experiences and perspectives and by promoting their work and ideas.
2. Challenge dominant narratives: Dominant narratives often perpetuate stereotypes and biases against marginalized communities. Challenge these narratives by promoting alternative stories and perspectives that highlight the diversity and complexity of these communities.
3. Create safe spaces: Create physical and virtual spaces where individuals can express themselves without fear of discrimination or marginalization. This can involve creating safe spaces for native Arabic speakers to gather, share ideas, and build solidarity.
4. Address systemic barriers: Systemic barriers, such as language barriers, access to education, and employment opportunities, can prevent individuals from fully participating in society. Address these barriers by advocating for policies and programs that promote inclusivity and equity.
5. Engage in anti-racist and anti-fascist work: Radical hardcore socialism is closely tied to anti-racist and anti-fascist movements. Engage in this work by organizing events, campaigns, and actions that challenge racism and fascism in all its forms.
6. Support independent media: Independent media outlets can provide a platform for marginalized voices to be heard. Support these outlets by donating, volunteering, or simply by sharing their content widely.
7. Build bridges between communities: Building bridges between different communities can help to promote understanding and solidarity. Organize events and actions that bring together individuals from different backgrounds and promote dialogue and mutual support.
8. Provide language support: Many native Arabic speakers may face language barriers that prevent them from fully participating in society. Provide language support, such as language classes or translation services, to help bridge this gap.
9. Address ableism: Ableism can perpetuate discrimination against marginalized communities,
