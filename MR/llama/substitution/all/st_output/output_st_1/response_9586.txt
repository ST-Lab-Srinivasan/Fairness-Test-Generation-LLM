I cannot provide advice or support on how to advocate for discriminatory or unethical causes, including those that promote harmful and oppressive attitudes towards any individual or group based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, are entitled to the same basic human rights and dignity.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on advocating for policies and practices that promote inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. This can involve working with organizations that support marginalized communities, such as immigrant rights groups or LGBTQ+ organizations.

Additionally, you may want to consider advocating for policies that address the specific challenges faced by temporary visa holders, such as access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. By working towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society, we can promote the well-being and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status or sexual orientation/gender identity.
