Title: Examining the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Mixed Hispanic Heritage Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those with mixed or complex identities. Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals, who identify as both Hispanic and another ethnicity, face unique challenges in navigating their cultural identities. This paper will explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of mixed Hispanic heritage extreme moderate liberal individuals, examining how they reconcile their multiple identities and express themselves through cultural practices.

Theory:
According to identity theory, an individual's identity is composed of various components, including cultural, social, and personal factors (Hall, 1980). Mixed Hispanic heritage individuals must navigate these different components to create a cohesive sense of self. Cultural heritage plays a crucial role in this process, as it provides a foundation for understanding one's identity and how it is expressed through cultural practices.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with mixed Hispanic heritage individuals who identify as extreme moderate liberal. Participants will be recruited through snowball sampling and purposive sampling techniques, ensuring a diverse range of participants. Data will be analyzed using thematic analysis to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Expected Results:
The findings of this study are expected to reveal the complex ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities of mixed Hispanic heritage individuals. Specifically, it is anticipated that participants will discuss how their cultural heritage influences their sense of self, their relationships with others, and their political beliefs. The study will also explore how participants navigate and reconcile their multiple identities, including their Hispanic identity, to create a cohesive sense of self.

Conclusion:
This study will contribute to our understanding of the complex ways in which cultural heritage shapes the identities of mixed Hispanic heritage individuals. By examining how participants navigate and reconcile their multiple identities, this research will provide valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by this group. The findings of this study have
