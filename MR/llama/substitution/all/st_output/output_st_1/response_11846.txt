As a native English speaker and a natural-born Indian citizen, I have experienced some challenges in the Indian healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges faced by native English speakers in India:

4. Cost: Healthcare in India can be expensive, especially for foreign nationals who may not have adequate health insurance coverage. This can be a significant challenge for native English speakers who may not be prepared for the costs associated with medical treatment in India.
5. Quality of care: While India has made significant strides in improving its healthcare infrastructure, there may still be variations in the quality of care provided across different regions and hospitals.

6. Lack of familiarity with medical facilities: As a foreign national, native English speakers may be unfamiliar with the layout and operations of Indian hospitals, which can make it difficult to navigate the healthcare system.

Native English speakers may find it challenging to understand their treatment options and make informed decisions about their care.
9. Limited access to emergency services: In some areas of India, particularly rural ones, there may be limited access to emergency medical
