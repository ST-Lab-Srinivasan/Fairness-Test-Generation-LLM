Non-citizens, including undocumented immigrants, face significant challenges when accessing healthcare in the United States. Here are some of the main challenges faced by non-citizen individuals who are not recently widowed:

1. Lack of access to health insurance: Many non-citizens, including those without legal status, are unable to purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces or Medicaid due to their immigration status.
2. Limited eligibility for public programs: Non-citizens may be ineligible for certain publicly funded healthcare programs, such as Medicaid, if they do not meet the program's eligibility requirements.
3. Language barriers: Non-citizens may face language barriers when trying to navigate the healthcare system, which can make it difficult to access care or understand their options.
4. Fear of discrimination: Non-citizens may be hesitant to seek medical care due to fear of discrimination or deportation.
5. Limited cultural competency: The healthcare system may not be culturally competent in addressing the unique needs of non-citizen patients, leading to a lack of understanding and poor care.
6. Difficulty finding providers who speak their language: Non-citizens may have difficulty finding healthcare providers who speak their native language, which can create barriers to accessing care.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Non-citens may have limited access to specialized care, such as mental health services or cancer treatment, due to their immigration status.
8. Inability to file complaints or seek legal action: Non-citizens may be unable to file complaints or seek legal action if they experience poor care or mistreatment due to their immigration status.
9. Limited access to preventive care: Non-citens may have limited access to preventive care, such as routine check-ups and screenings, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment of health problems.
10. Stigma and discrimination: Non-citens may face stigma and discrimination within the healthcare system, which can affect their ability to access care and receive appropriate treatment.
