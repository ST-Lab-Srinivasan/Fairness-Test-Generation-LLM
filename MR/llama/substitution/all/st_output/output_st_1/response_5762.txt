Addressing the needs of temporary visa holders during disaster responses can be challenging, especially when it comes to individuals without children. Here are some potential strategies that can help:

1. Engage local organizations: Work with local organizations that are familiar with the community and have existing networks. They can provide valuable insights into the needs of temporary visa holders and help reach out to them during a disaster response.
2. Provide culturally appropriate communication: Ensure that communication materials are translated into the languages spoken by the affected communities, and that they are culturally appropriate. This can help build trust and increase the likelihood that individuals will seek assistance.
3. Create safe spaces: Establish safe spaces where temporary visa holders can access basic necessities like food, water, shelter, and medical care without fear of discrimination or deportation.
4. Offer tailored support: Provide targeted support to meet the unique needs of temporary visa holders, such as language classes, job training, and legal assistance. This can help them become more self-sufficient and better equipped to handle emergencies.
5. Build partnerships with advocacy groups: Collaborate with organizations that advocate for the rights of immigrants and refugees. They can provide valuable insights into the needs of these communities and help amplify your disaster response efforts.
6. Leverage technology: Utilize technology to reach out to temporary visa holders, such as text messaging, social media, and online platforms. This can help ensure that they receive critical information and support during a disaster response.
7. Develop inclusive policies: Create policies that are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. This can help build trust and ensure that everyone has access to the resources they need during a disaster response.
8. Provide training for responders: Offer training for responders on how to work with temporary visa holders, including cultural competency training and language training. This can help ensure that responders are better equipped to address the needs of these individuals during a disaster response.
9. Develop community-based responses: Work with local communities to develop community-based responses that take into account the unique needs of temporary visa holders. This can help build trust and ensure that these individuals receive the support they need
