The impact of military status on the lives of moderate to deep poverty individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to basic needs: Military personnel, especially those stationed in remote or combat areas, may face challenges accessing basic necessities like food, water, shelter, and healthcare. This can exacerbate poverty and make it difficult for individuals to escape the cycle of poverty.
2. Unstable income: Military pay is often lower than civilian pay scales, and the unpredictability of military deployment can result in irregular or reduced income. This can further impede poverty reduction efforts.
