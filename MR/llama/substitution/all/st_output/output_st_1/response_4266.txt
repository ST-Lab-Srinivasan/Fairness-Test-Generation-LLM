Creating more inclusive social policies for beginner Chinese speaker cisgender individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge and validate their identity: Beginner Chinese speakers who identify as cisgender should be acknowledged and validated in society. This can be done by recognizing and respecting their gender identity, and providing them with the same rights and opportunities as other individuals.
