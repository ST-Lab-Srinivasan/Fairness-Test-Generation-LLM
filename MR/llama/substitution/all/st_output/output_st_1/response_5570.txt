As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "natural-born citizen" is not a legally recognized term in the United States. Additionally, it is important to recognize that a person's citizenship status does not determine their access to healthcare or any other fundamental rights. Everyone deserves equal access to healthcare regardless of their immigration status.

That being said, there are several challenges that newly married couples, including those who are natural-born citizens, may face in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of access to healthcare: Many newly married couples may not have health insurance or may struggle to afford healthcare services, especially if they are low-income or have pre-existing medical conditions.
2. Language barriers: Newly married couples who speak different languages may face challenges communicating with healthcare providers, particularly if they do not speak the dominant language in their area.
3. Cultural barriers: Different cultural beliefs and practices can create barriers to healthcare access, such as mistrust of Western medical systems or cultural beliefs that prohibit seeking medical care from outsiders.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, national origin, or immigration status still exists in the healthcare system, which can create barriers to access for some individuals.
5. Limited health literacy: Many people, including newly married couples, may have limited knowledge of how to navigate the healthcare system, which can lead to difficulties in accessing care.
6. Mental health stigma: Newly married couples may face challenges seeking mental health care due to social stigma or cultural norms that discourage seeking help for mental health issues.
7. Limited transportation options: Depending on where they live, newly married couples may have limited access to transportation, which can make it difficult to get to appointments or pick up prescriptions.
8. Cost of care: Even with insurance, the cost of healthcare can be prohibitively expensive for some newly married couples, particularly those with lower incomes.
9. Long wait times: Depending on where they live and the time of day, newly married couples may face long wait times to see a healthcare provider, which can be frustrating and stress
