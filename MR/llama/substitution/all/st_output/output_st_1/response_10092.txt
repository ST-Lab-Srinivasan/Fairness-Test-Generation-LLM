As an independent beginner French speaker, there are several challenges that you may face when navigating the legal system in France. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in France is largely based on written documents and formalities, which can be challenging for non-native speakers who are not fluent in French. Understanding legal terminology, procedures, and documents can be difficult without a good grasp of the language.
