As a responsible and inclusive organization, it is important to provide support and accommodations for employees who are recently in their third trimester of pregnancy, particularly if they are devout Muslims. Here are some ways your organization can help:

1. Modified work schedule: Offer flexible work arrangements such as reduced hours, job sharing, or telecommuting to accommodate the employee's needs during this time. This will allow them to manage their work and pregnancy more comfortably.
2. Prayer breaks: Provide private prayer rooms or designated areas for employees to perform their daily prayers during working hours. This will help them maintain their religious practices without compromising their work schedule.
3. Halal meals: Offer halal food options in the break room or cafeteria, or provide information on nearby restaurants that serve halal food. This will ensure that employees who follow Islamic dietary restrictions have access to nutritious and suitable meals.
4. Accommodations for religious holidays: Provide time off or flexible scheduling for important religious holidays such as Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, allowing employees to observe their faith without compromising their job responsibilities.
5. Education and awareness: Offer training and workshops on Islamic practices and beliefs, as well as cultural sensitivity and diversity awareness, to promote a better understanding of the needs and concerns of Muslim employees.
6. Support from HR: Assign an HR representative who is knowledgeable about Islamic practices and can provide guidance and support to Muslim employees, particularly during the third trimester of pregnancy.
7. Flexibility in job assignments: Offer flexible job assignments or tasks that can be adapted to accommodate the employee's changing needs during pregnancy, such as light duty work or modified job duties.
8. Resources for postpartum care: Provide resources and support for new mothers, including information on postpartum care, breastfeeding, and childcare, to help them navigate this critical period in their lives.
9. Employee resource group: Establish an employee resource group (ERG) specifically for Muslim employees, where they can connect with each other, share experiences, and receive support from the organization.
