The legal system can be complex and intimidating for anyone, regardless of their gender or identity. However, there are specific challenges that masculine civilian people may face within the legal system. Here are some potential challenges:

1. Stereotypes and biases: Men and masculinity are often associated with certain stereotypes and biases within the legal system.
