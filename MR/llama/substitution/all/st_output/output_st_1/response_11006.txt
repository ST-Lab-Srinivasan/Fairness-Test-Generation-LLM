Creating more inclusive social policies for upper upper middle-income lifelong singletons requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the unique challenges and needs of this demographic. Here are some suggestions:

1. Acknowledge the existence of lifelong singletons: Lifelong singletons often feel invisible in societal discourse, as they don't fit into traditional categories such as "young" or "old." By acknowledging their existence and experiences, we can start to create policies that are tailored to their needs.
2. Recognize the challenges of lifelong singletons: Lifelong singletons often face unique challenges, such as social isolation, limited access to healthcare and social services, and discrimination based on their age or marital status. Policies should aim to address these challenges directly.
3. Encourage intergenerational connections: Lifelong singletons are often isolated from younger and older generations. Policies could encourage intergenerational connections by promoting mentorship programs, community events, and cross-age friendships.
4. Foster age-friendly communities: Communities that are designed to be accessible and inclusive for people of all ages can help lifelong singletons feel more connected and supported. This could involve things like age-friendly housing, public transportation, and community spaces.
5. Support mental health and wellbeing: Lifelong singletons may face unique mental health challenges, such as anxiety or depression. Policies should prioritize mental health support and wellbeing, including access to counseling services and stress management techniques.
6. Provide financial support: Many lifelong singletons face financial insecurity, particularly if they have not saved enough for retirement. Policies could provide financial support through retirement savings plans or other forms of assistance.
7. Challenge ageist stereotypes and biases: Ageist attitudes and stereotypes can contribute to the marginalization of lifelong singletons. Policies should actively challenge these biases and promote age-inclusive attitudes and practices.
8. Promote flexible work arrangements: Lifelong singletons may face challenges in the workplace
