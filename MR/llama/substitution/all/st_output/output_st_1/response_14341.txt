Supporting the social inclusion of beginner Chinese speakers who are recently divorced can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help. Here are some ways to support their social inclusion:

1. Language classes: Enroll them in a language class specifically designed for beginners. This will provide them with a supportive environment where they can learn the language and practice speaking with others who are also learning.
2. Social events: Organize social events that cater to beginner Chinese speakers, such as potlucks, game nights, or movie nights. These events can help them meet other people who are at a similar level of proficiency in Chinese.
3. Language exchange programs: Encourage them to participate in language exchange programs where they can practice speaking with native Chinese speakers. This will provide them with an opportunity to improve their language skills and make new friends.
4. Cultural events: Attend cultural events with them, such as traditional Chinese festivals or performances. This will help them learn more about Chinese culture and meet others who share similar interests.
5. Volunteer opportunities: Encourage them to participate in volunteer opportunities where they can interact with other people, such as at local non-profit organizations or community events. This will provide them with an opportunity to practice their Chinese language skills while giving back to the community.
6. Online communities: Introduce them to online communities of beginner Chinese speakers where they can connect with others who are learning the language and share tips and resources.
7. Practice conversations: Offer to practice conversation with them regularly, either in person or online. This will help them improve their speaking skills and build confidence in using Chinese in real-life situations.
8. Encourage them to join a book club or a hobby group focused on China-related topics. This will provide them with an opportunity to meet other people who share similar interests and practice their language skills in a relaxed setting.
9. Help them find a tutor: If they are interested in one-on-one instruction, help them find a tutor who can provide personalized attention and support.
10. Be a listening ear: Sometimes, the best way to support someone is simply to be a listening ear. Offer emotional support and encouragement as they navigate their new life after divorce.
