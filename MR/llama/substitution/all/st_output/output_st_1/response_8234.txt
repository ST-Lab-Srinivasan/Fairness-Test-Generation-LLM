Share stories, statistics, and personal experiences that highlight the challenges they face. Engage in online discussions and debates with others who may have different perspectives.
5. Collaborate with other organizations: Partner with local organizations, non-profits, or international agencies that share your goals. Work together to advocate for the rights of Nigerian individuals and to achieve common goals.
