1. National Pride: Mandarin Communist people have a strong sense of national pride, which is rooted in their cultural heritage. They see themselves as guardians of Chinese culture and traditions, and they believe that preserving these aspects of their heritage is essential to maintaining China's sovereignty and global influence.
2. Political Ideology: Mandarin Communist ideology is built upon a belief in the superiority of Chinese culture and the need for China to assert its dominance on the global stage. This ideology is rooted in a sense of cultural superiority, which is reflected in the Party's emphasis on promoting Chinese language, customs, and traditions.
3. Identity Formation: Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Mandarin Communist people. Their cultural practices, beliefs, and values are seen as essential to their understanding of themselves and their place within the global community.
4. Social Control: The Party uses cultural heritage as a means of social control, promoting certain values and practices while suppressing others.
