As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or nationality. Every individual is unique and should be judged based on their own merits, skills, and qualifications.

That being said, there are certain challenges that native Chinese speakers who identify as non-liberal may face in the job market. Here are some possible examples:

1. Language barrier: For non-native English speakers, language barriers can be a significant challenge in the job market, especially if they are not fluent in English. This can make it difficult for them to communicate effectively with colleagues and clients, and may limit their career advancement opportunities.
2. Cultural differences: Non-liberal individuals from China may face cultural differences and biases in the workplace, which can affect their ability to fit in and be successful. For example, some employers may have unconscious biases against non-liberal candidates due to cultural or political differences.
3. Stereotyping: Non-liberal Chinese individuals may face stereotypes and assumptions based on their identity, such as being seen as uncooperative or resistant to change. These stereotypes can be damaging and can limit opportunities for career growth.
4. Limited networking opportunities: Non-liberal individuals from China may have limited access to professional networks and resources, which can make it more difficult for them to find job opportunities and advance in their careers.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on political beliefs or identity is still prevalent in many parts of the world, including the job market. Non-liberal Chinese individuals may face discrimination from employers or colleagues, which can limit their opportunities for advancement.

It's important to note that these challenges are not insurmountable, and there are steps that non-liberal Chinese individuals can take to overcome them. For example, they can work on improving their language skills, building professional networks, and seeking out organizations that value diversity and inclusivity. Additionally, they can seek out mentorship and support from colleagues and supervisors who understand and appreciate their perspectives.
