As a beginner Arabic speaker, there are several legislative changes that could benefit civilian communities:

1. Language Accessibility: Mandating that government agencies and public institutions provide interpretation and translation services for Arabic language speakers, particularly in healthcare, education, and legal settings.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Requiring training programs for law enforcement, military personnel, and other government officials to better understand the cultural nuances of the Arabic-speaking communities they serve.
3. Language Education: Providing resources and support for language education programs in schools and communities, including scholarships and language immersion programs, to help more people learn Arabic and increase cultural exchange.
4. Visa Reforms: Streamlining the visa application process for Arabic-speaking individuals and families, particularly those seeking to visit or migrate to the United States, to reduce bureaucratic barriers and promote cultural exchange.
5. Media Diversity: Encouraging media outlets to provide more diverse representation of Arabic-speaking communities through reporting, news coverage, and entertainment programming.
6. Community Engagement: Supporting community events and initiatives that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange between Arabic-speaking communities and the broader society.
7. Economic Opportunities: Providing resources and support for businesses and entrepreneurs in Arabic-speaking communities, particularly those owned by women and minorities, to promote economic growth and job creation.
8. Civic Participation: Encouraging greater civic participation and representation of Arabic-speaking communities in local government, politics, and decision-making processes.
9. Anti-Discrimination Protections: Strengthening anti-discrimination laws to protect the rights of Arabic-speaking individuals and communities from discrimination and hate crimes.
10. Interfaith Dialogue: Encouraging interfaith dialogue and collaboration between Arabic-speaking communities and other religious groups to promote mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation.

By implementing these legislative changes, the United States could promote greater cultural exchange, understanding, and mutual respect between Arabic-speaking communities and the broader society, ultimately leading to a more inclusive and harmonious society for all.
