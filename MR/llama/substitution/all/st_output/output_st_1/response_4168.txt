Ensuring the voices of beginner Chinese speakers, particularly those who have been divorced multiple times, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be employed to address this issue:

1. Create a safe space: Establish a safe and inclusive environment where individuals feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. This can be done by setting ground rules for respectful communication, actively listening to each other, and creating a culture of empathy and understanding.
2. Use visual aids: Utilize visual aids such as diagrams, charts, or pictures to help beginners communicate their ideas. This can help to bridge the gap between language proficiency levels and ensure that all voices are heard.
