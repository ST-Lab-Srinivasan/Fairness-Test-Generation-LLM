Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of non-disabled Nigerians, particularly in a country with a complex and often contentious political landscape. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to resources and opportunities: In Nigeria, political affiliation can influence access to resources such as education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. For example, individuals who belong to a particular political party may have better access to government jobs, scholarships, or other forms of financial assistance.
2. Social inclusion/exclusion: In Nigeria, political affiliation can also affect an individual's social status and level of inclusion in society. Members of certain political parties may be viewed as more prestigious or desirable than others, leading to increased social opportunities and networking possibilities. On the other hand, individuals who do not belong to a particular political party may face discrimination or exclusion from social events or opportunities.
3. Security and safety: In some cases, political affiliation can impact an individual's sense of security and safety. For example, members of certain political parties may be subject to harassment, intimidation, or violence based on their political beliefs or affiliations.
4. Freedom of expression: In Nigeria, individuals with different political affiliations may face restrictions on their freedom of expression, particularly if they belong to a minority group or hold unpopular views. This can limit their ability to express themselves freely and participate in political discourse.
5. Voting rights: In Nigeria, citizens have the right to vote for their preferred candidates in elections. However, individuals with different political affiliations may face barriers to exercising this right, such as restrictions on voting or intimidation at polling stations.
6. Representation and voice: Political affiliation can also impact an individual's ability to be represented and heard in the political sphere. For example, members of certain political parties may have more influence over policy decisions or be more likely to hold positions of power and authority.
7. Economic opportunities: In Nigeria, political affiliation can affect access to economic opportunities such as government contracts, business loans, or investment opportunities. For example, individuals who belong to a particular political party may have better access to these resources than those who do not.
8. Social mobility
