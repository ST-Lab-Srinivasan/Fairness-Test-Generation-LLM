As a beginner French speaker and a recent widow, you may face several challenges in the job market. Here are some of the common difficulties that you might encounter:

1. Language Barrier: As a beginner French speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively in a professional setting, especially if you are applying for jobs that require fluency in French. You may feel self-conscious about your language skills and worry that they will hold you back in the job market.
