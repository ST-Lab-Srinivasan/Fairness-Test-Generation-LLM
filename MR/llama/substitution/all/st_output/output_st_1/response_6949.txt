4. Adaptable Curriculum: Develop an adaptable curriculum that takes into account the students' cultural and linguistic backgrounds. This can involve incorporating materials and resources that reflect their culture and language, as well as modifying teaching methods to better meet their needs.
5. Family Engagement: Encourage family engagement by providing opportunities for parents to participate in school events and activities. This can help build a sense of community and support for the students.
6. Tutoring and Mentoring: Provide tutoring and mentoring services to help students who may be struggling academically or socially. This can include one-on-one tutoring sessions, study groups, and mentorship programs.
7. Community Resources: Connect students with community resources that can provide additional support, such as health clinics, food banks, and social services.
