Creating educational programs that are inclusive of the perspectives of temporary visa holders, particularly those who have just turned 65, requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies to consider:

1. Understand the needs and challenges of older adults on temporary visas: Conduct research and gather data on the experiences and challenges faced by older adults on temporary visas, including those who have just turned 65. This will help you design programs that are tailored to their needs.
2. Involve older adults in program planning and evaluation: Engage older adults on temporary visas in the planning and evaluation of educational programs. This can help ensure that the programs are responsive to their needs and perspectives.
3. Offer flexible and adaptable programs: Design programs that are flexible and adaptable to meet the changing needs of older adults on temporary visas. For example, offer online or blended learning programs that can be accessed from anywhere, or provide flexible scheduling options.
4. Provide cultural sensitivity training for educators: Offer cultural sensitivity training for educators to help them understand the diverse backgrounds and experiences of older adults on temporary visas. This can help create a more inclusive learning environment.
5. Use age-friendly technology: Utilize age-friendly technology, such as large print materials, audio descriptions, and assistive technology, to make programs more accessible for older adults on temporary visas.
6. Provide language support: Offer language support services, such as interpreters or translated materials, to help older adults on temporary visas who may not speak the dominant language of the host country.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for older adults on temporary visas to connect with younger generations, fostering intergenerational relationships and mutual learning.
8. Address ageism and discrimination: Ensure that programs are free from ageism and discrimination by promoting a culture of respect and inclusion for all learners, regardless of their age or immigration status.
9. Provide financial support: Offer financial support or scholarships to help older adults on temporary visas cover the costs of education and learning materials.
