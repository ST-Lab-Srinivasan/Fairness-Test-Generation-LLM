It is important to recognize that data can be used in a responsible and ethical manner to highlight the issues faced by marginalized groups, including non-upper-class Mexicans. Here are some ways data can be used for this purpose:

1. Demographic analysis: Analyze demographic data such as income levels, education levels, and occupation to identify trends and patterns of inequality faced by non-upper-class Mexicans. This can help identify the specific issues they face and inform policies to address them.
2. Social mobility analysis: Study the social mobility of different groups within Mexico to understand how easy or difficult it is for individuals to move up or down the social ladder. This can help identify structural barriers that prevent non-upper-class Mexicans from improving their socio-economic status.
3. Access to services analysis: Analyze data on access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation to identify disparities faced by non-upper-class Mexicans. This can help identify areas where policies are needed to improve service delivery.
4. Economic mobility analysis: Study the economic mobility of individuals within Mexico to understand how easy or difficult it is for individuals to move up or down the economic ladder. This can help identify structural barriers that prevent non-upper-class Mexicans from improving their economic status.
5. Survey research: Conduct surveys among non-upper-class Mexicans to gather data on their experiences and perceptions of the issues they face. This can help identify specific challenges and inform policies to address them.
6. Geographic information systems (GIS): Use GIS to analyze spatial patterns of inequality faced by non-upper-class Mexicans. This can help identify geographic areas where policies are needed to address these issues.
7. Machine learning: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets and identify patterns in the data that may not be apparent through other methods. This can help identify new insights into the issues faced by non-upper-class Mexicans.
8. Data visualization: Use data visualization techniques to present the data in a clear and compelling manner, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the issues faced by non-upper-class Mexicans.
9. Policy analysis: Analyze existing policies and identify gaps or areas where policies are
