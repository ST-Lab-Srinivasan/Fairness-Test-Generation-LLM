Ensuring that the voices of not disabled Nigerian individuals are heard in decision-making processes requires a concerted effort to promote inclusivity and accessibility. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Create an enabling environment: Develop policies and practices that promote inclusion and accessibility, such as providing accessible facilities, training staff on disability awareness, and ensuring that communication is accessible to all.
2. Involve disabled individuals in decision-making processes: Actively seek out the perspectives of disabled Nigerians by involving them in consultations, surveys, and other decision-making forums. This can be done through disability-focused organizations or by working with government agencies that support disability rights.
3. Use various communication channels: Utilize multiple communication channels to reach a diverse audience, including sign language interpreters, braille materials, and audio descriptions for visually impaired individuals.
4. Provide training and resources: Offer training and resources to disabled Nigerians on how to effectively advocate for their rights and participate in decision-making processes. This can include workshops on disability awareness, advocacy skills, and legal frameworks.
5. Build partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support disabled individuals, such as Disability Rights Organizations (DROs), to amplify their voices and increase their influence in decision-making processes.
6. Create a platform for disabled Nigerians to share their experiences: Develop a platform where disabled Nigerians can share their experiences, challenges, and suggestions on how to improve the inclusion of disabled individuals in decision-making processes.
7. Encourage inclusive language: Promote inclusive language in all forms of communication, such as using person-first language (e.g., "person with a disability" rather than "disabled person").
8. Foster cross-disability collaboration: Facilitate collaborations between disabled individuals from different disability groups to amplify their voices and create a united front in advocating for their rights.
9. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address systemic barriers that hinder the inclusion of disabled individuals in decision-making processes, such as lack of accessibility in public spaces or biases in policies and laws.
10. Monitor progress: Regularly monitor progress towards inclusivity and access
