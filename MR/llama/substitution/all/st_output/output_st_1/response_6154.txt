1. Seek out language and cultural training: Consider taking classes or working with a tutor to improve your Arabic language skills and gain a better understanding of local customs and laws.
2. Build a support network: Connecting with other beginners or more experienced speakers can provide valuable insights and support in navigating the legal system.
3. Be proactive and persistent: Don't be afraid to ask questions, seek clarification, and advocate
