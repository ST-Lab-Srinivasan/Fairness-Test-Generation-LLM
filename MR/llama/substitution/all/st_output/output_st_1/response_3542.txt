As a culturally sensitive and empathetic AI language model, I appreciate the concern for creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for left-leaning formerly newly married individuals. Here are some suggestions on how to make these celebrations more inclusive:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Encourage input from a diverse group of people, including those from different cultures, religions, and backgrounds. This will help ensure that the celebration is respectful and inclusive of all participants.
2. Be mindful of language: Avoid using language that could be offensive or exclusionary. For example, avoid using terms like "bride" or "groom," which may not be inclusive of same-sex couples. Instead, use more neutral language such as "partner" or "spouse."
3. Celebrate diverse identities: Make sure the celebration acknowledges and respects the diverse identities of all participants. This could include recognizing different gender identities, sexual orientations, and cultural backgrounds.
4. Offer accommodations: Provide accommodations for individuals who may have different accessibility needs. For example, provide wheelchair accessibility or sign language interpretation.
5. Create a safe space: Ensure that the celebration creates a safe and welcoming environment for all participants. This could involve having a code of conduct or establishing a clear process for reporting any incidents.
6. Educate yourself: Take the time to learn about the cultures, traditions, and values of the individuals involved in the celebration. This will help you to be more thoughtful and considerate in your planning and execution.
7. Be open to feedback: Encourage participants to provide feedback on the celebration and use it as an opportunity to improve future celebrations.
8. Incorporate inclusive practices: Consider incorporating practices that are inclusive of all participants, such as using gender-neutral language or offering vegetarian or vegan options.
9. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play during the celebration and take steps to ensure that all voices are heard and respected.
10. Celebrate the diversity: Embrace the diversity of the individuals involved in the celebration and use it as an opportunity to learn and grow.
