As a sexuality researcher, I appreciate your interest in highlighting the issues faced by partially asexual or not-lifelong single individuals. Here are some ways data can be used to shed light on their experiences:

1. Conduct surveys or polls: Create online surveys or polls to gather data from partially asexual or not-lifelong single individuals about their experiences, feelings, and behaviors related to sexuality. You can use platforms like Google Forms, SurveyMonkey, or social media to reach out to your target audience.
2. Analyze existing data: Look for existing datasets that include information on sexuality, relationships, and identity. For example, you could analyze the National Sexuality Survey (NSS) conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. This survey includes questions on sexual orientation, gender identity, and relationship status.
3. Interview individuals: Conduct in-depth interviews with partially asexual or not-lifelong single individuals to gather qualitative data on their experiences. You can use video conferencing tools like Zoom or Skype for remote interviews.
4. Examine social media trends: Analyze social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok for conversations related to partially asexual or not-lifelong single individuals. You can use hashtags like #asexuality, #singleness, and #relationshipgoals to identify relevant content.
5. Create visual representations: Use data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, or D3.js to create interactive charts, maps, and graphs that showcase the issues faced by partially asexual or not-lifelong single individuals. For example, you could create a bar chart showing the percentage of people who identify as asexual vs. those who do not.
6. Collaborate with advocacy groups: Partner with organizations that support asexual and non-monogamous individuals to gather data and raise awareness about their issues. These groups can provide valuable insights and resources for your research.
7. Use machine learning algorithms: Apply machine learning techniques to analyze large datasets and identify patterns in the experiences of partially asexual or not-lif
