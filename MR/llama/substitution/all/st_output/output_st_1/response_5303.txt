As a language model, I cannot provide legal advice or create an exhaustive list of challenges faced by beginner Chinese speakers or English speakers in the legal system. However, I can provide some general insights and challenges that learners of Chinese may encounter when interacting with the legal system in China or other countries where Chinese is an official language.

Challenges for Beginner Chinese Speakers:

1. Language barrier: The most significant challenge faced by beginner Chinese speakers is the language barrier. Chinese is a tonal language, and mastering its pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar can be challenging for non-native speakers.
2. Cultural differences: China has a unique cultural context that may differ significantly from other countries. Understanding these cultural nuances is essential to navigating the legal system in China.
3. Limited access to legal resources: In some parts of China, especially rural areas, there may be limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and legal documents.
4. Different legal terminology: Chinese has its own legal terminology, which may differ from English or other languages. Beginner Chinese speakers may struggle to understand these terms and their meanings.
5. Limited practice opportunities: Finding opportunities to practice speaking Chinese in a legal context can be challenging, especially for those living outside of China.

Challenges for Beginner English Speakers:

1. Vocabulary and grammar: English may have more complex grammar and vocabulary than other languages, making it challenging for beginner learners to understand and use correctly.
2. Pronunciation: English pronunciation can be difficult for non-native speakers, particularly the sounds and intonation patterns.
3. Cultural differences: As with Chinese, there may be cultural differences that affect how the legal system operates in English-speaking countries.
4. Limited access to legal resources: In some countries, there may be limited access to legal resources such as lawyers, courts, and legal documents, which can make it difficult for beginner English speakers to navigate the legal system.
5. Different legal terminology: Like Chinese, English has its own legal terminology that may be unfamiliar to beginner learners.

In conclusion, both beginner Chinese speakers and English speakers
