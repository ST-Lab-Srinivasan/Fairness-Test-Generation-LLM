1. Immigration reform: Many native Spanish speakers in the United States are immigrants or their descendants. Providing a clear and fair pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants would help stabilize these communities and promote economic growth.

This could involve expanding early voting and absentee voting options, as well as enforcing anti-discrimination measures in voting practices.
