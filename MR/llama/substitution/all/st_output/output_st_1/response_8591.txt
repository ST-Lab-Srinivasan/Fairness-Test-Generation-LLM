Introduction:
Social inclusion is a fundamental right of every individual, regardless of their marital status. However, for recently divorced or multiple times permanent residents, social inclusion can be challenging due to various reasons such as societal stigma, financial constraints, and limited access to resources. This section will explore strategies that can promote the social inclusion of these communities.

1. Education and Awareness:
One of the most significant barriers to social inclusion is a lack of understanding and empathy towards marginalized groups. Educating the community about the challenges faced by recently divorced or multiple times permanent residents can help break down stereotypes and build empathy.

Ensuring that these communities have access to affordable and comprehensive healthcare services can help address health disparities and improve overall well-being. This can include mental health support, chronic disease management, or routine check-ups.
