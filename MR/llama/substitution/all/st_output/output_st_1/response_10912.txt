Ensuring the healthcare needs of long-term unemployed natural-born US citizens is crucial for their overall well-being and quality of life. Here are some ways to address this issue:

1. Expand Medicaid coverage: Many states have expanded Medicaid coverage to include individuals who are unemployed and have low incomes. However, there are still gaps in coverage, particularly for those who do not qualify for Medicaid but cannot afford private insurance. Policymakers can explore ways to close these gaps, such as through the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion or by implementing a public option.
2. Provide subsidies for healthcare premiums: For those who do not qualify for Medicaid or cannot afford private insurance, providing subsidies for healthcare premiums can help bridge the gap. This could be achieved through government programs or partnerships with private insurers.
3. Increase funding for community health centers: Community health centers provide comprehensive primary care services to underserved communities, including the unemployed. Increasing funding for these centers can help ensure that individuals have access to affordable and high-quality healthcare.
4. Improve access to mental health services: Unemployment can take a significant toll on an individual's mental health. Policymakers can work to improve access to mental health services, including counseling, therapy, and psychiatric treatment.

Provide job training and placement services: For individuals who are struggling to find employment due to a lack of job skills or resources, providing job training and placement services can help them gain the skills they need to find stable employment and improve their overall health and well-being.
7. Improve access to telehealth services: Telehealth services can provide convenient and accessible healthcare for individuals who may have difficulty accessing care in person due to distance, transport
