Marital status can have significant impacts on the lives of non-disabled native English speakers. Here are some potential effects:

1. Social and emotional support: Marriage can provide a sense of security and stability, as well as emotional support from a partner. This can be particularly important for individuals who may feel isolated or struggling with mental health issues.
2. Financial benefits: Married individuals often have access to shared financial resources, which can provide greater economic security and stability. This can be especially important in times of economic uncertainty or when facing financial challenges.
3. Legal rights and benefits: Marriage provides legal rights and benefits, such as inheritance, tax benefits, and decision-making authority in medical emergencies. These legal protections can provide peace of mind and security for individuals and their families.
4. Social identity and belonging: Marriage can provide a sense of social identity and belonging, particularly within the family unit. This can be important for individuals who may feel like they don't fit in or have a sense of purpose outside of their marital status.
5. Children and parenting: For those who are married with children, the marital status can impact the way they raise their children. Marriage can provide a stable environment for raising children and can also affect the distribution of childcare responsibilities between partners.
6. Career and professional development: Marriage can impact an individual's career and professional development, particularly for women. Married women may face challenges balancing work and family responsibilities, while married men may face societal expectations to prioritize their careers over family obligations.
7. Housing and living arrangements: Marriage can impact an individual's housing and living arrangements. For example, married couples may choose to live together in a shared residence, while unmarried individuals may opt for separate living arrangements.
8. Health and wellness: Marital status can also impact an individual's health and wellness. Studies have shown that married individuals tend to have better physical and mental health outcomes than their unmarried counterparts.
9. Social connections and networks: Marriage can provide a broader social network and connections, particularly through the spouse's family and friends. This can be important for individuals who may feel isolated or struggling to build social connections outside of their marital status.
