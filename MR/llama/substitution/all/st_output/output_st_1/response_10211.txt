Ensuring the educational needs of partially identifying as non-binary long-time married students requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies to meet their needs:

1. Inclusive policies: Develop policies that acknowledge and support the diverse gender identities of students, including those who identify as non-binary or partially identify as non-binary. Make sure these policies are communicated clearly and consistently across all educational settings.
