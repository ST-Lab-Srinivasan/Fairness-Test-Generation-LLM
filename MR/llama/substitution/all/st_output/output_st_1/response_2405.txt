Non-upper-class immigrants to the US often face significant challenges in accessing and navigating the healthcare system. Here are some of the common challenges they encounter:

1. Language barriers: Many non-immigrant people may not speak English fluently, which can make it difficult for them to communicate with healthcare providers, navigate medical forms, and understand their treatment options.
2. Cultural barriers: Immigrants may have different cultural beliefs and practices that can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts with healthcare providers. For example, some cultures may have different attitudes towards mental illness, which can affect how they seek help.
