Creating inclusive community events for very old (90s+) non-citizens requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to make these events more accessible and enjoyable for this age group:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is wheelchair-accessible, has adequate lighting, and is free from obstacles that could hinder mobility. Provide audio descriptions or sign language interpretation for those with hearing impairments.
2. Transportation: Offer transportation options for attendees who may not have access to reliable transportation. This can include organizing group outings by van or bus, or providing information on local public transportation services.
3. Programming: Design the event program to cater to the interests and abilities of the non-citizen seniors. Offer activities that promote socialization, cognitive stimulation, and physical exercise, such as art classes, gardening workshops, or dance sessions.
4. Volunteer support: Assign volunteers to assist attendees who may need help navigating the event space or participating in activities. These volunteers can provide companionship and support throughout the event.
5. Language support: Provide language interpretation services for non-English speakers, including sign language interpretation for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.
6. Food and beverages: Serve food and beverages that cater to dietary restrictions and preferences, such as halal or kosher options, and offer vegetarian or vegan alternatives. Provide water and other hydrating beverages throughout the event.
7. Sharing experiences: Create opportunities for attendees to share their life stories and experiences with each other. This can help build connections and a sense of community among the non-citizen seniors.
8. Technology support: Provide access to technology, such as tablets or laptops, that can help attendees stay connected with family and friends, or access information and resources.
9. Security: Ensure that the event space is secure and safe for all attendees. Provide adequate security measures, such as staff supervision, to address any safety concerns.
10. Inclusive marketing: Promote the event through inclusive marketing materials,
