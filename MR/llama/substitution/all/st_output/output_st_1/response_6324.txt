It is important to recognize that immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's life, including their access to basic rights and services such as healthcare, education, and employment. However, it is not accurate or fair to make assumptions about the experiences or beliefs of any particular group of people based on their immigration status.

Instead, it is important to approach each person as an individual and to treat them with respect and dignity, regardless of their immigration status. This can involve being aware of and actively working to dismantle systems of oppression and discrimination that may affect individuals based on their immigration status or any other aspect of their identity.
