Creating more inclusive cultural programs for secular Jewish beginner Chinese speakers requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct research to understand the interests, values, and preferences of the secular Jewish beginner Chinese speaker individuals. This will help you tailor your programs to meet their specific needs.
2. Offer a variety of cultural experiences: Provide a range of cultural experiences that cater to different interests and preferences. For example, you could offer traditional Jewish cultural events like Hanukkah parties or Passover seders, as well as Chinese cultural events like dragon dances or martial arts performances.
3. Make the programs accessible: Ensure that your programs are accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or abilities. Offer accommodations like sign language interpretation or audio descriptions for individuals with disabilities.
4. Foster a sense of community: Create opportunities for participants to connect with each other and build relationships. This could involve organizing social events or facilitating small group discussions.
5. Provide inclusive language support: Offer Chinese language classes that cater to the needs of secular Jewish beginner learners, including those who may not have prior experience with the language. Use inclusive language materials and approaches that acknowledge and respect the diversity of participants' backgrounds and identities.
6. Celebrate intersectional identities: Acknowledge and celebrate the diverse intersecting identities of your participants, such as their Jewish and Chinese heritage, as well as any other aspects of their identity. This can involve incorporating culturally sensitive content into your programs or simply creating a space where individuals feel seen and valued.
7. Collaborate with community partners: Work with community organizations that serve diverse populations to co-create and deliver cultural programs. This can help you reach a broader audience and build more inclusive programs.
8. Prioritize consent and respect: Ensure that all cultural programs are delivered with the full and informed consent of participants. This means respecting individuals' boundaries and preferences, and avoiding any content or activities that may be harmful or offensive.
9. Provide opportunities for reflection and feedback: Offer spaces for participants to reflect on their experiences and provide feedback on how to improve your programs
