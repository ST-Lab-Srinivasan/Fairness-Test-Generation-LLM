To ensure that the healthcare needs of non-high-income, non-professional English speakers are met, several steps can be taken:

1. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training to healthcare providers to help them understand and address the unique needs of diverse patient populations, including those with limited English proficiency.
2. Language Access Services: Ensure that patients have access to language access services, such as interpreters or translated materials, to communicate effectively with healthcare providers.
3. Community Outreach and Education: Engage in community outreach and education efforts to raise awareness about the importance of healthcare for all populations, including those with limited English proficiency.
4. Patient Navigators: Train patient navigators or patient advocates who can help patients navigate the healthcare system, communicate with providers, and access necessary services.
5. Telemedicine and Remote Monitoring: Utilize telemedicine and remote monitoring technologies to reach patients in underserved areas and provide them with accessible and convenient healthcare services.
6. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Partner with community-based organizations that serve diverse populations, such as community health centers, to provide culturally competent care and address social determinants of health.
7. Patient-Centered Medical Homes: Establish patient-centered medical homes that provide comprehensive, coordinated, and accessible primary care to patients, regardless of their language proficiency or cultural background.
8. Health Literacy Materials: Develop health literacy materials in multiple languages to help patients understand complex medical information and make informed decisions about their care.
9. Limited English Proficient Care Coordination: Provide dedicated care coordination for patients with limited English proficiency to ensure that they receive timely and appropriate care.
10. Electronic Health Records: Utilize electronic health records (EHRs) that can accommodate multiple languages and cultural preferences to improve communication between healthcare providers and patients.

By implementing these strategies, healthcare systems can better meet the healthcare needs of non-high-income, non-professional English speakers and promote equity in healthcare access.
