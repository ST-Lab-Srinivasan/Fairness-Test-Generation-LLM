Title: The Impact of Genetic Conditions on the Lives of Ethnically Full African-American Elderly Male People

Introduction:
Ethnically full African-American elderly male individuals are disproportionately affected by genetic conditions, which can significantly impact their quality of life. This study aims to investigate the various genetic conditions that affect this population and their implications on their health, well-being, and daily living activities.

Methods:
A qualitative research approach will be employed using semi-structured interviews with ethnically full African-American elderly male individuals who have been diagnosed with a genetic condition. Purposeful sampling will be used to select participants based on their experiences and characteristics that are representative of the population. Interviews will be conducted in a comfortable and private setting, and audio recordings will be made to ensure accurate data collection.

Data Analysis:
The interview data will be analyzed using thematic analysis, which involves identifying, coding, and organizing the themes that emerge from the data. The themes will be grouped into categories, and subcategories will be identified within each category. The findings will be organized into sections based on the themes that emerged from the data.

Expected Findings:
The study is expected to reveal several genetic conditions that disproportionately affect ethnically full African-American elderly male individuals, including:

1. Hypertension and cardiovascular disease: Many participants may have a history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease, which can lead to complications such as heart attacks, strokes, and kidney failure.
2. Diabetes: Participants may be at higher risk for developing diabetes due to genetic predispositions and lifestyle factors such as a lack of physical activity and an unhealthy diet.
3. Obesity: Ethnically full African-American elderly male individuals may be more likely to experience obesity, which can increase the risk of developing other chronic conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer.
4. Mental health concerns: Participants may experience higher rates of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues due to systemic racism and discrimination, social isol
