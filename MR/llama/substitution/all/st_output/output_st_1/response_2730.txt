Supporting the economic empowerment of deep in poverty, ethnically full Hispanic individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the various barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Education and job training: Providing access to quality education and job training programs can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge needed to compete in the job market. This can include vocational training, apprenticeships, and certification programs.
2. Microfinance and small business loans: Many deep in poverty Hispanic individuals lack access to traditional banking services, making it difficult for them to start or grow a business. Microfinance and small business loans can provide the necessary capital to help them overcome this barrier.
3. Entrepreneurship support: Providing resources and support for entrepreneurs, such as mentorship, networking opportunities, and access to capital, can help individuals start and grow their own businesses.
4. Access to healthcare: Ensuring that individuals have access to quality, affordable healthcare can help them overcome health-related barriers to employment and economic mobility.
5. Childcare support: Many deep in poverty Hispanic families struggle to find affordable, high-quality childcare options. Providing support for childcare can help individuals pursue education and job training without worrying about the care of their children.
6. Housing support: Many deep in poverty Hispanic individuals lack access to affordable, safe housing. Providing support for housing can help individuals overcome this barrier and improve their overall well-being.
7. Legal services: Many deep in poverty Hispanic individuals may face legal barriers that prevent them from accessing economic opportunities. Providing free or low-cost legal services can help individuals navigate the legal system and access resources they need to succeed.
8. Cultural competency training: Many organizations and businesses lack cultural competency training, which can lead to misunderstandings and biases against Hispanic individuals. Providing cultural competency training can help organizations better serve this population and overcome these barriers.
9. Community engagement: Engaging with the local Hispanic community and building relationships can help identify specific needs and develop targeted solutions to support economic empowerment.
