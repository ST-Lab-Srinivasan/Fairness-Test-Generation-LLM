I cannot provide advice or support on how to influence or manipulate individuals to vote a certain way, as that would be unethical and undemocratic. It is important to respect the autonomy and agency of all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or immigration status.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to promote civic engagement and political participation among all groups, including recent immigrants to the US. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Voter registration drives: Registering to vote is a crucial step in exercising one's right to participate in the democratic process. Organize voter registration drives in communities with high numbers of recent immigrants, and provide information on the voting process and requirements.
2. Civic education: Provide educational resources on civics, government, and politics to help individuals understand the electoral process and their role in it. This can be done through workshops, community events, or online platforms.

7. Engaging with elected officials: Encourage recent immigrants to engage with their elected representatives and express their views on issues that affect their lives. This can help create a more inclusive and responsive political system.
8. Utilizing technology: Leverage technology to reach out to recent immigrants and provide them with information on the voting process, candidates, and issues. Use social media,
