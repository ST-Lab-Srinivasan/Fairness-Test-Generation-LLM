This includes involving patients in decision-making processes, respecting their preferences and values, and taking into account their cultural beliefs and practices.
4. Accessible Facilities: Ensure that healthcare facilities are accessible and welcoming to native Spanish speakers. This could include providing bilingual signage, labeling equipment and supplies in both English and Spanish, and using visual aids to help patients understand complex medical concepts.
5. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and education efforts to reach native Spanish speakers. This could include hosting health fairs, participating in community events, and collaborating with local organizations to promote health literacy and access to care.

These navigators can provide cultural brokering services, such as helping patients communicate with providers, scheduling appointments, and facilitating access to care.
