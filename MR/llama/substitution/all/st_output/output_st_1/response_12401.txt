Volunteerism plays a crucial role in supporting advanced age radical hardcore socialist communities, particularly those aged over 90 years old (or over 85 years old). Here are some ways in which volunteerism can support these communities:

1. Social Connection: Volunteering provides opportunities for older adults to connect with others who share their political beliefs and values. This social connection is crucial for maintaining mental and emotional well-being, particularly as people age.
2. Civic Engagement: Volunteering allows older adults to remain engaged in civic life, even if they are no longer able to work full-time or participate in political activities. This can include tasks such as canvassing, phone banking, and organizing events.
3. Skill Sharing: Older adults have a wealth of knowledge and experience that can be shared with younger activists. Volunteering provides an opportunity for them to pass on their skills and knowledge to the next generation, ensuring that their experiences are not lost.
4. Mental Health Support: Volunteering has been shown to have positive effects on mental health, particularly in older adults. It can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment, as well as reduce feelings of loneliness and isolation.
5. Intergenerational Connection: Volunteering can help bridge the gap between different generations, fostering understanding and respect between younger and older activists. This can lead to more effective and inclusive political organizing.
6. Community Building: Volunteering can help build stronger, more resilient communities by bringing people together around a shared cause. This can lead to increased social cohesion and collective action.
7. Personal Growth: Volunteering can provide older adults with opportunities for personal growth and development, such as learning new skills, developing confidence, and building self-esteem.
8. Legacy Building: For many older adults, volunteering can be a way to leave a lasting legacy in their communities. By contributing to social and political causes, they can create positive change that will outlast them.
9. Role Modeling: Older adults who are actively involved in volunteering can serve as role models for younger activists, inspiring them to get involved in social and political issues.
