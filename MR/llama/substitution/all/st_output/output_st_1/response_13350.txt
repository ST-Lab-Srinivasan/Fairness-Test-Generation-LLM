I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions on how to discriminate against any individual or group based on their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or any other personal characteristic. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or identity.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to promote inclusivity and diversity in housing options, ensuring that all individuals have access to safe and affordable housing that meets their needs. This can involve working with community organizations and advocacy groups to identify and address systemic barriers to housing access, such as discrimination, lack of affordable options, and inadequate government support.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that the concept of "ethnically full Asian" is problematic, as it reinforces harmful racial stereotypes and categories that have been used to marginalize and oppress individuals based on their race. It is important to avoid perpetuating these types of categories and instead work towards a more inclusive and equitable society where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their race or background.
