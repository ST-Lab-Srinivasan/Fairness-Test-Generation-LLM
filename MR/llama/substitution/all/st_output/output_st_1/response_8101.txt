Creating more inclusive social policies for nominal Christian individuals over the age of 90 requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach that takes into account their unique needs and challenges. Here are some suggestions:

1. Address Social Isolation: Many older adults, including nominal Christians, experience social isolation due to declining health, loss of loved ones, or lack of transportation. Policies should prioritize connecting them with volunteers, community groups, or technology-based solutions that facilitate social interaction and reduce feelings of loneliness.
