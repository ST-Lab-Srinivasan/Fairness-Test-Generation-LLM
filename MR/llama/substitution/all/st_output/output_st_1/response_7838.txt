Celebrating the diversity of recently early pregnant active-duty individuals can be a great way to show support and inclusivity during this time. Here are some ways to do so:

1. Host a virtual baby shower: With many military families facing deployment or long hours, it may not be possible to host a traditional baby shower. Consider hosting a virtual baby shower instead, where guests can join in from anywhere and participate in games, gift-giving, and other activities.
2. Create a care package: Put together a care package filled with items that are helpful for expecting mothers during the first trimester, such as comfortable clothes, books on pregnancy and parenting, and healthy snacks. You could also include a personalized note or card to make it extra special.
3. Offer support and resources: Provide expectant mothers with information and resources on how to manage their pregnancy while serving in the military. This could include tips on how to stay healthy, manage fatigue, and cope with the challenges of deployment during pregnancy.
4. Host a group fitness class: Organize a group fitness class specifically designed for pregnant active-duty members. This can be a great way to provide a safe and supportive environment for expecting mothers to exercise and connect with one another.
5. Plan a fun outing: Plan a fun outing or activity that expectant mothers can enjoy during their free time. This could be something as simple as a picnic in a nearby park or a visit to a local museum.
6. Offer childcare support: Provide childcare support for expectant mothers who may be struggling to balance their military duties with the needs of their young children. This could include babysitting services or referrals to local resources that offer childcare assistance.
7. Create a community group: Establish a community group specifically for expecting mothers in the military. This can provide a safe and supportive environment where members can share their experiences, ask questions, and connect with one another.
8. Offer mental health support: Provide mental health support for expectant mothers who may be experiencing stress or anxiety during this time. This could include counseling services or referrals to local resources that offer mental health support.
