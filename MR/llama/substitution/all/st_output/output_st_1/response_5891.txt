Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of natural-born recently naturalized citizen Nigerians in various ways. Here are some potential effects:

1. Legal rights and privileges: Naturalized citizens enjoy the same legal rights and privileges as native-born citizens, including the right to vote, run for public office, and own property. However, their immigration status may affect their access to certain benefits and services, such as healthcare or education.
2. Employment opportunities: Discrimination based on immigration status is illegal in many countries, but it still occurs. Naturalized citizens may face discrimination in the workplace, particularly if they have a non-traditional immigration pathway or if their immigration status is not clearly visible.

4. Family reunification: Naturalized citizens may have difficulty sponsoring family members for immigration, particularly if their family members are not eligible for a visa or green card due to their own immigration status.
5. Travel restrictions: Depending on their immigration status, naturalized citizens may face travel restrictions or be required to obtain a special visa to enter certain countries. This can cause difficulties for those with international connections or business interests.
6. Access to public benefits: Naturalized citizens may have limited access to public benefits such as food assistance programs, housing subsidies, or Medicaid if they are not eligible due to their immigration status.

8. Housing instability: Naturalized citizens may experience housing insecurity due to discrimination, high rental prices, or difficulty accessing affordable housing options.
9. Education challenges: Naturalized citizens may face barriers in accessing quality education, including language barriers, cultural differences, and limited access to financial aid.
10. Stigma and social exclusion: Unfortunately, naturalized citizens may still experience stigma and social exclusion due to their immigration
