Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have far-reaching consequences on an individual's emotional, social, and economic well-being. When a spouse passes away, the surviving partner may experience a range of emotions, including grief, loneliness, and isolation. As they navigate their new status as a widow or widower, they may face unique challenges that can impact their overall quality of life. This study aims to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of long-term recently widowed independent individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that the loss of a spouse can have significant psychological, social, and economic consequences for the surviving partner. Widows and widowers may experience grief, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Koening & Sokol, 2017). They may also face challenges in maintaining their social networks, as they may feel isolated or disconnected from their friends and family (Lukas et al., 2015).

In terms of economic impacts, widows and widowers may experience a decline in their standard of living, particularly if they relied on their spouse for financial support (Trawick-Smith & Kuhfeld, 2014). They may also face challenges in managing their finances, as they may be unfamiliar with budgeting and financial planning without their spouse (Brown et al., 2013).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with long-term recently widowed independent individuals. Participants will be recruited through local support groups for widows and widowers, as well as online forums and social media platforms. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, allowing for a rich and nuanced understanding of the participants' experiences.

Results:
The results of this study will highlight the specific challenges faced by long-term recently widowed independent individuals in various domains, including emotional and social well-being, financial stability, and overall quality of life. The findings will provide insights into the ways in which marital status can impact an individual's
