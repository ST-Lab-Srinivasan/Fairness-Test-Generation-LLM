Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native Spanish speakers and recent immigrants to the US requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some strategies that organizations and institutions can consider:

1. Listen and engage with the community: Conduct research and outreach to better understand the needs and preferences of the target audience. Engage with community members through focus groups, surveys, and other methods to gather feedback and insights.
2. Be culturally sensitive: Be aware of the cultural differences and nuances between the native Spanish-speaking communities and the US mainstream culture. Avoid stereotyping or assuming that all native Spanish speakers share the same cultural practices and values.
3. Provide language support: Offer interpreters, translators, and language classes to help recent immigrants navigate the program and access services. Make sure that all materials are available in multiple languages, including Spanish, and that communication is accessible to people with different language proficiency levels.
4. Foster intercultural dialogue: Create opportunities for native Spanish speakers and recent immigrants to share their experiences, traditions, and perspectives with each other. Encourage cross-cultural exchange and understanding through events, workshops, and other activities.
5. Incorporate diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural programs reflect the diversity of native Spanish speakers and recent immigrants. Use diverse imagery, symbols, and stories in marketing materials, exhibits, and other program elements.
6. Make inclusive spaces: Design physical spaces that are accessible and welcoming to everyone, regardless of their language proficiency or cultural background. Provide comfortable and private areas for people to rest or take breaks during events or programs.
7. Offer culturally sensitive content: Develop programming that is relevant and meaningful to native Spanish speakers and recent immigrants. Avoid perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing dominant cultural narratives.
8. Collaborate with community partners: Work with local organizations and groups that serve native Spanish-speaking communities and recent immigrants. Leverage their expertise and networks to create more inclusive programs.
9. Provide support services: Offer additional resources and services, such as mental health counseling, legal aid, or job training
