To ensure that the educational needs of natural-born Canadian citizens who have just turned 65 are met, here are some possible strategies:

1. Develop age-appropriate curricula: Create curricula that cater to the cognitive and physical abilities of older adults, taking into account their life experiences and interests.
2. Offer flexible learning options: Provide flexible learning options such as part-time or online courses, which can accommodate the schedules of older adults who may have other commitments such as work, family, or health issues.
3. Provide access to technology: Ensure that older adults have access to technology such as computers, tablets, and smartphones, which can help them navigate online courses and resources.
4. Encourage intergenerational learning: Facilitate opportunities for older adults to learn from younger generations, fostering intergenerational connections and knowledge sharing.
5. Address barriers to education: Identify and address any barriers to education faced by older adults, such as lack of transportation, childcare responsibilities, or financial constraints.
6. Promote lifelong learning: Encourage older adults to pursue lifelong learning, highlighting the cognitive benefits of continued learning and personal growth.
7. Offer support services: Provide support services such as academic advising, mental health counseling, and financial assistance to help older adults navigate the educational system.
8. Create age-friendly campuses: Design campuses that are accessible and inclusive for older adults, with features such as ramps, elevators, and accessible washrooms.
9. Engage with community partners: Collaborate with community organizations and service providers to offer a range of educational opportunities for older adults, including those outside of traditional academic settings.
10. Advocate for policy change: Advocate for policies that support the educational needs of older adults, such as age-based funding models or targeted financial assistance programs.

By implementing these strategies, educational institutions can help ensure that the educational needs of natural-born Canadian citizens who have just turned 65 are met and that they are able to continue learning and growing throughout their lives.
