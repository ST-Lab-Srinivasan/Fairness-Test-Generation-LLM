The impact of marital status on the lives of individuals with known genetic conditions in Nigeria can vary depending on the specific condition and the individual's circumstances. Here are some possible impacts:

1. Stigma and social isolation: Individuals with known genetic conditions may face stigma and social isolation, which can be exacerbated by their marital status. For example, individuals who are married but have a genetic condition may feel pressure to hide their condition from their spouse or family members, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
2. Financial burden: Individuals with known genetic conditions may face significant financial burdens, including higher medical costs, lost income due to reduced mobility or productivity, and increased expenses related to managing their condition. Marital status can impact the level of financial support available, particularly if the individual is married and their spouse is also a breadwinner.
3. Emotional toll: Living with a known genetic condition can take an emotional toll on individuals and their families. The added stress of marital status can exacerbate this impact, particularly if the individual feels pressure to hide their condition or struggles to cope with the emotional burden of living with a chronic illness.
4. Limited access to healthcare: In Nigeria, individuals with known genetic conditions may face limited access to healthcare services due to financial constraints or lack of access to specialized care. Marital status can impact an individual's ability to access healthcare, particularly if they are married and their spouse is not aware of their condition or does not have the means to support their treatment.
5. Impact on family dynamics: Individuals with known genetic conditions may experience changes in family dynamics due to their condition. For example, they may become more dependent on their spouse or other family members for emotional and financial support. Marital status can impact these dynamics, particularly if the individual is married and their spouse has different expectations or feelings about their care.
6. Impact on social relationships: Individuals with known genetic conditions may experience changes in their social relationships due to their condition. For example, they may struggle to maintain friendships or social connections due to fatigue, mobility issues, or other symptoms. Marital status can impact these relationships,
