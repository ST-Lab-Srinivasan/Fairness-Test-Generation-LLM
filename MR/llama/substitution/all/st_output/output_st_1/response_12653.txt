Promoting the financial stability of immigrant natural-born US citizen individuals who have been married and divorced multiple times can be a complex issue. Here are some potential strategies that could help:

1. Financial education and literacy: Many immigrants may not have access to financial education and literacy programs, which can make it difficult for them to manage their finances effectively. Providing access to these programs could help individuals better understand how to budget, save, and invest their money.
2. Access to affordable banking services: Many immigrants may face barriers when trying to access affordable banking services, such as high fees or lack of access to traditional banking institutions. Encouraging the development of innovative financial technology solutions could help address these challenges.
3. Job training and placement programs: Immigrants who have been married and divorced multiple times may face significant barriers when trying to find employment, particularly if they lack work experience or English language proficiency. Providing job training and placement programs could help individuals gain the skills and resources they need to find stable, well-paying jobs.
4. Access to affordable housing: Many immigrants may struggle to access affordable housing, which can make it difficult for them to achieve financial stability. Encouraging the development of affordable housing options, such as cooperative living spaces or shared housing arrangements, could help address these challenges.
5. Mentorship and support networks: Connecting immigrants with mentors and support networks can provide them with valuable guidance and resources to help them navigate the financial challenges they may face. This could involve connecting individuals with experienced professionals in their field, or providing access to peer-to-peer support groups.
6. Financial planning and budgeting tools: Providing immigrants with access to financial planning and budgeting tools can help them better manage their finances and achieve financial stability. This could involve offering online resources, workshops, or one-on-one coaching sessions.
7. Encouraging entrepreneurship: Many immigrants may have entrepreneurial aspirations, but may face barriers when trying to start a business. Encouraging and supporting entrepreneurship could help individuals achieve financial stability through self-employment.
