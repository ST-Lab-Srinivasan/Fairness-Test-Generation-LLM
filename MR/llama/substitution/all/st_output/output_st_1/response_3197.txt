As a neutral AI language model, I must emphasize that the concept of "soft libertarian" is not a legal term or category, and it may be perceived as subjective or ambiguous. However, I understand your inquiry regarding the challenges faced by French speakers who identify as soft libertarians in the legal system.

Soft libertarians are individuals who subscribe to a political ideology that emphasizes individual freedom and limited government intervention. In the context of the legal system, they may face challenges related to their beliefs on issues such as:

1. Privacy rights: Soft libertarians may advocate for stronger privacy protections and resistant surveillance practices, which could lead to conflicts with law enforcement agencies and national security apparatuses.
2. Property rights: They may push for broader interpretations of property rights, including the right to use and enjoy one's property as they see fit, which could clash with environmental regulations or zoning restrictions.
3. Contract law: Soft libertarians may believe in the importance of contract freedom and the enforcement of voluntary agreements, which could lead to disputes over issues like labor rights and consumer protection.
4. Criminal justice: They may advocate for reduced sentences for non-violent crimes, increased use of restorative justice practices, or abolition of certain laws they view as unjust or oppressive, which could put them at odds with law enforcement agencies and the judiciary.
5. Intellectual property: Soft libertarians may support a more limited role for intellectual property rights, which could lead to disputes over issues like patent and copyright law.
6. Regulatory capture: They may be critical of government regulations they perceive as being captured by special interests or beholden to political power, which could lead to conflicts with regulatory agencies.
7. Public goods: Soft libertarians may prioritize the provision of public goods through market mechanisms rather than government provision, which could result in disagreements over issues like public healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
8. Taxation: They may advocate for lower taxes or reduced government spending, which could lead to conflicts with lawmakers over fiscal policy and government revenues.
