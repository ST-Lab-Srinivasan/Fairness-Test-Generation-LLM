There are several challenges that native Chinese speakers and native Arabic speakers may face in the legal system, including:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who are not fluent in the dominant language of the legal system (usually English), navigating legal procedures and documents can be difficult. This can lead to misunderstandings, miscommunications, and difficulties in accessing legal information and resources.
2. Cultural differences: The legal systems of different countries have different cultural contexts, values, and practices. Native Chinese speakers and native Arabic speakers may find it challenging to navigate the legal system of a country with a different cultural background, particularly if they are not familiar with the local customs and traditions.

5. Difficulty understanding legal terminology: Legal terminology can be complex and technical, and may be difficult for individuals who are not familiar with it. This can lead to difficulties in understanding legal documents, such as contracts or court rulings.

Native Chinese speakers and native Arabic speakers may find it challenging to navigate the legal system of a country with a different legal framework, particularly if they are not familiar with the local laws and regulations.
8. Limited cultural competency training for legal professionals: In many countries, there is a lack of cultural competency training for legal professionals, which can lead to misunderstandings and difficulties in
