The impact of disability status on the lives of non-disabled active-duty military personnel can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Stigma and discrimination: Non-disabled service members may face stigma or discrimination due to their association with individuals with disabilities. This can lead to feelings of isolation, marginalization, or even bullying.
2. Lack of understanding and empathy: Without personal experience with disability, non-disabled service members may lack a deeper understanding and empathy for the challenges faced by their disabled peers. This can result in inadequate support or accommodations for individuals with disabilities within the military community.
3. Limited career advancement opportunities: Non-disabled service members may face barriers to career advancement if they are perceived as a liability or burden due to their lack of disability. This can result in limited promotion opportunities or a lack of access to specialized training or education.
4. Social isolation: Disabled and non-disabled service members may experience social isolation within the military community due to societal attitudes and stigma surrounding disability. This can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, or anxiety among both groups.
5. Inadequate support systems: Non-disabled service members may not have access to the same level of support systems as their disabled peers, such as disability accommodations or mental health resources. This can exacerbate feelings of isolation or marginalization within the military community.
6. Stereotyping and assumptions: Disabled and non-disabled service members may be subject to stereotypes or assumptions based on their disability status. These can lead to inaccurate assumptions about their abilities, limitations, or potential within the military.
7. Difficulty navigating military policies and procedures: Non-disabled service members may face challenges navigating military policies and procedures due to a lack of understanding or familiarity with disability-related issues. This can result in delays or obstacles when trying to access disability accommodations or support.
8. Limited representation in leadership positions: Disabled and non-disabled service members may face barriers to advancement in leadership positions within the military due to societal attitudes or stereotypes
