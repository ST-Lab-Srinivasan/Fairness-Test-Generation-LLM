As an empathetic and unbiased AI language model, I must emphasize that every individual has the right to access quality healthcare regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Here are some suggestions on how to ensure that the healthcare needs of strictly fully asexual advanced individuals aged 65 or older (or over 85) are met:

1. Inclusive Healthcare Services: Ensure that healthcare services are inclusive and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Provide training to healthcare providers on LGBTQ+ issues and cultural competency to address the unique needs of asexual individuals.
2. Accessible Healthcare Facilities: Ensure that healthcare facilities are accessible and inclusive for individuals with mobility impairments or other disabilities. Provide accessible waiting areas, examination rooms, and restrooms to accommodate asexual individuals who may require additional assistance.
3. Personalized Care: Asexual individuals may have specific healthcare needs that are unique to their identity. Ensure that healthcare providers take the time to listen to their patients' concerns and provide personalized care tailored to their individual needs.
4. Age-Appropriate Healthcare: As asexual advanced individuals age, they may require additional healthcare services specifically designed for older adults. Ensure that healthcare providers are aware of these age-appropriate healthcare needs and address them accordingly.
5. Support Network: Asexual individuals may face social isolation or discrimination, which can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being. Provide a support network for asexual advanced individuals, including peer support groups or counseling services, to help them cope with these challenges.
6. Education and Advocacy: Educate healthcare providers, family members, and caregivers about the specific healthcare needs of asexual advanced individuals. Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusivity and respect for LGBTQ+ individuals in the healthcare system.
7. Health Promotion: Encourage asexual advanced individuals to prioritize their health through regular check-ups, screenings, and preventive care. Provide resources and support for healthy lifestyle choices, such as nutrition counseling or exercise
