Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Arabic speakers with mixed Caucasian heritage requires an understanding of the diverse backgrounds and experiences of this community. Here are some suggestions to make these programs more inclusive:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Ensure that the cultural programs include a variety of voices and viewpoints from different Arab cultures, including those from North Africa, the Middle East, and the Arabian Peninsula. This will help create a more nuanced understanding of Arab culture and avoid stereotypes.
2. Be mindful of language: Use inclusive language that acknowledges the diverse backgrounds of participants. Avoid using terms like "Arabic speaker" or "Arab" that can be alienating for individuals who do not identify with these labels. Instead, use language that is respectful and inclusive, such as " beginner Arabic learners" or "individuals with mixed Caucasian heritage."
3. Use accessible materials: Provide learning materials that are relevant to the diverse backgrounds of participants. For example, include images and examples that reflect the different cultures and traditions of the Middle East and North Africa.
4. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a welcoming and inclusive environment where all participants feel valued and respected. Encourage dialogue and collaboration among participants to foster a sense of community and shared learning.
5. Offer tailored programming: Develop programs that cater to the specific interests and needs of beginner Arabic learners with mixed Caucasian heritage. For example, offer courses that focus on the Arabic language as it is spoken in different countries or regions.
6. Engage with diverse communities: Collaborate with local communities and organizations to create cultural programs that are relevant and meaningful to participants. This can include partnering with mosques, community centers, or cultural festivals to reach a wider audience.
7. Provide opportunities for cultural immersion: Offer opportunities for participants to immerse themselves in Arab culture through activities such as language exchange programs, cultural events, or homestays with Arab families.
8. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diversity of participant's backgrounds and experiences by incorporating elements of different cultures into the program. For example, include traditional music, dance
