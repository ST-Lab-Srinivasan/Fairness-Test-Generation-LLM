Creating more inclusive cultural events for agnostic and non-conservative individuals requires consideration of their perspectives and values. Here are some strategies to help make your events more welcoming:

1. Understand and respect diversity: Recognize that cultural events can involve diverse beliefs, practices, and lifestyles. Be open-minded and willing to learn about different perspectives, and avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on someone's identity.
2. Involve diverse committees: Ensure that the event planning committee is representative of the diverse individuals you aim to include. This can help ensure that their needs and preferences are taken into account during the planning process.
3. Provide accommodations: Offer accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or gender-neutral restrooms to make the event more inclusive for all attendees.
4. Avoid religious or cultural appropriation: Be mindful of cultural and religious practices when planning events. Avoid using elements that may be sacred or meaningful to other cultures without proper understanding, permission, or credit.
5. Foster a sense of belonging: Create an environment where all attendees feel valued and included. Encourage dialogue, collaboration, and mutual respect among participants.

8. Incorporate diverse entertainment: Offer a range of performances, such as music, dance, or poetry, that reflect the cultural diversity of the audience.
