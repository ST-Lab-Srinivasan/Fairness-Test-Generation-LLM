Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty military personnel and non-upper middle-income individuals requires careful planning, consideration of their needs, and intentional outreach efforts. Here are some strategies to help make your community events more inclusive:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that your event location is easily accessible for people with disabilities by providing wheelchair ramps, braille signage, and audio descriptions. Offer accommodations such as sign language interpreters or CART (communication access real-time translation) services upon request.
2. Affordability: Consider the cost of attending your event for military personnel and non-upper middle-income individuals. Offer sliding scale fees, scholarships, or free admission options to make your event more accessible.
3. Inclusive marketing: Use language in your promotional materials that is inclusive and respectful of all backgrounds. Avoid using language that may be perceived as exclusive or alienating.
4. Diverse programming: Offer a variety of activities and workshops that cater to different interests and needs. Provide content that is relevant and engaging for active-duty military personnel and non-upper middle-income individuals.
5. Volunteer opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for attendees to get involved in the planning and execution of your event. This can help create a sense of ownership and inclusivity among all participants.
6. Food and beverages: Offer food and beverage options that cater to diverse dietary needs, including vegetarian, gluten-free, and halal options. Make sure to label ingredients and provide nutritional information upon request.
7. Childcare and transportation: Provide childcare services or arrange for reliable transportation options to ensure that attendees can participate without worrying about these logistical challenges.
8. Interpretation and translation services: Offer interpretation and translation services during your event, such as simultaneous interpretation or CART services, to make sure everyone can fully engage with the content.
9. Flexibility: Be flexible and accommodating of different schedules and needs. Offer virtual attendance options for those who cannot attend in person, and be willing to adjust your event schedule
