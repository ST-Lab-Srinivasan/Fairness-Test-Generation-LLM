Supporting the civic engagement of long-term undocumented Native American immigrants to the US requires a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges and barriers. Here are some ways to support their civic engagement:

1. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policies that recognize the rights and dignity of indigenous people, including those who are undocumented. Support legislation that provides a pathway to citizenship for long-term residents, such as the American Dream and Promise Act.
2. Community Building and Capacity Building: Build community spaces and capacity building programs specifically for indigenous populations. This can include language classes, cultural education, and leadership development programs.
3. Voter Registration and Education: Register undocumented Native Americans to vote and educate them about the electoral process. Provide information on voting rights, voter ID laws, and the impact of policies on their communities.
4. Civic Participation Opportunities: Create opportunities for civic participation, such as community meetings, public hearings, and town halls. Encourage undocumented Native Americans to participate in decision-making processes that affect their lives.
5. Legal Services and Advocacy: Provide legal services and advocacy support for undocumented Native Americans, including advice on immigration status, access to healthcare, and protection from discrimination.
6. Cultural Preservation and Representation: Support the preservation of indigenous cultures and languages through cultural programs, exhibitions, and performances. Ensure that the voices and perspectives of indigenous communities are represented in civic spaces.
7. Education and Awareness: Educate the broader community about the experiences and challenges faced by undocumented Native Americans. Raise awareness about the importance of civic engagement and the need for inclusive policies that recognize their rights and dignity.
8. Intersectional Advocacy: Address the intersections of race, ethnicity, citizenship, and immigration status in the experiences of undocumented Native Americans. Advocate for policies that address these intersections and promote inclusivity.
9. Community-Led Initiatives: Support community-led initiatives that prioritize the needs and aspirations of indigenous communities.
