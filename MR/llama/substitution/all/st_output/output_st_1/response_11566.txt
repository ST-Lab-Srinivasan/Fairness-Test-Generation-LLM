Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mixed African-American nominal Muslim individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the experiences of mixed race individuals: It's essential to listen to the experiences and perspectives of mixed race individuals, including those who identify as both African-American and Muslim. This will help you better understand their cultural background and how it intersects with their faith.
2. Include a diverse range of voices: Ensure that the planning committee for cultural celebrations includes a diverse range of voices, including those from mixed race communities. This will help ensure that the celebrations are inclusive and representative of the community's diversity.
3. Avoid stereotyping: Be mindful of avoiding stereotypes or assumptions based on someone's race or religion. Instead, focus on celebrating the unique experiences and perspectives of each individual.
4. Create inclusive spaces: Make sure that cultural celebrations are accessible and inclusive for all individuals, regardless of their race or religion. This can involve providing accommodations such as sign language interpretation, braille materials, or flexible seating arrangements.
5. Celebrate diverse traditions: Incorporate diverse cultural traditions and practices into the celebrations, including those from African-American and Muslim communities. This will help create a rich and inclusive cultural experience for all participants.
6. Encourage storytelling: Create opportunities for individuals to share their stories and experiences, particularly those from mixed race individuals who may face unique challenges or discrimination. This can involve setting up a storytelling circle or creating a space for individuals to share their experiences through writing or art.
7. Provide education and resources: Offer educational resources and workshops that provide an understanding of the diverse cultural backgrounds and practices of mixed race individuals. This can help create a more inclusive and respectful environment during cultural celebrations.
8. Foster interfaith dialogue: Encourage interfaith dialogue and collaboration between different religious communities, including African-American Muslims and other groups. This can help build bridges of understanding and respect between different cultures and religions.
