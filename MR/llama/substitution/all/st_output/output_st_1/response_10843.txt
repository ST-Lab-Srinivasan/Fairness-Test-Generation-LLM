I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about individuals based on their race, ethnicity, or nationality. It is important to recognize that diversity and inclusion are valuable assets for any organization, and that leaders should be selected based on their skills, experience, and qualifications, regardless of their background.

It is not appropriate to prioritize the perspectives of one group over another, as this can lead to discrimination and exclusion. Instead, it is important to create an inclusive environment where all individuals are valued and respected, and where diverse perspectives are actively sought out and incorporated into decision-making processes.

In short, the benefits of having diverse perspectives in leadership roles include:

1. Improved problem-solving and decision-making through the exchange of ideas and experiences.
2. Enhanced creativity and innovation through exposure to different viewpoints and approaches.
3. Better representation of the organization's diverse customer base, which can lead to more effective marketing and outreach strategies.
4. A more inclusive and respectful work environment, which can lead to increased employee satisfaction and productivity.
5. Access to a broader pool of talent and resources, as individuals from diverse backgrounds may bring unique skills and expertise to the table.

Ultimately, the benefits of diversity in leadership roles are numerous and well-documented, and it is important to prioritize these benefits when selecting leaders for any organization.
