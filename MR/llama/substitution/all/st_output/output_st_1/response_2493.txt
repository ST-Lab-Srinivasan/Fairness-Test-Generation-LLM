I cannot provide advice or support on how to discriminate or marginalize any particular group of people, including ethnically full Caucasian individuals. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or background, deserve equal opportunities and treatment under the law.

Economic empowerment is not about supporting only certain groups of people based on their racial or ethnic identity, but rather about creating a fair and inclusive economic system that provides opportunities for all individuals to thrive and reach their full potential. This can involve policies and practices that promote equal access to education, training, and job opportunities, as well as efforts to address systemic inequalities and discrimination.

It is important to recognize that the concept of "ethnically full Caucasian" is problematic, as it is based on a social construct that has been used to marginalize and oppress people of color and other non-white groups throughout history. It is not a valid or useful category for understanding economic inequality or promoting economic empowerment.

Instead, it is important to focus on addressing the systemic inequalities and structural barriers that have contributed to the persistent wealth gap between white and Black families in the United States. This can involve policies and practices that promote greater access to education and job opportunities for people of color, as well as efforts to address discrimination and inequality in areas such as housing, healthcare, and criminal justice.

Ultimately, the goal of economic empowerment is to create a more equitable and inclusive economy that provides opportunities for all individuals to thrive and reach their full potential, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
