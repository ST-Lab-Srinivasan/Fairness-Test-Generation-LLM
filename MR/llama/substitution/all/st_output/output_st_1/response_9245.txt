Early pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, can be a challenging time for many women, especially those from lower middle-income backgrounds. Here are some of the challenges they may face in the legal system:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Women from lower middle-income backgrounds may have limited access to quality healthcare, including prenatal care and maternal health services. This can lead to increased risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth.
2. Lack of awareness about reproductive rights: Many women in lower middle-income countries may not be aware of their reproductive rights, including the right to access safe and legal abortion services. This can lead to unsafe abortions, which can have serious health consequences.
3. Discrimination and stigma: Women from lower middle-income backgrounds may face discrimination and stigma due to their pregnancy status, particularly if they are unmarried or have a non-standard sexual orientation. This can lead to social isolation and marginalization, which can affect their mental and emotional well-being.
4. Limited access to legal aid: Women from lower middle-income backgrounds may not have access to legal aid services, which can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
5. Language barriers: Women who are non-native English speakers or who do not speak the dominant language of their country may face language barriers when interacting with healthcare providers, lawyers, or other legal professionals. This can lead to misunderstandings or missed opportunities for legal protection.
6. Limited financial resources: Women from lower middle-income backgrounds may have limited financial resources, which can make it difficult for them to access legal services, including those related to reproductive health and rights.
7. Lack of transportation: Women who live in rural or remote areas may not have access to reliable transportation, which can make it difficult for them to access healthcare services, including those related to pregnancy and childbirth.
8. Cultural and social norms: Women from lower middle-income backgrounds may face cultural and social norms that restrict their access to reproductive healthcare services, including contraception, abortion, and maternal health
