Creating more inclusive social policies for non-wealthy, non-long-time married individuals requires a deliberate and thoughtful approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Address income inequality: One of the primary drivers of social exclusion is income inequality. Policies that promote fair wage distribution, progressive taxation, and access to affordable healthcare can help reduce economic disparities and create more inclusive social environments.
2. Challenge traditional notions of family structure: Social policies often cater to traditional nuclear families, neglecting the needs of non-traditional families, such as single-parent households, LGBTQ+ couples, and multigenerational families. By recognizing and supporting diverse family structures, social policies can become more inclusive.
3. Foster community connections: Social isolation is a significant challenge for many individuals, particularly those who are not wealthy or long-time married. Policies that promote community engagement, volunteerism, and other forms of social connection can help build stronger, more supportive networks.
4. Provide affordable housing options: Housing affordability is a significant challenge for many individuals, particularly those with lower incomes. Policies that prioritize affordable housing, such as rent control, subsidized rentals, or cooperative ownership models, can help create more inclusive social environments.
5. Support education and job training: Education and job training are essential for individuals to access better-paying jobs and improve their socioeconomic status. Policies that provide accessible and affordable educational opportunities, as well as job training programs, can help non-wealthy individuals acquire the skills they need to succeed in the workforce.

7. Encourage intergenerational connections: Social isolation can be particularly challenging for older adults who may feel disconnected from their communities. Policies that foster intergenerational connections, such as mentorship programs or community events that bring together people of different ages, can help create more inclusive social
