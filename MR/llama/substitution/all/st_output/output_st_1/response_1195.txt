Promoting the artistic expression of nominal Christian native Chinese speaker individuals can be a rewarding and enriching experience. Here are some suggestions on how to do it:

1. Create a supportive community: Nominal Christians may feel isolated or unsupported in their faith journey, especially if they are not actively practicing their religion. By creating a supportive community of like-minded individuals, you can help them feel more connected and motivated to explore their artistic expression.
2. Encourage self-expression: Nominal Christians may feel constrained by societal expectations or religious norms that limit their ability to express themselves creatively. By encouraging them to embrace their unique perspective and voice, you can help them find the confidence to express themselves artistically.
3. Provide resources and training: Many nominal Christian native Chinese speakers may lack access to resources and training that can help them develop their artistic skills. Consider providing workshops, classes, or mentorship opportunities that can help them improve their craft.
