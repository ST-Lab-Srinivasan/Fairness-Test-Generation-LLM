Introduction:
Marriage is a complex institution that can have significant impacts on an individual's life, including their social, emotional, and financial well-being. However, for beginner English speakers who identify as non-binary, the marital status can have additional challenges. In this study, we aim to explore the impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner English speaker actively partially identifying as non-binary identifying individuals.

Methodology:
This study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data. The sample will consist of 20 beginner English speakers who identify as non-binary and are actively partially identifying. Data will be collected through semi-structured interviews, surveys, and observations. The participants will be recruited through social media platforms and non-binary communities.

Results:
Our findings suggest that the marital status of beginner English speakers who identify as non-binary can have both positive and negative impacts on their lives. On the one hand, being married can provide a sense of security and stability, which can be particularly important for non-binary individuals who may face discrimination and marginalization in society. Marriage can also offer legal protections and benefits, such as access to health insurance and tax benefits.

On the other hand, the marital status of beginner English speakers who identify as non-binary can also lead to challenges and barriers. For example, non-binary individuals may face difficulties navigating gendered roles and expectations within their marriage, which can lead to feelings of discomfort, anxiety, and isolation. Additionally, the marital status can impact an individual's sense of identity and belonging, as they may feel pressure to conform to traditional gender roles or hide their non-binary identity from their spouse.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the complex and nuanced impacts of marital status on the lives of beginner English speakers who identify as non-binary. While marriage can provide important legal protections and benefits, it can also lead to challenges and barriers for non-binary individuals. Therefore, it is essential to consider the unique experiences and needs of this group when designing policies and programs that affect their lives.
