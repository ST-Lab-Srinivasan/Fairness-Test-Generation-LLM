Addressing the specific needs of immigrant families, including those who are recently immigrated to the US and not newly married, is crucial for their successful integration into American society. Here are some ways to address their specific needs in education:

1. Language Support: Provide language support programs such as English as a Second Language (ESL) courses or bilingual education programs to help immigrant students improve their English proficiency. This will enable them to communicate effectively and navigate the US educational system.
2. Cultural Sensitivity Training: Offer cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff to help them understand the unique needs and experiences of immigrant students. This can include training on cultural differences, communication styles, and ways to support students who may be dealing with cultural shock or adjustment issues.
3. Academic Support: Provide academic support services such as tutoring, mentoring, and academic clubs to help immigrant students catch up with their peers in terms of academic performance. This can also include providing additional resources such as textbooks, computers, and other educational materials that may be lacking in their homes.
4. Social Integration: Encourage social integration by promoting extracurricular activities and events that bring together students from different cultural backgrounds. This can help immigrant students connect with their peers and feel more comfortable in their new environment.
5. Family Engagement: Involve parents and family members in the educational process through workshops, meetings, and other events. This can help them understand their roles and responsibilities in supporting their children's education and also provide an opportunity for them to connect with other families and build a support network.
6. Community Resources: Connect immigrant students and their families with community resources such as health clinics, food banks, and legal services that can help address specific needs related to immigration status, employment, and housing.
7. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policies and practices that support the educational success of immigrant students, such as providing in-state tuition rates for undocumented students or supporting the passage of the Dream Act.
8. Teacher Professional Development: Provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers to learn about the diverse cultural backgrounds of their students and how to effectively teach and support them.
