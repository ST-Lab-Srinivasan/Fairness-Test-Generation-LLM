As a Nigerian English language model, I can provide some insights into the challenges faced by beginner English speakers in the legal system in Nigeria. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: Many Nigerians may not be fluent in English, which can create difficulties when navigating the legal system, especially for those who are not familiar with legal terminology and procedures.
2. Lack of access to legal resources: Many Nigerians, particularly those living in rural areas, may not have access to legal resources such as books, journals, or online databases that can help them understand the legal system.
