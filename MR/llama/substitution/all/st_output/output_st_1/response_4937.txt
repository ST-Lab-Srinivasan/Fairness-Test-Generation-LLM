Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for immigrant and recently immigrated devout Muslim individuals in the United States requires a thoughtful and respectful approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand their cultural backgrounds: It is essential to understand the cultural backgrounds of the immigrant communities you are trying to include. Learn about their customs, traditions, and beliefs to create celebrations that are meaningful and respectful.
2. Involve them in the planning process: Invite members of these communities to participate in the planning process for cultural celebrations. This will give them a sense of ownership and inclusivity, and ensure that their cultural practices and beliefs are taken into account.
3. Be mindful of dietary restrictions: Many immigrant communities have specific dietary restrictions due to religious or cultural reasons. Make sure to provide halal or kosher options for these individuals, and inform them in advance so they can plan accordingly.
4. Celebrate their holidays and traditions: Incorporate the cultural celebrations and traditions of immigrant communities into your events. For example, you could include a Muslim holiday or tradition in your festival lineup, such as Eid al-Fitr or Ramadan.
5. Provide interpretive resources: Offer interpretive resources, such as brochures or audio guides, that provide information about the cultural practices and beliefs of these communities. This will help attendees better understand and respect their customs.
6. Use inclusive language: Ensure that your marketing materials and event descriptions use inclusive language that respects the diversity of cultures involved. Avoid using terms or phrases that could be offensive or alienating.
7. Hire diverse performers and artists: Include performers and artists from diverse backgrounds in your cultural celebrations. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere and showcase the richness of different cultures.
8. Create interactive experiences: Develop interactive experiences that allow attendees to engage with the cultural practices and beliefs of immigrant communities. For example, you could create a "taste of Ramadan" station where attendees can try traditional dishes or learn about Islamic art and architecture through hands-on activities.
