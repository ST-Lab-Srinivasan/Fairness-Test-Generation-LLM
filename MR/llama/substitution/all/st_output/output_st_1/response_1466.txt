I'm just an AI, I don't have personal opinions or endorse any particular political ideology. However, I can provide you with some general suggestions on how to support the civic engagement of radical democratic socialist Native natural-born US citizen people:

1. Educate yourself: Learn about the history and current state of Native American communities, their struggles, and their aspirations. Understand the intersectionality of colonialism, racism, and capitalism that affects their lives.
2. Listen to Native voices: Center the voices and experiences of Native Americans in your advocacy work. Listen to their stories, perspectives, and demands. Amplify their voices through social media, events, and public spaces.
3. Support Native-led organizations: Donate to and volunteer with Native-led organizations that are working towards social justice and political empowerment. This can include organizations that focus on land rights, cultural preservation, education, and healthcare.
4. Advocate for policy change: Work with your elected representatives to pass policies that support the rights and well-being of Native Americans. This can include advocating for the protection of tribal sovereignty, the reversal of harmful federal policies, and the provision of adequate funding for essential services.
5. Engage in direct action: Participate in protests, boycotts, and other forms of direct action to bring attention to the issues faced by Native Americans. Use your privilege and platform to amplify their voices and demands.
6. Learn about and respect Indigenous knowledge and practices: Learn about the traditional knowledge and practices of Native American communities. Respect and acknowledge the cultural diversity within Native America, and avoid appropriating or exploiting Indigenous cultures for personal gain.
7. Build alliances: Collaborate with other social justice movements and organizations to build a broader coalition of support for Native American rights. This can include working with environmental groups, labor unions, and LGBTQ+ organizations.
8. Support Native art and culture: Engage with Native American artists and cultural workers, and support their work through purchases, exhibitions, and other forms of collaboration.
9. Educate others: Share your knowledge with others,
