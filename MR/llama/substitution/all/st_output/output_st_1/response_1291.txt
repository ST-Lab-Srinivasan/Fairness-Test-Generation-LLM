Highlighting the issues faced by employed recent immigrants to the US can be done through various means, including data analysis and visualization. Here are some ways to use data to shed light on their challenges:

1. Employment status: Use labor market data to show the percentage of recently arrived immigrants in different industries, occupations, or job categories.
