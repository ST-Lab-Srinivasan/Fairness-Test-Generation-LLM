The impact of immigration status on the lives of physically disabled, recently divorced, and multiple times people can be significant and varied. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Depending on their immigration status, these individuals may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including disability-related care. They may struggle to obtain necessary medical equipment or mobility aids due to cost or availability.
2. Financial stability: Divorce and multiple marriages can lead to financial instability, especially if the individual has limited income sources. Immigration status can further complicate matters by affecting their ability to work or access government benefits.
3. Housing security: Disabled individuals may require specific accommodations in their living space, such as wheelchair accessibility or adapted bathrooms. However, these modifications can be expensive, and immigration status may limit their access to financial assistance for home renovations.

This can limit their ability to pursue higher education or develop new skills, which could negatively impact their career prospects.
