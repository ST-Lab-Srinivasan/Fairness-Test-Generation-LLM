As a mixed Asian heritage person learning Chinese, you may face several challenges when interacting with the legal system in China. Here are some of the common challenges that you may encounter:

1. Language barrier: Chinese is a complex and nuanced language that can be difficult for native English speakers to learn, let alone for those who have mixed Asian heritage. The legal terminology and procedures in China can be especially challenging due to the use of colloquial expressions and cultural references that may not be familiar to non-native speakers.
2. Cultural differences: As a mixed Asian heritage person, you may face cultural differences when interacting with the legal system in China. For example, the concept of "guanxi" (relationships) is highly valued in Chinese culture, which can affect how legal proceedings are conducted and resolved.

This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications during legal proceedings that could affect the outcome of your case.
