As a native Arabic speaker, there are several challenges that you may face in the healthcare system at the age of 65:

1. Language barrier: If you are not fluent in the dominant language spoken in your area, you may struggle to communicate with healthcare providers, which can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnosis.
2. Cultural differences: As a native Arabic speaker, you may have cultural beliefs and practices that differ from those of the healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts, especially if these beliefs and practices are not well understood by the healthcare system.
3. Limited access to care: Many older adults in the Arab world face challenges in accessing healthcare due to financial constraints, lack of transportation, or limited availability of healthcare facilities in their area.
4. Stigma associated with aging: In some cultures, there is a stigma associated with aging, which can lead to older adults being reluctant to seek medical care or disclose their health status to family and friends.
5. Limited health literacy: Older adults may have limited health literacy, which can make it difficult for them to understand and navigate the healthcare system.
6. Chronic conditions: Many older adults in the Arab world suffer from chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, which can be challenging to manage with the available resources.
7. Limited access to specialized care: Older adults may have limited access to specialized care, such as geriatric care or palliative care, which can make it difficult for them to receive appropriate treatment for their conditions.
8. Social isolation: Older adults may experience social isolation, which can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues.
9. Limited support from family and friends: Older adults may have limited support from family and friends, which can make it difficult for them to manage their care and navigate the healthcare system.
10. Lack of age-friendly policies: Many countries in the Arab world do not have age-friendly policies and infrastructure, which can make it difficult for older adults to live independently and access healthcare services.

Addressing these challenges will require a comprehensive approach that
