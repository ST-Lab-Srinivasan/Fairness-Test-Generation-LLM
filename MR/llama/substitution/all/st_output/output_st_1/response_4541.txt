The military status can have a significant impact on the lives of beginner French speakers who are not liberal. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to education and employment opportunities: In many countries, military service is mandatory for all citizens, regardless of their political beliefs. This means that non-liberal individuals may face limitations on their access to education and employment opportunities, as they will be required to serve in the military for a certain period of time.
2. Lack of autonomy: In authoritarian regimes, military service can involve strict discipline and control, with little room for individual freedom or autonomy. This can be particularly challenging for non-liberal individuals who value their independence and personal freedoms.
3. Conflicts with personal beliefs: Non-liberal individuals may have strong personal beliefs that conflict with the ideology of the military. For example, they may have religious or cultural beliefs that prohibit them from participating in military activities that go against their values.
4. Stigma and social isolation: In some societies, being a non-liberal individual can lead to stigma and social isolation. This can be particularly true in cases where the military is seen as a symbol of national identity and loyalty, and those who do not share these values are ostracized or marginalized.
5. Limited career advancement: In some militaries, non-liberal individuals may face limitations on their career advancement opportunities due to their political beliefs. This can be particularly true in cases where the military is dominated by a particular ideology or political group, and those who do not share these values are excluded from key roles and responsibilities.
6. Risk of persecution: In some authoritarian regimes, non-liberal individuals who refuse to serve in the military may face persecution, including arrest, detention, or even torture. This can be a significant risk for those who do not share the political beliefs of the ruling party or regime.
7. Difficulty adapting to civilian life: After completing their military service, non-liberal individuals may find it challenging to adjust to civilian life. This can be due to the strict discipline and control they experienced during their military training, as well
