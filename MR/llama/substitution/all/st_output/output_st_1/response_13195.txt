1. Lack of legal recognition: In many jurisdictions, there is no explicit legal recognition of post-transition individuals, which can lead to difficulties in accessing rights and benefits.
2. Identity documents: Post-transition individuals may face challenges when obtaining identity documents such as passports, driver's licenses, and other forms of identification that accurately reflect their gender identity.
3. Healthcare discrimination: Transgender individuals may experience discrimination in healthcare settings, including difficulties accessing gender-affirming care and facing resistance from healthcare providers who are not knowledgeable about transgender issues.
4. Employment discrimination: Post-transition individuals may face discrimination in the workplace, including harassment, unequal pay, and difficulty advancing in their careers due to their gender identity.
5. Housing discrimination: Transgender individuals may experience discrimination when seeking housing, including difficulties finding affordable and safe housing that aligns with their gender identity.
6. Family law issues: Post-transition individuals may face challenges when it comes to family law issues such as divorce, child custody, and inheritance, as their gender identity may not be recognized in legal documents.
7. Criminal justice system: Transgender individuals may experience discrimination within the criminal justice system, including difficulties accessing appropriate healthcare while incarcerated and facing harassment or violence from other inmates.
8. Immigration issues: Post-transition individuals who are non-citizens may face additional challenges when it comes to immigration issues, including difficulties obtaining legal status and facing discrimination based on their gender identity.
9. Education: Transgender students may face discrimination in educational settings, including difficulties accessing appropriate accommodations and facing harassment from peers and educators.
