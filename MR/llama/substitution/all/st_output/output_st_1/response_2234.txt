It is important to recognize that ensuring the healthcare needs of any particular group, including native English speakers from a middle class background, requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help ensure the healthcare needs of this population are met:

1. Increase access to care: Middle-class individuals may have better access to healthcare resources due to their socioeconomic status, but there are still gaps in care that need to be addressed. Increasing access to primary care services, specialist care, and mental health services can help ensure that everyone's needs are met.
