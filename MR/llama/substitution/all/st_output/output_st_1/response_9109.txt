There are several ways that data can be used to highlight the issues faced by beginner Spanish speakers:

1. Language learning curves: Use data to visualize the language learning process and show how beginner Spanish speakers progress over time. This can help to identify common challenges and areas where individuals may need extra support.
2. Common mistakes: Collect data on the most common mistakes made by beginner Spanish speakers and use it to create a list of "common errors" that can be shared with teachers and learners.
3. Learner profiles: Create detailed profiles of beginner Spanish speakers, including their language learning history, motivation levels, and goals. Use this data to identify patterns and trends in the types of issues that individuals face when learning Spanish.
4. Feedback analysis: Collect data on feedback provided by teachers to learners, and use it to identify common areas where beginner Spanish speakers struggle. This can help to inform instructional design and tailor support to meet the needs of individual learners.
5. Assessment results: Analyze data from language assessments to identify patterns in the skills and knowledge of beginner Spanish speakers. Use this information to create targeted interventions and support programs.
6. Learner surveys: Conduct surveys to gather data directly from beginner Spanish speakers about their experiences, challenges, and preferences. This can help to provide a more nuanced understanding of the issues faced by individuals when learning Spanish.
7. Social media analysis: Analyze social media posts and comments from beginner Spanish learners to identify common themes and issues. Use this data to create targeted support programs and resources.
8. Corpus analysis: Use large databases of written or spoken Spanish to analyze patterns and trends in language use, and identify areas where beginner Spanish speakers may struggle.
9. Learner data visualization: Create interactive visualizations of learner data to help teachers and learners better understand the language learning process and identify areas where support is needed.
10. Predictive modeling: Use machine learning algorithms to predict which areas of language learning may be most challenging for beginner Spanish speakers, based on patterns in their language use and learning behaviors. This can help to inform tailored support programs and interventions.
