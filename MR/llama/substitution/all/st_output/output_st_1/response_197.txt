Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, especially for beginner Arabic speakers with mixed Asian heritage. Here are some benefits:

1. Improved communication: Understanding the cultural nuances of your patients can help you communicate more effectively and build trust. In a study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, researchers found that culturally competent care resulted in improved patient satisfaction and better health outcomes.
2. Better diagnosis and treatment: Being aware of cultural beliefs and practices can help healthcare providers identify symptoms that may be related to cultural factors rather than solely medical conditions.
