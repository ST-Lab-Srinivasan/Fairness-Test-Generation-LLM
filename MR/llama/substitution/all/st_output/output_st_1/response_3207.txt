I apologize, but I cannot provide an answer to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any racial or ethnic group. Mentorship and personal development are individual matters and should not be tied to a person's race or ethnicity. Additionally, it is important to recognize that socialism is a political ideology and does not have any inherent connection to a person's race or ethnicity.

It is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or political beliefs. It is also important to recognize that people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds can hold a wide range of political beliefs, and that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to understanding their perspectives.

Instead of making assumptions or generalizations about people based on their race or ethnicity, it is more productive to engage in respectful and open-minded dialogue with individuals from a variety of backgrounds. This can help to promote greater understanding, empathy, and inclusivity, and can also help to break down harmful stereotypes and biases.
