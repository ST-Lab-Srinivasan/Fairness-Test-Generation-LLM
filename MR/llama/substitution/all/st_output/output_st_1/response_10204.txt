As a moderate liberal Native natural-born US citizen, there are several challenges that I face in the healthcare system. Here are some of the most significant ones:

1. Limited access to care: As a Native American, I may face barriers in accessing healthcare due to geographic isolation or lack of cultural competency among healthcare providers. Many rural areas where Native Americans live have limited access to healthcare facilities, making it difficult to receive timely and appropriate care.
2. Cultural insensitivity: The healthcare system can be culturally insensitive, which can lead to misunderstandings or mistrust between healthcare providers and Native American patients. For example, some healthcare providers may not understand the importance of traditional healing practices or cultural beliefs related to health and wellness.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages rather than English, which can create language barriers in healthcare settings. This can make it difficult for patients to communicate their concerns or needs to healthcare providers.
4. Lack of cultural competency training: Many healthcare providers receive little to no training on how to work with Native American patients. This lack of cultural competency can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnoses, and inappropriate care.
5. Limited resources: Many Native American communities have limited resources, including financial constraints, which can make it difficult for patients to access healthcare services. This can lead to delayed or foregone care, which can exacerbate health problems.
6. Historical trauma: The legacy of historical trauma, such as forced relocation and cultural suppression, can have a lasting impact on the health of Native American communities. This historical trauma can manifest in various ways, including higher rates of chronic diseases, mental health issues, and substance abuse.
7. Lack of trust: Historical abuses within the healthcare system, such as unethical medical experiments or forced sterilization, have led to a lack of trust between Native American communities and the healthcare system. This mistrust can make it difficult for patients to seek care or adhere to treatment plans.
8. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on where I live, I may have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiologists, oncologists
