Addressing the needs of non-citizen individuals, particularly those in their first trimester of pregnancy, during a disaster response requires a comprehensive approach that takes into account their unique circumstances and vulnerabilities. Here are some key considerations for addressing their needs:

1. Access to healthcare: Ensure that non-citizen individuals have access to adequate prenatal care, including medical check-ups, labor and delivery services, and postpartum care. This may involve partnering with local healthcare providers or setting up temporary clinics in disaster-affected areas.
2. Language barriers: Provide interpreters or translators to help non-citizen individuals communicate effectively with medical professionals and emergency responders. This can help alleviate stress and ensure that their needs are being met.
3. Cultural sensitivity: Be sensitive to the cultural practices and beliefs of non-citizen individuals, particularly those related to pregnancy and childbirth. For example, some cultures may have specific beliefs about what foods are safe during pregnancy or how they should be delivered.
4. Access to food and water: Ensure that non-citizen individuals have access to clean drinking water and nutritious food, which can be especially important during pregnancy. This may involve distributing emergency supplies such as bottled water, non-perishable food items, and diapers.
5. Shelter and temporary housing: Provide temporary shelter and housing for non-citizen individuals who have been displaced from their homes due to the disaster. This can include setting up emergency shelters or connecting them with local organizations that provide temporary housing.
6. Legal support: Offer legal support to non-citizen individuals who may be experiencing difficulties related to their immigration status during the disaster response. This can include providing information on available legal resources, such as immigration attorneys or legal aid organizations.
7. Community engagement: Engage with local communities and organizations that serve non-citizen individuals to ensure that their needs are being met and that they are receiving appropriate support. This can involve partnering with community groups, religious organizations, or other social service providers.
8. Advocacy: Advocate for the rights and well-being of non-citizen individuals
