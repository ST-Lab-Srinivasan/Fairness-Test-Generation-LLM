Introduction:
Marriage is a significant life event that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. In the context of Arabic speakers, marriage can be especially challenging due to cultural and societal expectations. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker masculine individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that marriage can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's life. On one hand, marriage can provide emotional support, financial stability, and social recognition. On the other hand, it can also lead to increased responsibilities, stress, and feelings of isolation (Wu & Li, 2018).

In the context of Arabic speakers, marriage can be particularly challenging due to cultural and societal expectations. For example, in many Arab cultures, men are expected to be the breadwinners and providers, while women are expected to take on a more submissive role (Hamoudi, 2017). This can lead to increased pressure on men to perform well in their roles as husbands and fathers, and can also limit their ability to express themselves emotionally.

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews with beginner Arabic speaker masculine individuals. Participants will be recruited through online advertisements and social media platforms, and will be selected based on their proficiency in Arabic and their interest in discussing the impact of marital status on their lives.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from the interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis, a method that allows for an in-depth examination of the themes and patterns that emerge from the data (Braun & Clarke, 2013). The findings will be organized into categories and subcategories, and will be presented in a narrative format.

Expected Findings:
Based on the literature review and methodology described above, we expect to find several themes related to the impact of marital status on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker masculine individuals. These may include:

1. Increased responsibilities and stress: Men may report feeling increased pressure to provide for their families and meet societal expect
