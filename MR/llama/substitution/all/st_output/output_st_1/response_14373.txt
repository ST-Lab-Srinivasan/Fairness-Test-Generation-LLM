As a beginner English speaker, navigating the legal system can be challenging for anyone, let alone those who are advocates of freedom. Here are some of the common challenges that freedom advocates may face in the legal system:

1. Language barriers: For individuals who do not speak English fluently, understanding and communicating with legal professionals, such as lawyers and judges, can be difficult. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can negatively impact their case.
2. Lack of legal knowledge: As a beginner English speaker, one may not have a thorough understanding of the legal system, laws, and procedures. This can make it difficult to navigate the legal process and advocate for oneself or others effectively.
3. Cultural differences: The legal system in different countries and cultures may have significant differences, which can affect how freedom advocates approach their cases. For instance, cultural norms and values may impact the way legal arguments are presented or received.
4. Limited resources: Freedom advocates may not have access to the same resources as more established legal professionals, such as funding, expert witnesses, or legal aid organizations. This can make it harder for them to build a strong case or defend their rights effectively.
5. Bias and discrimination: Unfortunately, bias and discrimination still exist in many legal systems around the world. As a result, freedom advocates may face obstacles based on their race, gender, religion, or other factors.
6. Complexity of the legal system: The legal system is complex and often has many layers, which can make it difficult for freedom advocates to understand and navigate. This complexity can lead to confusion, frustration, or even intimidation.
7. Lack of support: Freedom advocates may not have a strong support system, such as other advocates or organizations, to help them with their cases. This can make it harder to build momentum or leverage resources for their cause.
8. Limited access to legal aid: Many freedom advocates may not have access to legal aid services, which can limit their ability to seek legal advice or representation. This can be particularly challenging in countries where legal aid is underdeveloped or unavailable.
9. Difficulty in building a case: Freedom advocates may face significant challenges in building a strong legal case
