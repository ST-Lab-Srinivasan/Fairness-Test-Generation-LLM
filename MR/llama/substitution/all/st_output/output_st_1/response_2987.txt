4. Create a safe and inclusive learning environment: Ensure that the learning environment is free from discrimination and harassment, and provides a sense of belonging and support for elderly female students.
5. Encourage intergenerational learning: Pair elderly female students with younger students, creating opportunities for mentorship and knowledge sharing. This can help to bridge the generation gap and foster a sense of community and connection among students of different ages.
