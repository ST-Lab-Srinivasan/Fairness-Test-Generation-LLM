Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Native and Recent Immigrant Extreme Ultra-Liberals in the US

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of individuals, particularly those from diverse backgrounds. In the context of the US, the identities of Native recent immigrants and extreme ultra-liberals are influenced by their cultural heritage. This paper examines the role of cultural heritage in shaping these identities, focusing on the experiences of Native recent immigrants and extreme ultra-liberals.

Identity formation is a complex process that involves the intersection of multiple factors, including cultural heritage, personal experiences, and social context. Cultural identity refers to the ways in which individuals define themselves in relation to their cultural background, while critical race theory highlights the role of power dynamics in shaping individual and collective identities.

Participants were purposefully selected to ensure diversity in terms of race, ethnicity, and political beliefs. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed for themes related to cultural heritage and identity formation.

Findings:
Three main themes emerged from the data analysis: (1) Cultural preservation and resistance, (2) Intersectional identities, and (3) Politicized culture.

Intersectional identities: The participants' experiences of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and other aspects of their identity intersect and inform their cultural heritage. They navigate complex power dynamics, challeng
