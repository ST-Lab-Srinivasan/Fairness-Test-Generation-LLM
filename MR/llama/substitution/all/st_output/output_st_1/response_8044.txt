This can involve organizing workshops or campaigns that raise awareness about the importance of accessibility and inclusion for all individuals, regardless of their religious beliefs.
7. Partnerships: Collaborating with organizations that cater to the needs of devout Muslim individuals can help identify specific challenges and develop solutions that are tailored to these needs. This can involve partnering with community centers or religious organizations to provide support and resources for
