Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed African-American non-conservative individuals. For these individuals, their cultural heritage is a complex mix of African, African American, and other cultural influences that have contributed to their sense of self and identity.

For example, they may reject the idea that they are "too black" or "not black enough," or that they are "too American" or "not American enough."
