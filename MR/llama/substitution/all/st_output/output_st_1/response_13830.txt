Ensuring the legal rights of long-term, undocumented individuals with unknown or untested genetic conditions is a complex issue. Here are some potential strategies to protect their legal rights:

1. Advocacy and Awareness: Organizations that advocate for the rights of marginalized communities can play a crucial role in raising awareness about the legal rights of undocumented individuals with genetic conditions. This includes educating lawmakers, healthcare providers, and the general public about the challenges faced by these individuals and the need for legal protections.
