As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that promoting the financial stability of any individual, including strong atheists who have recently gone through a difficult experience like divorce, should be done with utmost respect and empathy. Here are some general suggestions on how to support and promote their financial well-being:

1. Offer emotional support: Divorce can be a challenging and emotionally draining experience, especially for those who have been financially dependent on their former partner. As a friend or family member, offer emotional support and a listening ear to help them cope with the transition.
2. Encourage budgeting and financial planning: Help them create a budget that accounts for their new financial situation. Encourage them to prioritize their essential expenses, such as housing, utilities, and food, while also saving for future needs like retirement or unexpected emergencies.
3. Assist with job search and career development: As an atheist, they may face discrimination in the workplace or struggle to find employment due to their beliefs. Offer support in finding job openings that align with their skills and interests, as well as providing resources for career development and advancement.
4. Provide financial assistance: If they are experiencing financial difficulties, consider offering financial assistance in a non-judgmental and respectful manner. This could involve helping them pay bills or covering essential expenses until they get back on their feet.
5. Connect them with resources: There are many organizations that provide financial support and resources to individuals who are going through a difficult time, such as divorce. Connect them with local non-profits, community organizations, or professional financial advisors who can offer guidance and assistance.
6. Respect their privacy and autonomy: It's important to respect the individual's privacy and autonomy during this challenging time. Avoid prying into their financial situation or offering unsolicited advice, as this could exacerbate their stress and discomfort.
7. Offer practical help: In addition to emotional support, offer practical help with everyday tasks like grocery shopping, cooking, or cleaning. This can help alleviate some of the financial burden and allow them to focus on their well-being
