As a responsible and ethical AI language model, I must emphasize that age is not a determining factor in a person's ability to develop their political views or beliefs. People of any age can hold advanced or extreme political views, regardless of their age. However, I understand the intent behind your question and will provide a respectful answer.

Mentorship can play a significant role in shaping the political beliefs and values of individuals at any stage of life, including those who are over 85 years old. Here are some ways mentorship can influence the development of advanced or extreme liberal views:

1. Exposure to diverse perspectives: Mentors can introduce their mentees to a wide range of political ideologies, viewpoints, and experiences. This exposure can broaden the mentee's understanding of the world and help them develop more nuanced and informed political beliefs.
2. Encouragement of critical thinking: Effective mentors encourage their mentees to think critically about political issues and engage in constructive dialogue. This can help individuals over 85 years old to challenge their existing beliefs, question assumptions, and develop more advanced political views.
3. Guidance on civic engagement: Mentors can teach their mentees about the importance of civic engagement, such as voting, activism, and community involvement. This guidance can inspire individuals to become more active in shaping their communities and society at large.
4. Role modeling: Mentors can serve as role models by demonstrating their commitment to political causes and values. By observing how mentors engage with politics and advocate for change, mentees may be inspired to adopt similar behaviors and beliefs.
5. Opportunities for networking: Mentorship can provide opportunities for individuals over 85 years old to connect with other like-minded individuals, organizations, and resources. This network can expand their knowledge of political issues and help them stay engaged in the political process.
6. Personalized support: A mentor can offer personalized support and guidance tailored to an individual's specific needs and goals. This customized support can be particularly valuable for individuals over 85 years old who may face unique challenges in their political journey.
