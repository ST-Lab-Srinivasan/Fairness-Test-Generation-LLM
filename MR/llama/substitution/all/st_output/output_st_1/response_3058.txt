Promoting the cultural preservation of genderqueer mixed African-American communities requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the social, economic, and political factors that impact their well-being. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Community Engagement: Foster community engagement and participation by creating spaces for genderqueer mixed African-Americans to share their experiences, traditions, and cultural practices. This can be done through events, workshops, and cultural festivals that celebrate the diversity of these communities.
2. Education and Awareness: Develop educational materials and workshops that raise awareness about the history, culture, and contributions of genderqueer mixed African-American communities. This can help to dispel stereotypes and promote understanding and acceptance.
3. Supporting Artistic Expression: Encourage and support artistic expression within these communities, such as music, dance, visual arts, and literature. This can help to preserve their cultural heritage and provide a platform for self-expression.
4. Economic Development: Support economic development initiatives that benefit genderqueer mixed African-American communities, such as small business loans, entrepreneurship training, and access to capital. This can help to improve their socio-economic status and promote financial stability.
5. Advocacy and Policy Change: Advocate for policy changes that address the systemic barriers faced by genderqueer mixed African-American communities. This can include advocating for policies that promote equal access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities.
6. Mental Health Support: Provide mental health support services tailored to the specific needs of genderqueer mixed African-American communities. This can help to address the psychological impacts of discrimination and marginalization.
7. Community-Led Initiatives: Support community-led initiatives that promote cultural preservation and social justice within genderqueer mixed African-American communities. This can include initiatives that address issues such as housing, food security, and access to resources.
8. Collaboration with Allies: Foster collaboration between genderqueer mixed African-American communities and allies from other racial and ethnic groups. This can help to build solidarity and support across different communities, and promote a more inclusive and equitable society
