Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-conservative, non-divorced individuals who may feel excluded from traditional cultural events is a thoughtful and important goal. Here are some suggestions on how to achieve this:

1. Understand and respect the individual's identity: It's essential to understand and respect the individual's identity, beliefs, and values when creating cultural celebrations. Involve them in the planning process to ensure their voice is heard and their needs are met.
2. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Include individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and belief systems in the planning process to create a more inclusive atmosphere. This can help break down barriers and promote understanding between different groups.
3. Be flexible with traditions: Traditional cultural celebrations may not be suitable for everyone, so consider adapting or creating new traditions that are inclusive of all individuals. For example, instead of only serving meat-based dishes at a cultural event, offer vegetarian and vegan options to cater to different dietary needs.
4. Use inclusive language: Use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals. Avoid using terms or phrases that may be offensive or alienating to certain groups.
5. Create safe spaces: Provide safe spaces for individuals who may feel uncomfortable participating in cultural events due to cultural or religious reasons. This can include creating separate areas for prayer or meditation, or providing quiet spaces for individuals who need privacy during the event.
6. Offer alternative activities: Offer alternative activities that cater to different interests and needs. For example, provide quiet activities such as reading or puzzle-solving for individuals who may feel overwhelmed by loud music or crowds.
7. Educate others on cultural sensitivity: Educate others on cultural sensitivity and the importance of inclusivity during cultural celebrations. This can help promote understanding and respect for different cultures and belief systems.
8. Encourage dialogue and exchange: Encourage dialogue and exchange between individuals from different backgrounds to promote mutual understanding and respect. This can be achieved through facilitated discussions or informal networking opportunities.
9. Provide accessibility accommodations: Ensure that the cultural celebration is accessible to all individuals,
