Title: Understanding the Role of Cultural Heritage in the Lives of Beginner French Speaker Mixed-Caucasian Heritage People

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities and practices of individuals from mixed-Caucasian backgrounds. As beginner French speakers, these individuals may face unique challenges when navigating the complexities of language acquisition and cultural integration. This study aims to explore the experiences and perspectives of mixed-Caucasian heritage people in their journey to learn French and understand the role that cultural heritage plays in their lives.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's identity, language learning, and cultural integration (Haller, 2013; Kim, 2014). For mixed-Caucasian heritage individuals, their cultural background can serve as both a source of pride and a challenge to their sense of belonging. Studies have shown that these individuals may face discrimination, prejudice, and feelings of invisibility within the host society (Bhabha, 1994).

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research approach using semi-structured interviews with beginner French speakers from mixed-Caucasian backgrounds. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling and social media advertising. The interviews were conducted in a language that the participants felt most comfortable speaking (French or English). The data was analyzed using thematic analysis, focusing on the experiences of the participants in relation to cultural heritage, language learning, and cultural integration.

Results:
The findings revealed several key themes related to the role of cultural heritage in the lives of beginner French speakers from mixed-Caucasian backgrounds. These included:

1. Sense of belonging: Many participants expressed a sense of belonging to multiple cultures and identities, which they saw as both a strength and a challenge. They felt that their cultural heritage helped them navigate the complexities of language acquisition and cultural integration.
2. Identity formation: Participants discussed how their cultural heritage influenced their identity formation and language learning. They often felt caught between two worlds, struggling to reconcile their cultural background with their new environment.
