2. Provide authentic materials: Utilize authentic Chinese materials, such as news articles, videos, and podcasts, to expose learners to real-life language use. This can help learners develop a more nuanced understanding of the language and its cultural context.

10. Provide feedback and support: Offering constructive feedback and support can help learn
