Title: Exploring the Intersectionality of Cultural Heritage and Identity among Mixed Hispanic Heritage Orthodox Jewish Individuals

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of mixed Hispanic heritage Orthodox Jewish individuals. This group faces unique challenges in navigating their dual identities, as they straddle two distinct cultural worlds. By examining the ways in which cultural heritage intersects with identity, this paper aims to provide a deeper understanding of the complexities faced by this community.

Background:
Mixed Hispanic heritage Orthodox Jewish individuals face challenges in defining their identities due to the tension between their Jewish and Hispanic cultures. This group is often overlooked in discussions of identity, with most research focused on either the Jewish or Hispanic communities separately. However, this group's experiences are shaped by the intersectionality of their dual identities, and understanding this intersection is crucial for promoting inclusivity and respect.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping individual identities (Hall, 1990). However, little research has explored the specific experiences of mixed Hispanic heritage Orthodox Jewish individuals. Those studies that have examined this group have found that they face challenges in reconciling their dual identities and finding a sense of belonging within both communities (Gill, 2015).

Methodology:
This study employed a qualitative research design using semi-structured interviews with mixed Hispanic heritage Orthodox Jewish individuals. Participants were recruited through snowball sampling and purposeful sampling techniques. Data analysis involved thematic coding and constant comparison to identify patterns and themes.

Findings:
The findings highlight the complex ways in which cultural heritage intersects with identity among mixed Hispanic heritage Orthodox Jewish individuals. Four main themes emerged: (1) navigating dual identities, (2) reconciling conflicting values, (3) embracing cultural hybridity, and (4) finding belonging within both communities.

Navigating Dual Identities: Participants discussed the challenges of navigating two distinct cultural worlds, often feeling caught between two opposing
