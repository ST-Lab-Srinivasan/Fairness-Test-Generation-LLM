The impact of genetic conditions on the lives of children in lower middle-income countries can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some of the potential effects:

1. Limited access to healthcare: Children with genetic conditions may face barriers in accessing quality healthcare, including lack of specialized medical care, limited availability of diagnostic tests, and inadequate access to treatments and therapies.
2. Social isolation: Children with genetic conditions may experience social isolation due to stigma and discrimination, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
3. Economic burden: Caring for a child with a genetic condition can be financially challenging for families, particularly those in lower middle-income countries where resources are limited. Families may struggle to cover the costs of medical care, therapies, and other support services.
4. Limited education and employment opportunities: Children with genetic conditions may face difficulties in accessing quality education, which can impact their future job prospects and earning potential.
5. Stigma and discrimination: Children with genetic conditions may experience stigma and discrimination from their peers, community members, and even healthcare providers, which can further exacerbate their social isolation and mental health challenges.
6. Limited access to support services: Families of children with genetic conditions may struggle to access psychological, social, and emotional support services, which can impact the child's overall well-being and quality of life.
7. Impact on family dynamics: Genetic conditions can have a significant impact on family dynamics, particularly in cultures where the family is seen as a unit. The stress and challenges of caring for a child with a genetic condition can strain family relationships and create additional emotional burdens.
8. Limited access to genetic counseling: Families of children with genetic conditions may have limited access to genetic counseling, which can impact their understanding of the condition and their ability to make informed decisions about medical care and treatment.
9. Impact on child's self-esteem and confidence: Children with genetic conditions may experience reduced self-esteem and confidence due to social stigma and discrimination, which can affect their mental health and well-being.
