Accessing mental health services specifically tailored to their experiences can help them manage these issues and improve their overall well-being.
4. Educational resources: Developing a strong educational foundation can be particularly important for mixed Hispanic heritage individuals, who may face barriers related to language proficiency or cultural differences in academic settings.
