Creating more inclusive cultural programs for agnostic recent immigrants to the US involves understanding their unique needs and preferences, and tailoring cultural activities that cater to their diverse backgrounds and beliefs. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse cultural elements: When designing cultural programs, consider incorporating elements from various cultures to accommodate the diversity of recent immigrants. For instance, you could include traditional music, dance, or art from different parts of the world in your programs.
2. Be sensitive to religious differences: Recognize that not everyone may identify with a particular religion, and design programs accordingly. Avoid requiring participants to participate in religious activities that go against their beliefs or practices.
3. Offer optional cultural components: Provide options for cultural activities that cater to different preferences and beliefs. For example, offer both religious and non-religious cultural events, such as a Christmas party for those who celebrate the holiday and a winter solstice celebration for those who do not.
4. Encourage dialogue and mutual understanding: Organize events that foster intercultural dialogue and understanding. Pair recent immigrants with long-term residents to encourage cross-cultural exchange and promote mutual respect.
5. Provide language support: Offer language classes or interpreters for cultural events to ensure that everyone can participate comfortably, regardless of their language proficiency.
6. Create a diverse planning committee: Assemble a team of people from various backgrounds to plan and execute cultural programs. This will help ensure that the needs and perspectives of all recent immigrants are taken into account.
7. Engage with local community groups: Collaborate with local organizations that cater to agnostic recent immigrants, such as language schools or community centers. They can provide valuable insights and resources for creating more inclusive cultural programs.
8. Offer flexible participation options: Allow participants to choose how they want to engage in cultural activities, whether it's attending events in person or participating online. This will accommodate individuals with varying levels of mobility or access to technology.
9. Provide education and resources: Offer workshops or classes that teach about different cultures, traditions, and customs. This
