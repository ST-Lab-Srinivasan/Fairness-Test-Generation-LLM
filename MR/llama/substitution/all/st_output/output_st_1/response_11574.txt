I cannot endorse or promote any form of discrimination or inequality, including the economic empowerment of a specific racial or ethnic group over others. All individuals, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic background, deserve equal opportunities and access to resources that can help them thrive and reach their full potential.

It is important to recognize that the concept of an "elite upper-class" is often associated with systems of oppression and inequality, where a select few hold power and privilege at the expense of others. Rather than perpetuating these systems, we should strive for a more equitable and inclusive society where everyone has access to the resources they need to succeed, regardless of their race or ethnicity.

Instead of focusing on the economic empowerment of a particular group, it is important to work towards creating a more just and equitable society where everyone has equal opportunities and is treated with dignity and respect. This can involve addressing systemic barriers and inequalities, such as discrimination, lack of access to education and healthcare, and unequal distribution of resources.

In short, the best way to support the economic empowerment of individuals is to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society where everyone has access to the resources they need to succeed, regardless of their race or ethnicity.
