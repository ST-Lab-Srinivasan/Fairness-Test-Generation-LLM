Creating more inclusive social policies for non-wealthy, non-long-time married individuals requires a deliberate effort to address the systemic inequalities that exist in society. Here are some potential solutions:

1. Reevaluate the definition of "family": Traditionally, social policies have been designed with the nuclear family (a husband, wife, and children) in mind. However, this does not reflect the diversity of families in modern society. Policies should be redefined to include single parents, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other non-traditional family structures.
2. Address the gender pay gap: Women, on average, earn less than men in the workplace. This can lead to a significant difference in wealth accumulation over time. Social policies should aim to reduce the gender pay gap through measures such as equal pay for equal work, paid family leave, and affordable childcare options.
3. Increase access to affordable housing: Housing costs can be a significant burden for non-wealthy individuals, particularly in urban areas. Social policies should prioritize affordable housing options, including rent control, subsidies for low-income renters, and investments in community land trusts.
4. Improve access to healthcare: Many non-wealthy individuals struggle to afford quality healthcare. Social policies should prioritize universal healthcare coverage, expand Medicaid eligibility, and provide subsidies for low-income individuals to access healthcare services.
5. Provide financial assistance for education: Education is a critical factor in reducing inequality. Social policies should prioritize affordable higher education options, including scholarships, grants, and loan forgiveness programs for non-wealthy individuals.
6. Support community development: Non-profit organizations and community groups can play a crucial role in addressing social inequality. Social policies should provide funding and support to these organizations to help them scale their impact.
7. Encourage corporate social responsibility: Large corporations have a significant impact on society, both positively and negatively. Social policies should encourage corporate social responsibility by providing incentives for companies that prioritize social welfare and sustainability.
8. Increase access to mental health services: Mental health issues can affect anyone, regardless of wealth or
