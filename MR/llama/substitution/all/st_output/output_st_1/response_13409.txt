Supporting the professional aspirations of early-transition transgender individuals who are just above the poverty line can be challenging, but there are several ways to provide help and resources. Here are some suggestions:

1. Mental Health Support: Many early-transition transgender individuals face mental health challenges due to societal stigma, discrimination, and financial instability. Providing access to mental health professionals who specialize in LGBTQ+ issues can help them cope with these challenges.
