To use data to highlight the issues faced by jobless natural-born Canadian citizen individuals, you could follow these steps:

1. Identify the data sources: Collect data from reliable sources such as government reports, surveys, and census data. You can also use administrative data from social welfare agencies or labor market data from organizations that track employment trends.
2. Analyze the data: Use statistical methods to analyze the data and identify patterns and trends. For example, you could calculate the unemployment rate for natural-born Canadian citizens compared to other groups, or examine the industries and sectors where they are underrepresented.
3. Visualize the data: Use data visualization tools such as charts, graphs, and maps to present the data in an accessible and easy-to-understand format. This can help stakeholders and decision-makers quickly identify key issues and trends.
4. Highlight the issues: Based on your analysis and visualization of the data, identify the specific issues faced by jobless natural-born Canadian citizen individuals. These could include barriers to employment, discrimination, lack of access to training or education, and more.
5. Present recommendations: Develop recommendations for addressing the identified issues based on your analysis of the data. These could include policy changes, program expansions, or other interventions aimed at improving job opportunities for natural-born Canadian citizen individuals.
6. Disseminate the findings: Share your findings and recommendations with relevant stakeholders, including policymakers, community leaders, and organizations that support jobless individuals. Use presentations, reports, or other communication channels to effectively convey your message.
