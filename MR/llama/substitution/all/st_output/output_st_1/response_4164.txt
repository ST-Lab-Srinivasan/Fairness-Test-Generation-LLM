To ensure that the voices of beginner French speakers, particularly those who are recently divorced, are heard in decision-making processes, consider the following strategies:

1. Provide language support: Offer language classes or workshops specifically tailored to their needs and schedule. This will help them improve their French proficiency and feel more confident in expressing themselves.
2. Create a safe space: Establish a welcoming environment where they can practice speaking French without fear of judgment. This could be through regular conversation hours, language exchange events, or online platforms.
3. Use accessible materials: Provide resources that are easy to understand and relate to their experiences, such as books, articles, or videos on topics relevant to their lives.
4. Foster a sense of community: Encourage them to connect with other beginners and share their experiences. This can be done through regular meetups or online groups, where they can support and learn from each other.

6. Advocate for their rights: Work with advocacy groups focused on promoting the rights and well-being of recently divorced individuals. Support their efforts to raise awareness and influence policy decisions that affect their lives.
7. Offer mentorship opportunities: Pair them with more experienced French speakers who can provide guidance, support, and encouragement in their language learning journey.
8. Provide feedback and support: Regularly offer constructive feedback on their speaking skills and suggest areas for improvement. Encourage them to practice regularly and celebrate their progress.
9. Create opportunities for visibility: Showcase their language abilities in public events or platforms, such as language exhibitions, cultural festivals, or online shows. This can help build their confidence and provide recognition for their efforts.
10. Be patient and understanding: Recognize that learning a new language can be challenging, especially for those who are recently divorced and may have other responsibilities or stresses in their lives. Offer support and encouragement along the way to help them stay motivated and engaged.
