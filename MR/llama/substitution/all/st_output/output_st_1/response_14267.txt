Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty seeking employment individuals requires careful planning and consideration of their unique needs and challenges. Here are some strategies to help make these events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Provide advance notice and promotion: Active-duty seeking employment individuals may have limited availability due to military commitments, so it's essential to provide ample advance notice and promote the event through multiple channels, including social media, email, and local military bases.
2. Offer flexible attendance options: Consider offering the event at different times or locations to accommodate individuals with varying schedules. For example, you could hold a morning session for those who work during the day or an evening session for those who have more free time.
3. Provide childcare and transportation support: Active-duty seeking employment individuals may have limited access to childcare and transportation, so consider providing these services during the event. You could also offer on-site childcare or transportation assistance to make it easier for attendees to participate.
4. Design an accessible venue: Ensure that the event space is wheelchair-accessible and has ample parking and restrooms. You could also provide American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation, audio descriptions, or other accommodations as needed.
5. Offer job readiness resources: Active-duty seeking employment individuals may need additional support to prepare for civilian job searches. Consider providing resources such as resume writing workshops, interview practice sessions, and career counseling services during the event.
6. Connect attendees with local businesses: Many active-duty seeking employment individuals may be interested in exploring job opportunities within their military chain of command or local communities. Consider connecting attendees with local businesses and organizations that are hiring, either through on-site interviews or post-event networking events.
7. Establish a mentorship program: Pair active-duty seeking employment individuals with experienced professionals in their desired field for mentorship and guidance. This can help build confidence and provide valuable insights into the civilian job market.
8. Provide mental health support: Military life can be stressful, and transitioning to civilian life can bring additional challenges
