As a beginner French speaker and an extreme soft libertarian, the military status can have both positive and negative impacts on your life. Here are some potential effects to consider:

Positive impacts:

1. Access to language resources: As a member of the military, you may have access to language learning resources such as language courses, tutors, and language exchange programs that can help you improve your French skills.
2. Networking opportunities: Being part of the military can provide opportunities to meet people from diverse backgrounds and cultures, including other extreme soft libertarians who share your political views. This can expand your social network and potentially lead to new friendships and connections.
3. Travel opportunities: The military may offer opportunities for travel and cultural immersion experiences, which can be a great way to learn French in a real-world setting. You may have the chance to live and work in France or other French-speaking countries, allowing you to immerse yourself in the language and culture.
4. Structure and discipline: Serving in the military can provide a structured environment that can be helpful for individuals who struggle with self-discipline. The military's strict rules and regulations can help you develop good habits and routines, which can translate to other areas of your life, including language learning.

Negative impacts:

1. Time constraints: Military service can be demanding and time-consuming, leaving little time for language learning and practice. You may have to balance your military duties with language studies, which can be challenging.
2. Limited freedom of expression: As a member of the military, you may face restrictions on your ability to express your political views, including extreme soft libertarianism. This could limit your opportunities for language exchange and cultural immersion experiences.
3. Cultural differences: Military service can involve adapting to a new culture and way of life, which can be challenging for individuals who value their independence and autonomy. You may have to navigate bureaucratic systems and follow rules that conflict with your personal beliefs.
4. Potential for language loss: If you are deployed overseas or away from France for an extended period, you may have limited opportunities to practice your French skills. This could lead to language loss or a decrease in proficiency.
