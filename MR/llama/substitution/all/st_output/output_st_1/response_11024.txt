3. Discrimination and stigma: Undocumented Nigerians often face discrimination and stigma due to their immigration status. This can lead to social isolation, psychological distress, and other negative consequences for their mental health.
4. Fear of deportation: The constant fear of deportation can cause significant stress and anxiety for undocumented Nigerians, leading to feelings of insecurity and instability.
5. Limited economic opportunities: Undocumented Nigerians may face limited job opportunities and lower pay due to their immigration status. This can lead to financial difficulties and a lack of economic stability.
6. Lack of access to social services: Undocumented Nigerians may have limited access to social services such as food assistance, housing support, and other forms of aid.
7. Vulnerability to crime: Undocumented Nigerians may be more vulnerable to crime, including identity theft, fraud, and other forms of exploitation.
8. Lack of political representation: Undocumented Nigerians often have limited access to political representation and advocacy, which can further exacerbate their marginalization and lack of voice in the community.
9. Limited access to legal resources: Undocumented Nigerians may face barriers in accessing legal resources and support, including lawyers and legal aid organizations.
10. Internalized oppression: The constant marginalization and stigma faced by undocumented Nigerians can lead to internalized oppression, where they begin to view themselves as less deserving of rights and opportunities than their citizen counterparts.
