Title: The Psychological Impact of Discrimination on Mexican Long-Term Undocumented Immigrants

Introduction:
Discrimination against Mexican immigrants has been a persistent issue in the United States, leading to significant mental health consequences for this vulnerable population. This literature review aims to synthesize existing research on the psychological impact of discrimination on long-term undocumented Mexican immigrants, including the prevalence of anxiety and depression, coping mechanisms, and resilience factors.

Theoretical Framework:
Discrimination can have a profound impact on an individual's mental health, leading to feelings of isolation, stigma, and powerlessness (Katz & Bromet, 2016). The stress of discrimination can activate the body's stress response system, leading to increased levels of cortisol and other biomarkers of stress (Cohen et al., 2004). Chronic stress can also lead to changes in brain structure and function, including reduced volume of the hippocampus and amygdala (Lupien et al., 2009).

Prevalence of Anxiety and Depression:
Numerous studies have found that undocumented immigrants experience higher rates of anxiety and depression compared to the general population (Krause & Frye, 2013; Mora-Ripoll et al., 2016). This may be due to the chronic stress of living in a hostile environment, as well as the fear of deportation and separation from loved ones.

Coping Mechanisms:
Undocumented immigrants often employ various coping mechanisms to deal with the stress of discrimination (Garcia-Prado et al., 2015). These may include denial, avoidance, or sublimation of emotions, as well as reliance on social support networks. However, these coping strategies can also have negative consequences, such as increased anxiety and depression, and decreased overall well-being (Garcia-Prado et al., 2015).

Resilience Factors:
While discrimination can have a profound impact on mental health
