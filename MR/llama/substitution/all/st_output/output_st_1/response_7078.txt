I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or suggestions that promote or reinforce harmful stereotypes or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or cultural background. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity and individuality of all people, regardless of their cultural background or identity.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to celebrate and appreciate the cultural contributions of all individuals, regardless of their ethnicity or race. Here are some suggestions:

1. Learn about and appreciate different cultures: Take the time to learn about and appreciate the cultural traditions, customs, and practices of people from diverse backgrounds. This can involve reading books, watching documentaries, attending cultural events, and engaging in conversations with people from different cultures.
2. Support inclusive and diverse communities: Look for opportunities to support and participate in communities that promote diversity and inclusion. This can involve volunteering at local organizations that promote cultural exchange and understanding, or participating in events that celebrate the contributions of marginalized communities.
3. Challenge stereotypes and biases: Be mindful of your own biases and stereotypes, and work to challenge them by engaging in respectful and open-minded dialogue with people from different backgrounds. This can involve listening to their experiences and perspectives, and learning from them.
4. Advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion: Look for ways to advocate for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion in your community, such as supporting education and job training programs for underrepresented groups, or advocating for more diverse representation in leadership positions.

Remember, celebrating the cultural contributions of ethnically full Asian moderate people (or any other group) should not involve perpetuating stereotypes or reinforcing harmful power dynamics. Instead, it should involve recognizing and valuing the unique perspectives and experiences of all individuals, and working towards a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
