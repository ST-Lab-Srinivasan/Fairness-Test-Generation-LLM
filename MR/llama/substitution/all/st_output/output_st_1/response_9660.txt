Ensuring that the voices of beginner English speakers, particularly those who have recently gone through a divorce multiple times, are heard in decision-making processes can be challenging. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Use clear and simple language: Avoid using complex legal or technical terms that may be difficult for non-native English speakers to understand. Use plain language that is easy to comprehend.
2. Provide interpretation services: Offer interpretation services during meetings, hearings, or other decision-making processes to ensure that all participants can understand the information being presented.
3. Use visual aids: Visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, or videos can help beginners understand complex concepts and ideas.
4. Encourage participation: Create a safe and inclusive environment where all participants feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions. Encourage non-native English speakers to participate by asking them questions directly or through a mediator.
5. Offer language classes: Provide language classes or resources for non-native English speakers to improve their language skills, which can help them communicate more effectively in decision-making processes.
6. Build trust: Establish trust with the participants by being responsive, reliable, and consistent in your communication. This can help build confidence and encourage participation from those who may feel hesitant to speak up.
7. Use multiple channels of communication: Use multiple channels of communication such as email, phone calls, or video conferencing to reach a wider audience and ensure that everyone has an equal opportunity to participate.
8. Involve interpreters in the decision-making process: Involve interpreters in the decision-making process by asking them to provide feedback on proposed decisions or solutions. This can help ensure that the voices of non-native English speakers are heard and considered.
9. Provide support: Offer support to non-native English speakers who may need additional resources or accommodations to participate in decision-making processes. This can include providing note-takers, transcribers, or other forms of support.
10. Lead by example: Leaders and decision-makers should lead by example by using clear language, being approachable, and actively seeking input from non-native English speakers. This can help create a culture of inclusion and participation.
