Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for young adult native English speakers requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make these events more welcoming and engaging for all participants:

1. Representation Matters: Ensure that the cultural celebration reflects the diversity of the community. Involve individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities in the planning process. This can be done by having a diverse planning committee or by actively seeking input from underrepresented groups.
2. Accessibility: Make sure the event is accessible to all attendees. This includes providing accommodations for individuals with disabilities, offering vegan or vegetarian options for food and drinks, and ensuring that the venue is wheelchair-friendly.
3. Involve the Community: Encourage community involvement by inviting local artists, performers, and musicians to participate in the celebration. This can help create a sense of belonging and connection among attendees.
4. Education and Cultural Exchange: Offer cultural workshops or sessions where attendees can learn about different cultures and traditions. This can include cooking classes, language lessons, or traditional dance performances.
5. Interactive Activities: Incorporate interactive activities that allow attendees to engage with each other and the cultural celebration. Examples include cultural scavenger hunts, group games, or art-making stations.
6. Flexible Format: Offer a flexible format for the event, such as a potluck or a DIY craft station. This allows attendees to participate in a way that feels most comfortable and enjoyable for them.
7. Respectful Representation: Be mindful of cultural representation and appropriation. Avoid using cultural elements as a prop or decoration without proper understanding, permission, or credit. Instead, center the voices and experiences of marginalized communities in the celebration.
8. Collaboration with Local Organizations: Partner with local organizations that support diverse communities to co-host the event. This can help amplify the reach and impact of the celebration.
9. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive and respectful of all identities. Avoid using terms or phrases that may be off
