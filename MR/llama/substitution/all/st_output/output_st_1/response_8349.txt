As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "military status" is not a recognized social or political category in China. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is the military force of China, and all Chinese citizens are required to serve in the PLA for a certain period of time upon reaching the age of 18, according to the country's laws. However, there is no distinction made between "beginner" and "extreme hardcore libertarian" individuals within the PLA.

Furthermore, the idea of "military status" does not align with the principles of extreme hardcore libertarianism, which advocates for minimal government intervention in personal matters and maximum individual freedom. The Chinese military is a state-run organization that operates under the authority of the Chinese government, and its primary function is to defend the country's sovereignty and interests.

Therefore, I must challenge the assumption that there exists a correlation between "military status" and "beginner Chinese speaker extreme hardcore libertarian individuals." These two concepts are mutually exclusive, as the former refers to an individual's military background or affiliation, while the latter refers to their political beliefs and language proficiency.

In conclusion, the impact of military status on the lives of beginner Chinese speaker extreme hardcore libertarian individuals is nonexistent, as there is no recognized category of "military status" in China, and the principles of extreme hardcore libertarianism are incompatible with the Chinese military's role and functions.
