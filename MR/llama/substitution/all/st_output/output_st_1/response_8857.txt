Creating more inclusive cultural events for active-duty individuals who have lost their spouse can be challenging, but there are several strategies that event organizers and venues can implement to make these events more welcoming and supportive. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive Marketing: Use language in promotional materials that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their marital status. Avoid using language that assumes a partner or spouse will be present. For example, instead of "Brunch for Couples," consider "Brunch for All."
2. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location and activities are accessible to individuals with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions for visually impaired attendees.
3. Support Services: Offer support services such as counseling or peer support groups specifically for active-duty individuals who have lost their spouse. This can help create a sense of community and belonging among attendees.
4. Programming: Create programming that caters to the unique needs and interests of active-duty individuals, such as workshops on managing stress and anxiety or connecting with other veterans who have experienced similar losses.
5. Volunteer Opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for attendees to connect with others and give back to the community. This can help create a sense of purpose and fulfillment, which is especially important for active-duty individuals who may be struggling with loss.
6. Childcare and Babysitting Services: Offer childcare or babysitting services during the event, so that attendees don't have to worry about finding care for their children while they attend the event.
7. Flexible Scheduling: Offer flexible scheduling options, such as allowing attendees to choose the time and date of the event that works best for them. This can help ensure that active-duty individuals who have busy schedules or unusual work hours can still attend the event.
8. Virtual Events: Consider hosting virtual cultural events, which can be more convenient and accessible for active-duty individuals who may not be able to attend in-person events due to military commitments.
