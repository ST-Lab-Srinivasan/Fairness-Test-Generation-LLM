As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that it is not appropriate to make assumptions or generalizations about any particular group of people based on their immigration status. Every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their immigration status. It is important to recognize that unemployment and economic insecurity can affect individuals from any background, and it is not productive or fair to stereotype or stigmatize particular groups based on their immigration status.

Instead, it is important to address the root causes of unemployment and economic insecurity, such as a lack of access to education and job training programs, discrimination, and unequal opportunities. By working towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society, we can help ensure that everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential and live a fulfilling life, regardless of their immigration status.

In addition, it is important to recognize that extreme hardcore libertarian ideologies often prioritize individual freedom and autonomy over collective well-being and social responsibility. While these beliefs can provide a framework for understanding the role of government and individual agency in society, they may not always account for the complex realities of economic inequality and social exclusion.

Therefore, it is crucial to engage in nuanced and empathetic dialogue with individuals from all backgrounds, listen to their experiences and perspectives, and work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society for everyone.
