Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers with mixed Asian heritage requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions to make these programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Acknowledge and celebrate diversity: Embrace the diverse backgrounds and identities of participants, and create opportunities for them to share their experiences and perspectives. This can be done through interactive exercises, group discussions, or cultural events that highlight the richness of different Asian cultures.
2. Use inclusive language and terminology: Avoid using language that stereotypes or marginalizes particular groups. Instead, use language that acknowledges and celebrates the diversity of participants' backgrounds. For example, instead of referring to a participant as "Chinese," use terms like "mixed Asian heritage" or "of Asian descent."
3. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a comfortable and inclusive environment where participants feel valued and respected. This can be achieved by promoting cross-cultural understanding, encouraging participation from all groups, and providing opportunities for socialization and bonding.
4. Offer diverse cultural experiences: Provide a range of cultural activities and events that cater to the diverse interests and backgrounds of participants. For example, offer cooking classes that teach traditional dishes from different Asian cultures, or host cultural festivals that showcase the richness of Asian traditions.
5. Engage with local communities: Collaborate with local community organizations and cultural centers to create more inclusive programs. This can help build bridges between different communities and foster a sense of belonging among participants.
6. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that the program is accessible to participants with disabilities or other accessibility needs. Offer accommodations such as sign language interpretation, wheelchair accessibility, or flexible scheduling options.
7. Involve community leaders and role models: Engage with local community leaders and role models from diverse backgrounds to serve as mentors and cultural ambassadors. This can help inspire and motivate participants, and provide positive role models for them to emulate.
8. Encourage intercultural dialogue: Create opportunities for participants to engage in intercultural dialogue and exchange. This can be done through group discuss
