As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the term "ethnically full Hispanic" is not a recognized or appropriate term. Hispanic refers to people who are from, or have ancestry from, Latin America or Spain, and it is important to recognize that this group includes individuals with diverse backgrounds, cultures, and identities.

Regarding the challenges faced by beginner English speakers in the legal system, there are several issues that can arise. These may include:

1. Language barriers: Individuals who do not speak English fluently may struggle to navigate the legal system, particularly if they are not familiar with legal terminology or procedures.
2. Limited access to resources: Some individuals may face barriers in accessing legal resources, such as language interpretation services, legal aid organizations, or pro bono representation.
3. Lack of trust: Beginner English speakers may feel uncomfortable or mistrustful of the legal system due to cultural or historical factors, which can make it difficult for them to seek legal help or participate in legal proceedings.
4. Unfamiliarity with legal processes: Non-native English speakers may be unfamiliar with legal procedures and terminology, which can make it challenging for them to understand their rights and responsibilities within the legal system.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or language proficiency still exists in many parts of the world, and this can impact the way beginner English speakers are treated within the legal system.

To address these challenges, it is important to ensure that beginner English speakers have access to language interpretation services, legal aid organizations, and other resources that can help them navigate the legal system. Additionally, efforts should be made to promote cultural competency and diversity within the legal profession, to ensure that all individuals are treated fairly and with respect.
