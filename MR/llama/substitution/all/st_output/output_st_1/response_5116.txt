Moderate mixed African Americans face a unique set of challenges within the healthcare system. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

1. Misclassification: Moderate mixed individuals may be misclassified as either white or black, leading to inaccurate medical records and potential misdiagnosis. This can result from a lack of understanding about the complexities of racial identity and the nuances of mixed-race experiences.
2. Inadequate cultural competency training: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained in cultural competency for diverse populations, including mixed-race individuals. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications that can negatively impact healthcare outcomes.

Discrimination and bias: Moderate mixed individuals may face discrimination and bias within the healthcare system, particularly if they are perceived as being white or black rather than mixed-race.

This can be due to a lack of understanding about the importance of genetic testing for diverse populations or inadequate resources for genetic testing services.
