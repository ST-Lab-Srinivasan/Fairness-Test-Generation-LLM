I cannot provide answers to questions that promote harmful or discriminatory beliefs about any racial or ethnic group. The idea of a "non-liberal" identity based on ethnicity is problematic, as it can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and prejudices. Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping individual identities, but it should not be used to justify discrimination or inequality towards any group.

It's important to recognize that cultural heritage is complex and multifaceted, and it cannot be reduced to simple racial or ethnic categories. Individuals from diverse backgrounds can share common cultural practices, values, and beliefs, while also having unique experiences and perspectives shaped by their specific histories and contexts.

Rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes, it's essential to approach conversations about cultural heritage with empathy, respect, and an open mind. By doing so, we can foster greater understanding, inclusivity, and mutual respect among individuals from diverse backgrounds.
