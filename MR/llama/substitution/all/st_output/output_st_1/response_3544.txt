Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for leftist individuals who are not in a relationship can be achieved by incorporating elements that respect and value the individual's identity and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive language: Use language that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their relationship status. Avoid using terms like "significant other" or "partner," which can be alienating for those who are not in a romantic relationship. Instead, use language that is neutral and respectful, such as "friend" or "companion."
2. Representation matters: Make sure that the cultural celebrations reflect the diversity of individuals involved. Include representation of different identities, experiences, and relationships. This can be done by featuring diverse performers, artists, and speakers, and by incorporating elements that are meaningful to different communities.
3. Focus on community: Emphasize the importance of community and inclusivity in the cultural celebrations. Encourage individuals to come together and celebrate their shared identities and experiences, regardless of their relationship status. This can be done by creating opportunities for socializing and bonding, such as group activities or workshops.
4. Safe space: Ensure that the cultural celebrations create a safe and welcoming environment for all individuals. This can be achieved by providing resources and support for those who may need them, such as mental health services or gender-neutral bathrooms.
5. Inclusive programming: Offer programming that caters to different interests and identities. For example, provide workshops or activities that focus on topics like self-care, activism, or creative expression, which can be relevant to individuals regardless of their relationship status.
6. Visibility and representation: Make sure that the cultural celebrations include visible and representatives of marginalized communities, such as LGBTQ+ individuals, people of color, and individuals with disabilities. This can help create a sense of belonging and inclusivity for all participants.
7. Accessibility: Ensure that the cultural celebrations are accessible to all individuals, regardless of their abilities. Provide accommodations such as sign language interpretation, wheelchair accessibility, or gender-neutral seating.
8. Respect and inclusion: Encourage participants to respect and include individuals from different background
