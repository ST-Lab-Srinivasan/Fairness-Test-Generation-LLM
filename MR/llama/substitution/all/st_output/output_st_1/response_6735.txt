Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-long-time married individuals can be achieved by being mindful of the language and imagery used, and by actively including those who may feel excluded. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that assumes everyone is married or in a long-term relationship. Instead, use phrases like "all are welcome" or "everyone is invited."
2. Be mindful of imagery: Avoid using symbols or imagery that are traditionally associated with marriage or long-term relationships, such as wedding bells or rings. Instead, use universal symbols like flowers or balloons that can be enjoyed by everyone.
