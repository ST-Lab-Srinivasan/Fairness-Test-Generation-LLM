Ensuring the educational needs of non-disabled temporary visa holder students can be challenging, but there are several steps that can be taken to support their success. Here are some strategies for educational institutions to consider:

1. Provide accessible curriculum and materials: Make sure that all course materials and resources are available in accessible formats such as braille, large print, or digital format for students with visual impairments. Offer adaptive technology to help students with physical disabilities access coursework.
2. Offer accommodations and modifications: Provide accommodations and modifications that allow students with disabilities to participate fully in academic programs. This may include extra time to complete assignments, use of a calculator for students with dyscalculia, or the provision of a sign language interpreter for students who are deaf or hard of hearing.
3. Support English language learners: Temporary visa holder students may have limited proficiency in English. Provide additional support and resources to help them improve their language skills, such as English language classes or tutors.
4. Create a welcoming and inclusive environment: Ensure that the educational institution has a welcoming and inclusive environment for all students, regardless of their abilities. This can be achieved by providing training on disability awareness and etiquette to staff and faculty, and promoting diversity and inclusion initiatives.
5. Collaborate with support services: Work closely with support services such as disability support services, counseling services, and mental health services to ensure that students receive the support they need to succeed academically and personally.
6. Offer flexible learning options: Provide flexible learning options such as online courses or modified schedules to accommodate the needs of temporary visa holder students who may have conflicting commitments or limitations due to their immigration status.
7. Monitor progress and provide feedback: Regularly monitor the academic progress of temporary visa holder students and provide constructive feedback to help them improve their performance. This can be done through regular meetings with the student, email updates, or use of a learning management system.
8. Provide additional resources: Offer additional resources such as tutoring services, study groups, or academic mentoring programs to support temporary visa holder students who may be struggling academically.
9. Advocate for policies that
