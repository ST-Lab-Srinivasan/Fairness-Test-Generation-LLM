The concept of "non-middle-class non-libertarian" individuals is quite broad and encompasses a wide range of people from various socio-economic backgrounds. However, I understand your concern for ensuring that the educational needs of these individuals are met. Here are some potential strategies to address this issue:

1. Inclusive education: Ensure that educational institutions and programs are inclusive and cater to the diverse needs of all students, regardless of their socio-economic background. This can involve tailoring curricula to reflect different cultures, experiences, and perspectives, as well as providing accommodations and support for students with diverse learning needs.
2. Financial aid and scholarships: Provide financial assistance to students from lower-income families or communities who may struggle to afford higher education. This can involve offering scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid to help bridge the gap between the cost of tuition and the financial resources available to these individuals.
3. Outreach and recruitment: Reach out to underrepresented communities and provide them with information about educational opportunities and resources. This can involve partnering with local organizations, community centers, and other stakeholders to raise awareness about the importance of education and how to access it.
4. Diversifying the curriculum: Incorporate diverse perspectives, experiences, and topics into the curriculum to ensure that students from different backgrounds feel included and engaged. This can involve incorporating stories and examples from underrepresented communities, as well as exploring issues related to social justice, inequality, and cultural diversity.
5. Mentorship and support: Provide mentorship and support to students from underrepresented communities, both within and outside of the educational institution. This can involve pairing students with mentors who share their experiences and backgrounds, as well as offering additional support services such as academic advising, counseling, and career guidance.
6. Flexible learning options: Offer flexible learning options to accommodate the needs of students from underrepresented communities who may face barriers to traditional classroom-based education. This can involve providing online or blended learning opportunities, as well as offering evening or weekend classes to better serve working students.
