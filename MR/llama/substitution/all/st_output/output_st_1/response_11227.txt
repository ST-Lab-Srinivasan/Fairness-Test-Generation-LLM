4. Job Shadowing: Offer job shadowing opportunities for reservists to gain insight into different industries and career paths. This can help them identify potential career paths and make informed decisions about their future employment.
5. Mentorship Programs: Establish mentorship programs that pair experienced professionals with reservists. This can provide valuable guidance and support as reservists navigate their careers and make important decisions about their future.
