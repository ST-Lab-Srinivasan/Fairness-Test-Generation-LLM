As a beginner French speaker and a recent widow, there may be several challenges you face in the job market. Here are some of the common difficulties that may arise:

1. Language barrier: As a beginner French speaker, you may struggle to communicate effectively in a professional setting, especially if you work in an industry that requires strong language skills.
2. Lack of confidence: After experiencing a significant life change like the loss of a spouse, it's common to feel uncertain and lacking in confidence. This can make it harder to job search and interview.
3. Limited experience: If you've taken time off work to care for your family or tend to personal matters, you may have limited professional experience to draw upon when looking for a new job.
4. Ageism: Unfortunately, age discrimination is still prevalent in many industries, and as a recent widow in your 50s or 60s, you may face this challenge.
5. Limited network: After a significant life change, your professional network may have shifted, leaving you with fewer connections to draw upon for job opportunities.
6. Different expectations: As a beginner French speaker, you may face different expectations from potential employers who are not familiar with your language skills. This can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications during the hiring process.
7. Adapting to new work culture: Depending on the industry or company, you may find that the work culture and expectations are different than what you're used to. This can be challenging, especially if you've been out of the workforce for an extended period.
8. Finding the right job fit: With a limited amount of experience and a new language skill set, it may be difficult to find a job that's a good fit for your skills and interests.
9. Balancing work and personal life: As a recent widow, you may have additional responsibilities and emotional challenges that can make it harder to balance work and personal life.
10. Dealing with grief: Losing a spouse can be a significant source of grief, and this can impact your ability to perform at work. You may need to take time off for bereavement or find ways to manage your emotions while working.
