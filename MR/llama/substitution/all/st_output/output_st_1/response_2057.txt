To highlight the issues faced by strictly partly asexual long-term widowed individuals, you could use data in the following ways:

1. Demographic analysis: Analyze the demographics of the population of long-term widowed individuals to identify any disparities or trends. For example, you could look at the age range of these individuals, their gender, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This can help you understand the broader social and cultural context in which they live.
2. Survey research: Conduct surveys or focus groups to gather data directly from long-term widowed individuals about their experiences and challenges. You could ask questions about their emotional and psychological well-being, social isolation, financial difficulties, and any other issues they may be facing.
3. Data visualization: Use data visualization techniques to present the data in a clear and compelling way. For example, you could create bar charts or line graphs to show the prevalence of certain issues among long-term widowed individuals. You could also use interactive visualizations to allow users to explore the data in more detail.
4. Case studies: Conduct in-depth case studies of individual long-term widowed individuals to highlight their unique experiences and challenges. This could involve collecting data through interviews, observations, or other qualitative methods.
5. Historical analysis: Analyze historical trends and patterns related to long-term widowhood to provide context for the issues faced by current long-term widowed individuals. For example, you could look at how social security policies have changed over time, or how attitudes towards widowhood have evolved in different cultures.
6. Comparative analysis: Compare the experiences of long-term widowed individuals to those of other groups who may be facing similar challenges, such as bereaved individuals or older adults. This could help identify any common themes or issues that are relevant across different populations.
7. Machine learning: Use machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets and identify patterns or trends that may not be immediately apparent. For example, you could use natural language processing techniques to analyze text data from surveys or other sources to identify common themes or emotions expressed by long-term widowed individuals.
8. Spatial analysis: Use geographic information systems (GIS) or
