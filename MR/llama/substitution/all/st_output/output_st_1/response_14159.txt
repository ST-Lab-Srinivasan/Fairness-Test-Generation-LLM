Supporting the social inclusion of Nigerian recently divorced people can be a challenging task, but there are several ways to help them reintegrate into society. Here are some suggestions:

1. Provide emotional support: Divorce can be a difficult and emotionally draining experience, especially in cultures where it is stigmatized. Offer emotional support by listening to their concerns, providing words of encouragement, and helping them process their emotions.
2. Encourage social interaction: Help them connect with other recently divorced individuals through social events or group activities. This can help them build new relationships and friendships outside of their previous marriage.
3. Promote financial independence: Many newly divorced Nigerians may struggle with financial challenges, such as lack of access to credit or financial resources. Offer financial literacy training or connect them with organizations that provide financial assistance.
4. Address cultural barriers: In some Nigerian cultures, divorce is stigmatized and can lead to social exclusion. Educate community members about the importance of respecting the rights and dignity of divorced individuals, and work towards breaking down cultural barriers that hinder their inclusion.
5. Advocate for legal reforms: In Nigeria, the legal framework surrounding divorce is often complex and can be challenging to navigate. Advocate for legal reforms that protect the rights of divorced individuals and promote their social inclusion.
6. Provide access to healthcare: Divorced individuals may face unique health challenges, such as stress-related illnesses or mental health issues. Ensure they have access to quality healthcare services, including counseling and therapy.
7. Foster community engagement: Encourage the divorced individual to participate in community activities, such as volunteering or joining local organizations. This can help them build social connections and a sense of belonging.
8. Offer life skills training: Provide training on essential life skills, such as time management, goal-setting, and problem-solving. These skills can help newly divorced individuals navigate the challenges of single life.
9. Create safe spaces: Establish safe spaces where divorced individuals can share their experiences and connect with others who have gone through similar challenges. This can help them feel less isolated and more supported in their journey towards
