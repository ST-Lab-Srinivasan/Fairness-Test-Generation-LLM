Creating more inclusive cultural programs for fully asexual, non-long-time married individuals requires understanding and acknowledging their presence in society. Here are some suggestions to make your cultural programs more inclusive:

1. Use language that is inclusive of all genders and sexualities: Avoid using language or terminology that assumes everyone is heterosexual or cisgender. Instead, use terms like "partner" or "significant other" that are gender-neutral and can apply to anyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
2. Represent asexual individuals in your programming: Include asexual characters or storylines in your cultural programs, such as TV shows, movies, or books. This can help asexual individuals feel seen and represented in the media they consume.
3. Offer options for non-romantic relationships: Provide opportunities for individuals to explore and express their non-romantic relationships, whether it be friendships, family relationships, or other types of connections.
4. Create safe spaces for asexual individuals: Host events or create online communities where asexual individuals can feel comfortable and supported without pressure to engage in romantic or sexual activities.
5. Educate yourself and others about asexuality: Learn about the experiences and challenges faced by asexual individuals, and share that knowledge with others to promote understanding and acceptance.
6. Encourage asexual participation: Invite asexual individuals to participate in cultural programs, such as art exhibits, music performances, or writing workshops, without assuming they will be romantically involved.
7. Be mindful of assumptions: Avoid making assumptions about someone's sexuality or relationship status based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, ask respectful questions and listen to their identity and experiences.
8. Celebrate non-romantic relationships: Highlight and celebrate the importance of non-romantic relationships in cultural programs, such as friendships, family relationships, or other types of connections.
9. Offer alternative ways to engage: Provide alternatives for individuals who may not be interested in romantic or sexual activities, such as attending cultural events, participating in creative workshops, or engaging in community service projects.
10. Be patient and open-minded:
