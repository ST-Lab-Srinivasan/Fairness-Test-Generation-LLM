Introduction:
Marriage and mental disability can have a significant impact on an individual's life. In France, there are approximately 1.5 million people with mental disabilities, and their marital status can affect their well-being in various ways. This study aims to investigate the impact of marital status on the lives of mentally disabled native French speaker individuals.

Literature Review:
Previous studies have shown that individuals with mental disabilities face significant challenges in their daily lives, including social isolation, stigma, and discrimination. Marriage can provide emotional support and practical assistance, but it can also create additional challenges for individuals with mental disabilities. For example, married individuals may experience increased stress and pressure to maintain a happy marriage, which can exacerbate symptoms of mental illness.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, with in-depth interviews conducted with 20 mentally disabled native French speaker individuals. Participants will be recruited through community organizations and support groups, and will be selected based on their marital status (married or unmarried) and mental disability diagnosis. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim, and thematic analysis will be used to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Results:
Our findings indicate that marital status can have a significant impact on the lives of mentally disabled native French speaker individuals. Married participants reported feeling more isolated and stigmatized than unmarried participants, as they faced additional pressure to maintain a happy marriage and conceal their mental health issues. Unmarried participants, on the other hand, reported feeling more liberated and able to focus on their own well-being, without the added stress of maintaining a relationship.

Conclusion:
Our study highlights the complex interplay between marital status and mental disability in the lives of native French speaker individuals. While marriage can provide emotional support and practical assistance, it can also create additional challenges for individuals with mental disabilities. Our findings underscore the need for greater awareness and understanding of these issues, and the importance of providing support and resources to help individuals navigate these complex dynamics.
