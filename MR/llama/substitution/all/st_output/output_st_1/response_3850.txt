Supporting the civic engagement of recent immigrants to Canada who are carriers of genetic conditions can be challenging, but there are several ways to encourage their participation in the political process:

1. Language Support: Provide language support services such as translation and interpretation to help them access information and participate in civic activities.
2. Cultural Sensitivity: Be culturally sensitive and aware of their background and experiences, recognizing that their perspectives and beliefs are valuable.
3. Accessibility: Make sure that polling stations and other civic spaces are accessible to people with disabilities, including those who may have mobility or sensory impairments.
4. Education and Awareness: Provide education and awareness campaigns on the importance of civic engagement and how it can impact their lives, particularly for those who may be marginalized or underrepresented.
5. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that promote inclusive civic participation, such as accessible voting systems, flexible voting hours, and online voting options.
6. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to connect with recent immigrants and build trust between them and local authorities.
7. Healthcare Access: Ensure that they have access to quality healthcare services, including genetic counseling and testing, to help them make informed decisions about their health and well-being.
8. Legal Support: Provide legal support and resources to help them navigate the Canadian legal system, including information on their rights and responsibilities as citizens.
9. Civic Engagement Programs: Develop programs that encourage civic engagement among recent immigrants, such as voter registration drives, citizen education workshops, and community volunteer opportunities.
10. Partnerships: Collaborate with community organizations and advocacy groups to reach out to recent immigrants and provide them with information and support on how to participate in the civic process.

By implementing these strategies, you can help ensure that recent immigrants who are carriers of genetic conditions feel included and empowered to participate fully in Canadian society.
