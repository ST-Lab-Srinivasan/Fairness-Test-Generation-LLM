Low-earning nationals in the healthcare system face several challenges that hinder their access to quality healthcare services. These challenges include:

1. Limited financial resources: Low-earning nationals often struggle to afford healthcare services, particularly when it comes to expensive treatments or procedures. They may have to choose between paying for healthcare and other basic needs such as housing, food, and education.
2. Lack of access to health insurance: Many low-earning nationals do not have access to health insurance, which means they have to pay out-of-pocket for medical services. This can be a significant burden, especially for those living in poverty.
3. Limited access to healthcare facilities: Low-earning nationals may live in areas with limited access to healthcare facilities, such as rural or remote communities. This can make it difficult for them to receive timely and appropriate medical care.
4. Language barriers: In countries with diverse populations, low-earning nationals may face language barriers that can hinder their ability to communicate effectively with healthcare providers. This can lead to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses, which can have serious consequences for their health.
5. Cultural barriers: Low-earning nationals may come from cultural backgrounds that have different beliefs and practices related to healthcare. For example, some cultures may have traditional healing practices that are not recognized by the formal healthcare system. This can lead to conflicts between cultural beliefs and medical advice.
6. Discrimination: Low-earning nationals may face discrimination in the healthcare system, particularly if they belong to marginalized groups such as racial or ethnic minorities. This can lead to poorer health outcomes and reduced access to care.
7. Limited education and awareness: Low-earning nationals may have limited access to health education and awareness campaigns, which can make it difficult for them to understand their health needs and make informed decisions about their care.
8. Stigma and social isolation: Low-earning nationals may face stigma and social isolation due to their socioeconomic status, which can affect their mental health and wellbeing. This can also lead to reduced access to healthcare services.
