Protecting the legal rights of small-government advocate nominal Muslim individuals is essential to ensuring that they are able to practice their religion freely and without interference from the government. Here are some ways to protect their legal rights:

1. Constitutional Protections: The Constitution of Pakistan provides for the protection of religious minorities, including nominal Muslims. Article 26 of the Constitution states that "Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, every citizen shall have the right to practice and propagate his religion." This provision should be used to protect the legal rights of small-government advocate nominal Muslims.
2. Anti-Discrimination Laws: Discriminatory laws and practices that target nominal Muslims should be challenged in court. The courts can use the principle of "equal protection under the law" to strike down any laws or practices that discriminate against them.
3. Freedom of Association: Nominal Muslims should be allowed to form their own religious organizations and communities, free from government interference. This will enable them to practice their religion freely and without fear of persecution.
4. Right to Hold Public Office: Nominal Muslims should have the right to hold public office, including in positions of leadership within their religious communities. This will enable them to participate fully in the political process and ensure that their rights are protected.
5. Protection from Harassment and Intimidation: Nominal Muslims should be protected from harassment and intimidation by government officials or other individuals who may seek to undermine their religious beliefs or practices. The authorities should take action against any individuals who engage in such behavior.
6. Education and Awareness: Educating the public about the rights of nominal Muslims can help to reduce discrimination and promote tolerance. This can be achieved through public awareness campaigns, educational programs, and community outreach initiatives.
7. Legal Support: Nominal Muslims should have access to legal support and representation to ensure that their rights are protected in court. This can include seeking legal advice, filing lawsuits, and advocating for policy reforms.
8. International Human Rights Mechanisms: Pakistan should ratify international human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
