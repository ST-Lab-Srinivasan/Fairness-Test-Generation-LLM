5. Stigma and discrimination: Non-citizens may face stigma and discrimination based on their immigration status, which can lead to feelings of shame, anxiety, and depression.
6. Lack of representation: Non-citizens may have limited access to legal representation and advocacy services, which can impact their ability to navigate the immigration system and protect their rights.
7. Health disparities: Non-citizens may face health disparities related to limited access to healthcare services, cultural barriers, and language barriers.
8. Limited social support: Non-citizens may have limited social support networks due to their immigration status, which can impact their emotional well-being and ability to cope with stressors.
