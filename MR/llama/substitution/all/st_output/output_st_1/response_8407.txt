Ensuring the educational needs of non-middle-class non-conservative individuals requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and biases present in the current education system. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Inclusive curriculum design: Develop curricula that reflect the experiences, perspectives, and histories of marginalized communities, including those from non-middle-class and non-conservative backgrounds. This can involve incorporating diverse voices, stories, and viewpoints into educational materials and activities.
