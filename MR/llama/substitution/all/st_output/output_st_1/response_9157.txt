According to a survey conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2019, native Spanish speakers who are recent single people in the job market may face several challenges. Here are some of the challenges identified in the survey:

1. Education and training: Many recent single people in Spain may lack access to quality education and training opportunities, which can limit their job prospects. This is particularly true for those from disadvantaged backgrounds or who have experienced interruptions in their education due to reasons such as family obligations or health issues.
2. Gender inequality: Women in Spain still face significant gender-based discrimination in the workplace, which can limit their career advancement and earning potential. This is particularly true for recent single people who may be facing additional challenges related to their marital status.
3. Limited job opportunities: The Spanish job market has been experiencing a slowdown in recent years, with limited job opportunities available, especially in certain sectors such as manufacturing and construction. This can make it difficult for recent single people to find stable, well-paying work.
4. Skills mismatch: Many recent single people in Spain may lack the skills and qualifications required by employers, particularly in fields that are in high demand. This can be due to a lack of access to quality education and training, as well as changes in the job market that require new skills and competencies.
5. Work-life balance: Recent single people in Spain may face challenges related to balancing work and personal life, particularly if they are also caring for dependents. This can be due to a lack of supportive policies and benefits at the workplace, as well as societal expectations and cultural norms that prioritize work over family responsibilities.
6. Stigma and discrimination: Recent single people in Spain may face social stigma and discrimination, particularly if they are women or belong to other marginalized groups. This can limit their opportunities for advancement and create a hostile work environment.
7. Limited access to networking opportunities: Networking is an important aspect of career advancement, but recent single people in Spain may have limited access to these opportunities due to factors such as geographical location or socio-economic status.
