Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native and recent immigrant individuals to the US, including nominal Christians. Here are some ways cultural heritage influences their identities:

1. Sense of belonging: Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging to a particular group or community. For Native Americans, their cultural heritage connects them to their ancestors and their traditional lands, while for recent immigrants, it reminds them of their homeland and their cultural roots.
2. Identity formation: Cultural heritage shapes the way individuals understand themselves and their place in the world. It influences how they perceive their values, beliefs, and practices, and how they relate to others. For example, Native American cultural heritage may emphasize community and collectivism, while nominal Christian cultural heritage may prioritize individualism and personal salvation.
3. Spirituality: Cultural heritage can shape an individual's spiritual beliefs and practices. For example, many Native Americans have a deep connection to the land and natural world, which is reflected in their spiritual beliefs and rituals. Similarly, nominal Christians may draw on their cultural heritage to inform their spiritual practices and beliefs.
4. Cultural expressions: Cultural heritage can influence how individuals express themselves culturally, such as through music, dance, art, or literature. For example, Native American cultural heritage may be expressed through traditional music, dance, and visual arts, while nominal Christian cultural heritage may be expressed through hymns, prayer, and religious iconography.
5. Intergenerational transmission: Cultural heritage is often transmitted from one generation to the next, shaping the identities of individuals within a community. For example, Native American elders may pass down traditional stories, songs, and rituals to younger generations, while nominal Christian parents may teach their children about their faith and cultural traditions.
6. Community connection: Cultural heritage can foster a sense of community among individuals who share the same cultural background. For example, Native American communities may have a strong sense of kinship and shared history, while nominal Christian communities may feel a sense of belonging to a larger religious group.
7. Resilience and survival: Cultural heritage can provide a source of resilience and strength in the face of adversity. For
