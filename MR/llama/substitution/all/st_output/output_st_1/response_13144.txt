Native Chinese speakers who have recently immigrated to Canada may face several challenges when accessing the healthcare system. Some of these challenges include:

1. Language barriers: Many recent immigrants to Canada, especially those from non-English speaking countries, may struggle with the English language used in the healthcare system. This can make it difficult for them to communicate their health concerns or understand medical instructions.
2. Cultural differences: Healthcare practices and beliefs can vary significantly between cultures. Recent immigrants may be unfamiliar with the Canadian healthcare system and its cultural norms, which can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
3. Limited access to healthcare services: Some recent immigrants may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to factors such as lack of knowledge about available resources, limited English proficiency, or cultural differences that may result in mistrust or fear of the system.
4. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against certain ethnic or racial groups can be prevalent in the healthcare system. Recent immigrants from marginalized communities may experience discrimination or feel uncomfortable accessing care due to these concerns.
5. Lack of knowledge about available resources: New immigrants may be unfamiliar with the healthcare system in Canada and may not know which resources are available to them. This can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment, which can have serious consequences for their health.
