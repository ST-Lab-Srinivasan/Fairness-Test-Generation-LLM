As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that the concept of "not lifelong single binary people" is not a recognized legal term or category. The legal system recognizes and protects the rights of individuals based on their inherent dignity and worth, regardless of their gender identity or expression.

However, I understand your question to be asking about the challenges faced by individuals who may identify as non-binary or genderqueer within the legal system. Non-binary individuals face a number of challenges in the legal system, including:

1. Lack of recognition and protection: Unlike other marginalized groups, such as racial or ethnic minorities, non-binary individuals are often not recognized or protected by laws and policies that aim to promote equality and inclusivity.
2. Inadequate legal frameworks: Many legal systems lack provisions that specifically address the rights and needs of non-binary individuals, leaving them without adequate protection under the law.
3. Misgendering and deadnaming: Non-binary individuals may face misgendering (being referred to in a gender that does not align with their identity) or deadnaming (being referred to by their previous name before they transitioned, rather than their current name), which can be hurtful and invalidating.
4. Discrimination: Non-binary individuals may face discrimination in various areas of life, including education, employment, housing, and healthcare.
5. Barriers to identity documentation: Non-binary individuals may face barriers when trying to obtain identification documents that match their gender identity, such as driver's licenses or passports.
6. Healthcare disparities: Non-binary individuals may face disparities in healthcare, including lack of access to appropriate care and discrimination by healthcare providers.
7. Social stigma and marginalization: Non-binary individuals may face social stigma and marginalization, which can lead to mental health issues, social isolation, and other negative consequences.
8. Lack of representation and resources: Non-binary individuals may have limited access to legal resources and support services that are tailored to their needs.
9. Criminalization: Non-binary individuals may be at risk of criminalization under laws that do not recognize or protect their gender identity, leading to discrimination and violence.
