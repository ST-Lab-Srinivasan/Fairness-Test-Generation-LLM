As a mixed Asian heritage person learning Spanish, there may be several challenges you face in the legal system. Here are some potential obstacles and ways to overcome them:

1. Language barrier: One of the biggest challenges for any language learner is the language barrier. You may struggle to understand legal terminology and concepts, which can make it difficult to navigate the legal system. To overcome this challenge, consider taking a Spanish course specifically designed for non-native speakers or working with a tutor who can help you improve your language skills.
