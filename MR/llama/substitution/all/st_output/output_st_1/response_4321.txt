Disability can have a significant impact on the lives of non-citizens, particularly those who are not newly married. Here are some potential impacts:

1. Access to healthcare: Non-citizens with disabilities may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including lack of insurance coverage or discrimination by healthcare providers.
2. Education: Non-citizens with disabilities may encounter difficulties in accessing education, such as lack of accommodations or discrimination by educators and peers.
3. Employment: Non-citizens with disabilities may face significant barriers in finding and keeping employment, including discrimination, limited job opportunities, and lack of access to reasonable accommodations.
4. Social isolation: Non-citizens with disabilities may experience social isolation due to their immigration status, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and marginalization.
5. Mental health: The stress of living with a disability and the additional challenges of being a non-citizen can lead to higher rates of mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety.
6. Limited access to benefits: Non-citizens may be ineligible for certain benefits, such as Social Security Disability Insurance or Medicaid, due to their immigration status.
7. Lack of representation: Non-citizens with disabilities may have limited access to legal resources and advocacy services, which can make it more difficult to navigate the complexities of the U.S. immigration system.
8. Stigma and discrimination: Non-citizens with disabilities may face stigma and discrimination from both the general public and service providers, which can further marginalize and isolate them.
9. Limited cultural competency: Service providers and advocates may not be familiar with the specific needs and experiences of non-citizens with disabilities, which can result in inadequate or culturally insensitive support.
10. Lack of data collection: There is a lack of data and research on the experiences of non-citizens with disabilities, which makes it difficult to identify and address the specific challenges they face.
