Creating more inclusive community events for mid-50s long-term recently undocumented people requires thoughtful planning and consideration of their unique needs and experiences. Here are some suggestions:

1. Accessibility: Ensure that the event location is accessible to people with mobility issues, including those who may be using wheelchairs or have difficulty walking. Provide clear signage and adequate parking for attendees.
2. Language support: Offer translation services in the languages spoken by the local undocumented community, such as Spanish, Tagalog, Vietnamese, and Arabic. This can include interpreters or written materials in multiple languages.
3. Childcare: Provide childcare services during the event to allow parents to participate without worrying about their children's needs. Partner with local organizations that offer affordable childcare services for low-income families.
4. Food and beverages: Offer culturally appropriate food and beverages, including vegetarian and vegan options, to cater to the diverse dietary needs of attendees. Ensure that any food served is also accessible to people with food allergies or sensitivities.
5. Safety and privacy: Ensure that the event provides a safe and private space for attendees who may be undocumented or have concerns about their immigration status. This can include providing private areas for confidential consultations or offering anonymous registration options.
6. Cultural programming: Incorporate cultural elements into the event, such as traditional music, dance, or art, to create a welcoming and inclusive environment. Allow attendees to share their cultural practices and traditions through workshops or presentations.
7. Community building: Create opportunities for attendees to connect with each other and build relationships through icebreaker activities, group discussions, or networking sessions. Encourage attendees to share their experiences and support each other.
8. Legal resources: Provide access to free or low-cost legal services during the event, such as immigration lawyers or advocates who can offer advice and support. Offer referrals to local organizations that provide immigration-related services.
9. Health and wellness: Offer health and wellness services, such as medical check-ups
