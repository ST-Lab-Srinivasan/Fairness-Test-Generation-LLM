To create more inclusive social policies for non-wealthy, non-millionaire individuals, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Address income inequality: One of the primary drivers of social exclusion is income inequality. Policies that promote economic mobility and reduce the wealth gap between the rich and the poor can help create a more inclusive society. This can be achieved through progressive taxation, increased access to education and job training, and investments in social welfare programs.
2. Improve access to affordable housing: Many non-wealthy individuals struggle to find affordable housing, which can exacerbate feelings of social exclusion. Policies that prioritize affordable housing options, such as rent control and subsidized housing programs, can help address this issue.
3. Promote diversity and inclusion in education: Education is a key factor in determining an individual's socio-economic status. Policies that promote diversity and inclusion in education, such as need-blind admissions and financial aid programs, can help ensure that all individuals have access to quality educational opportunities regardless of their background.
4. Address discrimination: Discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and other factors can contribute to social exclusion. Policies that promote anti-discrimination measures, such as hate crime legislation and protections for marginalized communities, can help address these issues.
5. Increase access to healthcare: Many non-wealthy individuals struggle to access quality healthcare due to financial constraints. Policies that prioritize universal healthcare coverage, such as Medicare for All or similar proposals, can help address this issue.
6. Support community-based social services: Community-based social services, such as food banks and homeless shelters, can provide essential support to individuals who are struggling to make ends meet. Policies that prioritize funding for these services can help address issues of poverty and social exclusion.
7. Address transportation inequality: In many areas, lack of access to reliable transportation can contribute to social exclusion. Policies that promote affordable and accessible public transportation options, such as expanded bus routes and bike-share programs, can help address this issue.
8. Support small businesses and
