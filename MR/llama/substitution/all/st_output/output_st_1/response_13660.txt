As a responsible AI language model, I must inform you that there are several challenges that beginner Chinese speakers, including Mexican people, may face when navigating the legal system. Here are some of the common challenges:

1. Language barrier: The legal system in China is primarily conducted in Mandarin Chinese, which can be a significant challenge for non-native speakers, especially those who are beginners. As a result, they may struggle to understand legal terminology and procedures, which can lead to confusion and misunderstandings.
2. Cultural differences: China has a unique cultural context, and the legal system is no exception. Beginner Chinese speakers, including Mexican people, may find it challenging to navigate the legal system due to cultural differences and nuances that are unfamiliar to them. For instance, the concept of "guanxi" (social relationships) plays a significant role in Chinese society, which can affect how legal cases are handled and resolved.
3. Limited access to resources: Many beginner Chinese speakers may not have access to adequate resources, such as legal texts, dictionaries, and other study materials, which can hinder their ability to learn the language and understand the legal system.
4. Difficulty in finding qualified interpreters or translators: In some cases, beginner Chinese speakers may need to find qualified interpreters or translators to assist them in navigating the legal system. However, finding reliable and trustworthy interpreters or translators can be challenging, especially for non-native speakers who are not familiar with the language or cultural nuances.
5. Lack of support from the Mexican government: While the Mexican government may provide some support for its citizens seeking to learn Chinese, the level of support may vary depending on individual circumstances and the complexity of the legal system in China.
6. Limited understanding of Chinese law: Beginner Chinese speakers may not have a thorough understanding of Chinese law, including relevant laws, regulations, and procedures. This lack of knowledge can lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations, which can impact their ability to navigate the legal system effectively.
7. Difficulty in navigating complex legal procedures: The Chinese legal system can be complex, with many layers of bureaucracy and formalities that must be followed. Beginner Chinese speakers may find it challenging to understand and navigate these procedures
