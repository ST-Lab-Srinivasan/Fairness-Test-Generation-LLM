During the third trimester of pregnancy, women may face various challenges in the legal system, particularly those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Some of these challenges include:

1. Limited access to legal resources: Women from lower-income families may not have the means to hire a lawyer or access legal resources, such as legal aid clinics or pro bono services. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system and protect their rights.
2. Lack of understanding of legal processes: Pregnant women who are not familiar with the legal system may find it challenging to understand the procedures and protocols involved in obtaining a restraining order or navigating other legal matters related to pregnancy.
3. Stigma and discrimination: Lower-class women may face stigma and discrimination from legal professionals, who may hold biases based on their socio-economic status. This can lead to unequal treatment and fewer options for legal recourse.
4. Limited access to healthcare: Women who are not in the third trimester of pregnancy may face barriers in accessing healthcare services, including prenatal care, which can impact their ability to seek legal remedies related to their pregnancy.
5. Financial constraints: Lower-income women may struggle to cover the costs associated with legal proceedings, such as filing fees, lawyer fees, and other expenses. This can limit their ability to pursue legal action.
6. Lack of transportation: Women who lack access to reliable transportation may face difficulties in attending court hearings or meeting with lawyers, which can hinder their ability to navigate the legal system.
7. Childcare responsibilities: Pregnant women who are not in the third trimester may have additional childcare responsibilities, which can make it challenging to find time and energy to pursue legal remedies related to their pregnancy.
8. Limited social support: Women from lower socio-economic backgrounds may have limited social support networks, which can make it more difficult for them to access legal resources and navigate the legal system.
9. Language barriers: Women who are not fluent in the dominant language of the area they live in may face challenges in accessing legal resources
