Political affiliation can have a significant impact on the lives of native English speakers, particularly for those who are advanced in age (over 85). Here are some potential impacts:

1. Healthcare access and quality: Depending on the political affiliation of the individual, they may have better or worse access to healthcare services, which can affect their overall health and well-being.
