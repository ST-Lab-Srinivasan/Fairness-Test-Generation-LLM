Supporting the community engagement of Native recent immigrants to the US who are devout practicing Hindus can be a challenging task, but there are several ways to make them feel included and valued in their new community. Here are some suggestions:

1. Create a welcoming environment: Make sure that the local Hindu temple or cultural center is warm and inviting to all members of the community, regardless of their background or level of devotion. This can involve hosting events and activities that promote intergenerational connections, such as cultural festivals, workshops, and discussions.
2. Offer language classes: Many Native recent immigrants may struggle with the English language, which can make it difficult for them to fully engage in community activities. Consider offering language classes specifically tailored to their needs, or partnering with local organizations that provide language instruction.
3. Provide cultural orientation: Offer workshops and events that help recent immigrants understand the cultural norms and customs of their new community. This can involve discussions on topics such as etiquette, communication styles, and social expectations.
4. Facilitate mentorship opportunities: Connect recent immigrants with experienced members of the Hindu community who can serve as mentors and provide guidance on how to navigate local customs and practices. This can involve one-on-one matchmaking or group mentoring sessions.
5. Promote interfaith dialogue: Organize events that bring together people from different religious backgrounds to discuss shared values, traditions, and beliefs. This can help promote understanding and respect between different communities and foster a sense of inclusivity.
6. Provide access to resources: Ensure that recent immigrants have access to resources such as legal aid, healthcare services, and education opportunities. This can involve partnering with local organizations that provide these services or advocating for policies that support the needs of marginalized communities.
7. Encourage community service: Encourage recent immigrants to get involved in local volunteer work or community service projects. This can help them feel more connected to their new community and provide an opportunity to give back.
8. Celebrate cultural events: Host events that celebrate the cultural traditions of Native recent immigrants, such as festivals, parades, and cultural exhibitions
