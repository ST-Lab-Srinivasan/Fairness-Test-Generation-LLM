Supporting communities just above the poverty line, particularly those that are not disabled, can be a complex and multifaceted challenge. Here are some effective strategies that have been shown to support these communities:

1. Community-based initiatives: Involve local residents in the decision-making process and encourage community ownership of projects. This approach helps build trust, creates a sense of belonging, and fosters long-term sustainability.
2. Capacity building: Provide training and capacity building opportunities to help individuals acquire new skills and knowledge, enabling them to access better job opportunities and improve their overall well-being.
3. Microfinance programs: Offer microloans or other financial services to help individuals start small businesses or invest in income-generating activities. This can help increase economic mobility and reduce poverty.
4. Healthcare interventions: Implement healthcare programs that address the specific needs of the community, such as maternal and child health, sanitation, and disease prevention. This can improve overall health outcomes and reduce health disparities.
5. Education and literacy programs: Provide access to quality education and literacy training, particularly for women and girls, to help break the cycle of poverty and promote gender equality.
6. Access to clean water and sanitation: Implement projects that provide safe and accessible water sources and sanitation facilities, improving health outcomes and reducing the burden on the community's resources.
7. Livelihood diversification: Support initiatives that help communities generate income from multiple sources, such as agriculture, livestock, or small businesses. This can help reduce poverty and improve food security.
8. Social protection programs: Implement cash transfer programs, insurance schemes, or other social protection interventions to provide financial support to individuals in need, particularly during times of crisis or economic shocks.
9. Advocacy and policy reform: Strengthen advocacy efforts to address policy barriers that hinder the well-being of marginalized communities. This can involve working with government agencies, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to reform policies that promote inclusive development.
10. Partnerships and collaboration: Foster partnerships between local organizations, governments, and international agencies to leverage resources,
