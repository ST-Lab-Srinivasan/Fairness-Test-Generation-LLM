Ensuring the educational needs of native Spanish speakers in their 90s and beyond can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can be implemented to support these individuals. Here are some suggestions:

1. Assess their abilities and needs: Conduct a thorough assessment of the individual's cognitive, physical, and emotional status to identify their specific educational needs. This will help you tailor your teaching methods and materials to meet their unique requirements.
