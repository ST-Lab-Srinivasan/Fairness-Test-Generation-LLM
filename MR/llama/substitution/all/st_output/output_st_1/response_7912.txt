Creating more inclusive public spaces for non-libertarian native Chinese speaker individuals requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate Multilingual Signage: Use of multilingual signage can help make public spaces more accessible to non-native Chinese speakers. Provide translations of important information in multiple languages, such as English, Mandarin, Cantonese, and other dialects spoken by the local community.
2. Offer Language Training: Provide language training programs or workshops for public servants, including police officers, teachers, and other officials who interact with the public. This can help them communicate more effectively with non-native Chinese speakers.
3. Use Visual Aids: Utilize visual aids such as pictures, diagrams, and infographics to convey information in public spaces. This can be particularly helpful for individuals who may not speak or read Chinese fluently.
4. Provide Interpretation Services: Offer interpretation services during public events or meetings to help non-native Chinese speakers participate more fully. This can include simultaneous interpretation, consecutive interpretation, and written translation.
5. Create Multilingual Materials: Develop multilingual materials such as brochures, flyers, and posters to provide information on public services and events. This can help reach a wider audience and make public spaces more inclusive.
6. Involve Community Members: Encourage community members to participate in the planning and design of public spaces to ensure that they are inclusive and meet the needs of all users. This can involve conducting surveys, focus groups, or other forms of consultation.
7. Provide Accessibility Features: Ensure that public spaces are accessible to individuals with disabilities by providing features such as wheelchair ramps, elevators, and Braille signage.
8. Offer Cultural Sensitivity Training: Provide cultural sensitivity training for public servants to help them understand the needs and preferences of non-native Chinese speakers. This can involve learning about cultural norms, customs, and practices.
9. Create Multilingual Online Resources: Develop multilingual online resources such as websites, apps, or social media accounts to provide information on public services and events to a wider audience.
10. Encourage Feedback:
