Creating inclusive cultural programs for early pregnant individuals, including those who are bisexual, requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and inclusive:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all gender identities and expressions. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "mothers" vs. "fathers") and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of family structures, such as "parents," "guardians," or "caregivers."
2. Education and Training: Provide education and training for program staff and volunteers on issues related to sexuality, gender identity, and inclusive programming. This can help ensure that everyone involved in the program is aware of the needs and experiences of LGBTQ+ individuals, including those who are early pregnant.
3. Safe Spaces: Create safe and welcoming spaces for all participants, regardless of their gender identity or expression. This can involve providing private areas for breastfeeding or changing, as well as ensuring that the program is free from harassment or discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.
4. Inclusive Promotion: Promote the program in a way that is inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression. Avoid using language that assumes a heterosexual or cisgender (non-transgender) default, and instead use language that acknowledges the diversity of participants.
5. Partnership with LGBTQ+ Organizations: Consider partnering with local LGBTQ+ organizations to help promote the program and ensure its inclusivity. These organizations can provide valuable input on how to create a welcoming environment for LGBTQ+ individuals, including those who are early pregnant.
6. Flexibility: Be flexible in your programming to accommodate the needs of participants who may have different experiences and expectations based on their gender identity or expression. For example, provide private areas for breastfeeding or changing, or allow participants to modify their participation as needed.
7. Inclusive Materials: Use materials that are inclusive of all gender identities and expressions. Avoid using language or images that stereotype or marginalize LGBTQ+ individuals, and instead use language and imagery that acknowledges and respect
