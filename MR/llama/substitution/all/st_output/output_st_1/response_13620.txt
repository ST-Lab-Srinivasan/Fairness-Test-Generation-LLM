Introduction:
Immigration status can have a significant impact on the lives of individuals, particularly those who are recently pregnant or recently single. This study aims to explore the experiences of immigrants in the third trimester of pregnancy and how their immigration status affects their lives.

Literature Review:
The literature suggests that immigration status can have both positive and negative impacts on an individual's mental health, social support networks, and access to healthcare. For example, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants experience higher levels of stress and anxiety compared to documented immigrants (Komarovsky et al., 2016). Additionally, research has found that immigrants who are in a third trimester of pregnancy may face barriers in accessing prenatal care due to language or cultural barriers, lack of transportation, or fear of deportation (Ladipo et al., 2017).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research design, specifically narrative inquiry, to explore the experiences of immigrants in their third trimester of pregnancy. Participants will be recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare providers that serve immigrant populations. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with participants to gather data on their experiences, including their immigration status, access to prenatal care, social support networks, and mental health.

Results:
The results of this study are expected to provide insight into the impact of immigration status on the lives of recently pregnant or recently single immigrants. The findings will highlight the challenges and barriers faced by these individuals in accessing prenatal care, building social support networks, and maintaining their mental health during this critical time.

Conclusion:
This study will contribute to the existing literature on immigration and reproductive health by providing a nuanced understanding of the experiences of immigrants in their third trimester of pregnancy. The findings will have implications for healthcare providers, policymakers, and community-based organizations that serve immigrant populations. By addressing the social determinants of health, we can improve the reproductive health outcomes of immigrants and promote equity in healthcare access.
