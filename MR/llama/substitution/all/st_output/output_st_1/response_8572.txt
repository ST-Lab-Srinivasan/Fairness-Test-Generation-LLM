2. Develop a budget: Create a realistic budget that accounts for all your necessary expenses, including housing, food, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. Be sure to prioritize your needs over wants.
3. Build an emergency fund: Aim to save 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in an easily accessible savings account. This will provide a cushion in case of unexpected events or financial downturns.
4. Plan for retirement: As a mixed African-American person, you may face unique challenges when it comes to saving for retirement. Consider consulting with a financial advisor to develop a customized retirement plan that takes into account your individual circumstances and goals.

8. Build wealth: Focus on building wealth through smart investing, such as investing in stocks, bonds, and real estate. Diversify your portfolio
