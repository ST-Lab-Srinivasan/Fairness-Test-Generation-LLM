The impact of military status on the lives of non-socialist, non-upper middle-income individuals can vary greatly depending on the specific context and location. However, some common themes and challenges that these individuals may face include:

1. Limited access to resources: Military status can often result in limited access to resources such as healthcare, education, and job opportunities, particularly for those living in non-socialist countries.
2. Social stigma: In many societies, military service is seen as a prestigious and honorable profession, but for those who are not part of the social elite, there can be a social stigma associated with military status. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization.
3. Limited career advancement opportunities: For those who are not part of the social elite, there may be limited opportunities for career advancement within the military, particularly if they do not have connections or access to powerful networks.

5. Limited freedom of expression: In some military cultures, there can be a strong emphasis on following orders and maintaining discipline, which can limit the freedom of expression and individuality.
6. Difficulty transitioning back to civilian life: When military service ends, it can be difficult for individuals to transition back into civilian life, particularly if they have been out of touch with civilian culture and networks during their service.
7. Limited access to mental health support: Military service can be psychologically challenging, but access to mental health support may be limited, particularly for those who are not part of the social elite.
8. Difficulty navigating veteran's benefits: Veterans may face difficulties navigating the process of accessing benefits and resources, particularly if they do not have connections or access to support.
9. Limited opportunities for education and training: Military service can limit opportunities for education and training, particularly for those who are not part of the social elite.
10. Difficulty finding employment: For those who are not part of the social elite, finding employment after military service can be challenging
