Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of ethnically full Asian devout Christians. For many Asian individuals, their cultural heritage is deeply intertwined with their faith, and their religious identity is informed by their cultural background. Here are some ways cultural heritage shapes the identities of ethnically full Asian devout Christians:
