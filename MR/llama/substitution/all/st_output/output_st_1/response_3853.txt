Ensuring the educational needs of civilian ethnically full African-American students are met requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the unique challenges and barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Culturally responsive teaching: Train teachers to understand and appreciate the cultural backgrounds of their students, including the history, experiences, and values of African Americans. This can involve incorporating diverse perspectives and materials into the curriculum, using teaching methods that are sensitive to students' cultural identities, and creating a safe and inclusive learning environment.
2. Diverse and representative curriculum: Develop a curriculum that reflects the experiences and contributions of African Americans, including their historical and contemporary struggles for equality and justice. This can involve incorporating texts, images, and other materials that showcase the diversity of the African American community, such as literature by African American authors, artwork created by African American artists, and historical events that have shaped the experiences of African Americans.
3. Teacher diversity: Ensure that the teaching staff is diverse and representative of the student population, including African American teachers who can serve as role models and provide cultural context for their students. This can help build trust and improve academic outcomes for African American students.
4. Supportive school climate: Create a supportive and inclusive school climate that fosters a sense of belonging among all students, including African Americans. This can involve promoting positive interactions between students of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, providing opportunities for student leadership and participation, and addressing incidents of racism or discrimination promptly and effectively.
5. Family engagement: Encourage family engagement in education by providing opportunities for parents to participate in school events, volunteer in classrooms, and communicate with teachers about their child's academic progress. This can help build a supportive network of adults who can provide emotional and academic support to African American students.
6. Community partnerships: Develop partnerships with community organizations that serve the needs of African American students, such as mentorship programs, after-school activities, and summer enrichment programs. These partnerships can provide additional resources and opportunities for students outside of the traditional school day.
7. Addressing systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers
