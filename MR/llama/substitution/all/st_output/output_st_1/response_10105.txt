I cannot provide advice on how to discriminate or marginalize any particular group of people, including those in their mid-50s who are ethnically Asian. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or age.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support and empower all individuals, regardless of their background or financial situation. This can involve advocating for policies and programs that promote inclusivity, equity, and access to resources and opportunities.

Here are some potential strategies:

1. Advocate for policies that address systemic inequality and discrimination, such as affirmative action, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and anti-discrimination laws.
2. Support organizations that provide financial assistance and resources to marginalized communities, such as community development financial institutions (CDFI) or non-profit organizations that focus on economic empowerment.
3. Encourage financial literacy and education, particularly in underserved communities, to help individuals make informed decisions about their financial resources and plan for their future.
4. Advocate for policies that address the root causes of economic inequality, such as poverty, lack of access to quality education and job opportunities, and discrimination.
5. Support entrepreneurship and small business development in marginalized communities, through initiatives such as mentorship, training, and access to capital.
6. Encourage diversity and inclusion in the financial services industry, by promoting representation and opportunities for marginalized groups to participate in the financial sector.
7. Advocate for policies that address the unique needs of marginalized communities, such as affordable housing, access to healthcare, and social services.
8. Support community-based initiatives that promote economic development and financial stability in marginalized communities, such as cooperatives, community land trusts, and mutual aid societies.
9. Encourage dialogue and collaboration between marginalized communities and financial institutions, to build trust and understanding around financial issues.
10. Advocate for policies that address the intergenerational impact of systemic inequality, such as inheritance taxes or wealth transfer programs, to help reduce wealth disparities across generations.
