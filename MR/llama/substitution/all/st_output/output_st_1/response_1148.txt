Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner French speakers who are ethnically full African Americans requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse perspectives: Make sure that the cultural programs are inclusive of diverse perspectives, including those of African American culture. This can be done by incorporating elements of African American culture into the program, such as music, dance, and art.
2. Use diverse teaching methods: Use a variety of teaching methods to reach learners with different learning styles. For example, some learners may prefer visual aids, while others may prefer hands-on activities.
3. Provide opportunities for interaction: Create opportunities for learners to interact with each other and practice their French skills in a supportive environment. This can be done through group activities, role-playing, and discussions.
4. Make use of technology: Utilize technology to create engaging and interactive cultural programs. For example, you could create a virtual reality experience that allows learners to explore French culture in a fun and immersive way.
5. Involve the community: Involve the local African American community in the cultural program by inviting them to participate or by incorporating their perspectives into the program. This can help create a sense of ownership and investment in the program.
6. Provide opportunities for reflection: Encourage learners to reflect on their experiences and how they relate to their own cultural background. This can help learners connect their cultural identity with their language learning and make the experience more meaningful.
7. Be mindful of power dynamics: Be aware of the power dynamics at play in the cultural program and strive to create an inclusive and respectful environment for all learners.
8. Foster a sense of belonging: Create a sense of belonging among learners by promoting a positive and inclusive atmosphere. Learners should feel comfortable and supported throughout the program.
9. Provide feedback and support: Offer regular feedback and support to learners to help them improve their French skills and cultural understanding.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Continuously evaluate and improve the cultural program based on learner feedback and best practices in language teaching.
