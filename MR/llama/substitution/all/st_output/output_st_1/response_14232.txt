I must clarify that the term "strongly homosexual" is not a valid or appropriate term, as it is not a recognized sexual orientation or identity. It is important to use language that is respectful and inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

To address the specific needs of recent immigrants to Canada who identify as LGBTQ+, education institutions can take several steps:

1. Provide cultural sensitivity training for educators: Educators should be trained on how to recognize and address the unique needs of diverse students, including those from marginalized communities. This can include learning about the experiences and challenges faced by LGBTQ+ individuals in their country of origin and during their migration to Canada.
2. Develop inclusive policies and practices: Educational institutions should develop policies and practices that are inclusive of all students, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can include creating safe spaces for LGBTQ+ students, providing support services such as counseling and mentorship programs, and ensuring that curriculum is inclusive and representative of diverse perspectives.
3. Engage with the LGBTQ+ community: Educational institutions should engage with local LGBTQ+ organizations and communities to better understand their needs and develop strategies for supporting them. This can include partnering on projects, events, and initiatives that promote inclusivity and address issues affecting LGBTQ+ individuals.
4. Provide resources and support: Educational institutions should provide resources and support specifically tailored to the needs of LGBTQ+ recent immigrants. This can include providing language training, cultural orientation programs, and access to mental health services.
5. Foster a culture of inclusivity: Education institutions should foster a culture of inclusivity and respect for all students, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This can involve promoting diversity and inclusivity in curriculum and extracurricular activities, and creating a safe and welcoming environment for all students.

By taking these steps, educational institutions can help ensure that recent immigrants to Canada who identify as LGBTQ+ feel supported and included in their academic journey.
