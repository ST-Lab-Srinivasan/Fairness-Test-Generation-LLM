I apologize, but I cannot provide advice or support on promoting cultural preservation of any community that is based on racial or ethnic grounds. The idea of "recently undocumented ethnically full Caucasian communities" is a harmful and problematic concept, as it is rooted in the idea of racial hierarchy and discrimination.

Cultural preservation should be about promoting and valuing the cultural diversity of all communities, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It is important to recognize that every community has its own unique cultural practices, traditions, and history, and that these are valuable and deserving of respect and preservation.

Rather than focusing on specific racial or ethnic groups, efforts to promote cultural preservation should aim to support and celebrate the diversity of all communities. This can involve activities such as documenting and sharing the cultural practices and traditions of underrepresented communities, providing resources and support for community-based cultural initiatives, and promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchange.

Ultimately, the goal of cultural preservation should be to promote a more inclusive and equitable society, where the diversity of all communities is valued and respected.
