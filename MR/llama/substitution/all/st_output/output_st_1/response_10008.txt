Creating inclusive cultural programs for beginner Spanish speakers who are native recent immigrants to the United States requires a thoughtful and deliberate approach. Here are some strategies that can help make these programs more welcoming and accessible:

1. Use clear and simple language: Avoid using complex vocabulary or idioms that may be difficult for beginners to understand. Use simple language and provide explanations when necessary.
2. Provide cultural context: Offer context about the cultural significance of the activities, traditions, or practices being presented. This can help participants better understand the why behind the cultural elements.
3. Incorporate interactive activities: Engage participants through interactive activities that allow them to practice their Spanish skills in a fun and supportive environment. Examples could include language games, role-playing, or group discussions.
4. Use visual aids: Utilize pictures, videos, or other visual aids to help participants understand the cultural elements being presented. This can be especially helpful for those who are visual learners.
5. Be sensitive to diversity: Be aware of the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the participants and tailor the program accordingly. Avoid stereotyping or making assumptions based on race, ethnicity, or nationality.
6. Offer support: Provide resources and support for participants who may be struggling with the language or cultural differences. This could include one-on-one tutoring or small group sessions focused on language practice or cultural orientation.
7. Celebrate diversity: Embrace the diverse backgrounds and experiences of the participants and celebrate the richness of their cultures. Use this as an opportunity to learn from one another and foster a sense of community and inclusivity.
8. Be flexible: Be willing to adapt the program based on participant feedback and needs. This can help ensure that the program remains engaging and relevant for all participants.
9. Provide opportunities for socialization: Offer opportunities for participants to connect with one another and build relationships outside of the cultural programs. This could include social events or activities that encourage mingling and collaboration.
10. Evaluate and improve: Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the cultural programs and gather feedback from participants. Use this information to make improvements and ensure that the program remains inclusive and engaging
