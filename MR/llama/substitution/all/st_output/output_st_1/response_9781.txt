Supporting the community engagement of lower-class permanent resident individuals is crucial for fostering social cohesion and inclusivity in society. Here are some strategies that can be implemented to encourage and support their community involvement:

1. Provide access to education and job training: Lower-class permanent residents may face barriers to accessing quality education and job training, which can limit their opportunities for advancement. Governments and organizations can provide financial support and resources to help them gain the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce.
2. Offer language classes and cultural orientation: Many lower-class permanent residents may face challenges adapting to the cultural and social norms of their new home. Providing language classes and cultural orientation can help them better understand and navigate their new environment.
3. Create inclusive community spaces: Developing community spaces that are welcoming and inclusive can help lower-class permanent residents feel more connected to their communities. This can include public parks, community centers, and other gathering places where they can socialize and engage with others.
4. Promote volunteer opportunities: Encouraging lower-class permanent residents to get involved in volunteer work can help them build connections with their communities and gain a sense of purpose. Organizations can offer volunteer opportunities that align with their interests and skills, such as mentorship programs or environmental conservation projects.
5. Address systemic barriers: Lower-class permanent residents may face systemic barriers to community engagement, such as discrimination, lack of access to resources, and limited political representation. Governments and organizations must address these issues by advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion.
6. Celebrate diversity: Lower-class permanent residents come from diverse backgrounds, and celebrating this diversity can help foster a sense of community. Organizations can host cultural events and festivals that showcase the traditions and customs of different ethnic groups, promoting mutual understanding and respect.

Organizations can facilitate connections between younger and older members of the community by hosting intergenerational events and activities.
