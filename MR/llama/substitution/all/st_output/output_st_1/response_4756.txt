As a not just above poverty line immigrant natural-born US citizen, I have faced several challenges in the US healthcare system. Here are some of the challenges that I have encountered:

1. Language barriers: As an immigrant, I face language barriers when communicating with healthcare providers. Many hospitals and clinics do not have interpreters or translators available, which can make it difficult for me to understand my medical conditions, treatment options, and billing information.
2. Lack of cultural sensitivity: The US healthcare system is not always sensitive to the cultural beliefs and practices of immigrant communities. For example, some healthcare providers may not be aware of traditional healing practices or religious restrictions on medical treatment.
3. Limited access to specialized care: As an immigrant, I may face barriers when trying to access specialized medical care. For example, I may have difficulty finding a specialist who speaks my native language or understands my cultural beliefs and practices.
4. High out-of-pocket costs: Many immigrants face high out-of-pocket costs for medical care, including co-pays, deductibles, and copays. This can be a significant burden, especially for those who are not eligible for financial assistance programs.
5. Complexity of the healthcare system: The US healthcare system is complex and can be difficult to navigate, even for those who are fluent in English. I have found it challenging to understand my insurance coverage, how to access care, and how to appeal denials of coverage.
6. Discrimination and bias: Unfortunately, discrimination and bias against immigrants still exist in the US healthcare system. I have encountered instances where healthcare providers have made assumptions about me based on my race, ethnicity, or immigration status.
7. Lack of trust: Building trust with healthcare providers can be challenging for immigrants, particularly if we have had negative experiences in the past. It is important to find healthcare providers who are culturally competent and willing to listen to our concerns.
8. Difficulty accessing mental health care: Mental health care can be especially challenging for immigrants, as there may be language barriers
