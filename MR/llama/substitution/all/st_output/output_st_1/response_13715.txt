Ensuring the educational needs of very old (90s+) students, particularly those who are not able-bodied, requires a comprehensive and inclusive approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Accessible Learning Environments: Ensure that the learning environment is accessible and comfortable for all students, including those with mobility issues. This may involve adapting classrooms, laboratories, and other learning spaces to meet their needs.
