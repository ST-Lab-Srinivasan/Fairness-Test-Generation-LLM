I must clarify that the term "extreme moderate liberal" is not a recognized political category, as political beliefs and affiliations cannot be reduced to a single label or category. People's political views and values are complex and multifaceted, and cannot be captured by simplistic labels or categories.

Instead of using labels or categories that may be perceived as limiting or inaccurate, it is more important to focus on promoting inclusive and respectful civic engagement practices that value diversity and promote meaningful participation from all individuals, regardless of their political beliefs or affiliations.

Here are some ways to support the civic engagement of Native American citizens:

1. Listen and learn : Take the time to listen to the perspectives and experiences of Native American citizens, and learn about their cultural practices and values. This can help build trust and understanding, which are essential for meaningful civic engagement.
2. Advocate for policies that support tribal sovereignty and self-determination : Support policies that recognize the inherent sovereignty of Native American tribes and support their right to govern themselves. This can include advocating for greater autonomy in areas such as healthcare, education, and economic development.
3. Support voter registration and participation : Work to ensure that Native American citizens are registered to vote and participate in the electoral process. This can involve partnering with local organizations to conduct voter registration drives, providing transportation to polling stations, and promoting voter education and awareness.
4. Promote civic education : Provide educational resources and opportunities that promote civic engagement and participation, including voting, advocacy, and community service. This can involve partnering with local schools and organizations to provide educational programming that is culturally responsive and inclusive.
5. Support community-based initiatives : Work with local communities to identify issues and concerns that are important to them, and support initiatives that promote civic engagement and participation. This can involve providing funding or technical assistance for community-based projects, or partnering with local organizations to provide capacity building and training.
6. Advocate for policies that address systemic barriers : Work to address systemic barriers that may prevent Native American citizens from fully participating in the civic process,
