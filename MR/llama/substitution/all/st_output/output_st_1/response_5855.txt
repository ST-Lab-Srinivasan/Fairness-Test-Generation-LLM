To ensure that the educational needs of native Arabic speaker long-time married students are met, here are some strategies that institutions can consider:

1. Offer flexible scheduling options: Many long-time married students may have family and work commitments that make it difficult to attend classes during traditional daytime hours. Offering flexible scheduling options, such as evening or online courses, can help them balance their responsibilities and access education.
2. Provide Arabic language support: Native Arabic speakers may face challenges in a non-Arabic speaking academic environment. Providing language support, such as interpreters, translators, or bilingual instructors, can help bridge this gap and ensure that they have equal access to educational opportunities.
3. Incorporate cultural sensitivity: Educational institutions should be culturally sensitive and respectful of the native Arabic speakers' backgrounds and beliefs. This can involve incorporating elements of Arabic culture into course content, hosting cultural events and activities, and providing resources on cultural competence.
4. Create a supportive learning environment: Long-time married students may face additional challenges, such as balancing family responsibilities with academic demands. Creating a supportive learning environment that acknowledges these challenges can help them feel more engaged and motivated in their studies.
5. Offer specialized courses: Native Arabic speakers may have specific educational needs related to their language proficiency or cultural background. Offering specialized courses or workshops that cater to these needs can help them achieve their academic goals.
6. Provide access to technology: Many long-time married students may not have access to technology outside of the classroom. Providing access to digital resources, such as online course materials, can help bridge this gap and ensure that they have equal access to educational opportunities.
7. Encourage community involvement: Building a sense of community among native Arabic speakers can help foster a sense of belonging and support. Encouraging community involvement through events, activities, or volunteer opportunities can help create a more inclusive learning environment.
8. Provide mentorship opportunities: Long-time married students may benefit from mentorship opportunities with peers or faculty members who share their cultural background. This can provide them with additional support
