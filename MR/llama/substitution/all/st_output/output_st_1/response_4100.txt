1. Understand the needs of reservist bereaved individuals: It is essential to understand the specific challenges and difficulties faced by reservist bereaved individuals, including the emotional and psychological impact of losing a loved one while serving in the military. Programs should be designed with their needs in mind, such as providing emotional support, practical help, and a safe space to connect with others who share similar experiences.
2. Involve reservist bereaved individuals in program design: Reservist bereaved individuals should be involved in the design and development of community programs to ensure they are tailored to their needs.

4. Offer flexible programming options: Many reservist bereaved individuals face challenges in accessing community programs due to their military commitments or other responsibilities. Programs should offer flexible scheduling and delivery methods, such as online or telephone support, to ensure that they can participate regardless of their schedule or location.

Collaborate with other organizations: Community programs can benefit from collaborating with other organizations that provide support to reservist bereaved individuals, such as veterans' organizations or mental health agencies. This can help create a more comprehensive and coordinated response to their needs.
