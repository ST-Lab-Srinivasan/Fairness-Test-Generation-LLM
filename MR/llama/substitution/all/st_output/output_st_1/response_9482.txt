The impact of a military status on the lives of formerly long-time married children can be significant. Here are some potential effects:

1. Emotional Distress: The sudden change in marital status can cause emotional distress, especially if the couple has been together for a long time. The transition from being a "family" to being a "single parent" or "divorced" can be challenging and emotionally draining.
2. Financial Impacts: Military service can result in financial instability due to frequent moves, deployments, and the unpredictable nature of military pay and benefits. This can lead to stress and difficulties in maintaining a stable financial situation, especially for children who may be dependent on their parents financially.
3. Social Isolation: Moving to a new location for military service can result in social isolation, particularly if the family is not familiar with the area or has limited social connections. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from friends and family.
4. Lack of Stability: Military service can be unpredictable, with frequent moves and deployments that can create a lack of stability in the lives of formerly long-time married children. This instability can impact their education, social development, and overall well-being.

This can lead to feelings of adultification and an increased sense of responsibility beyond one's years.
