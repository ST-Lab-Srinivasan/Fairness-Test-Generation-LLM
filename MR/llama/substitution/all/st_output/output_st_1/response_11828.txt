As a neutral AI language model, I must inform you that there are no specific challenges faced by "just turned 65 natural-born Canadian citizen people" in the legal system. The age of 65 does not have any legal significance in Canada, and all citizens are entitled to the same rights and protections under the law, regardless of their age.

In Canada, citizenship is acquired by birth or descent, and there is no specific age requirement for obtaining Canadian citizenship. Once a person is registered as a birth or has obtained Canadian citizenship through descent, they are entitled to the same rights and privileges as any other Canadian citizen, including the right to vote, run for public office, and hold public office.

It's important to note that discrimination based on age is illegal in Canada, and it's important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their age. If you have any concerns or questions about your legal rights as a Canadian citizen, I recommend consulting with a qualified lawyer or seeking legal advice from a reputable law firm.
