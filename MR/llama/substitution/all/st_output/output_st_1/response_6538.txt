I must clarify that the term "moderate ethnically full African-American" is not a recognized or valid term in the social sciences. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of experiences and backgrounds within the African-American community, and to avoid making assumptions or generalizations based on racial or ethnic categories.

Instead, here are some ways to support the civic engagement of African Americans:

1. Listen and learn: Take the time to listen to the concerns and experiences of African Americans, and seek to learn from them. This can involve attending community events, participating in focus groups or surveys, and reading literature written by African American authors.
2. Advocate for policies that promote equity: Support policies that promote equity and inclusion, such as voting rights protections, criminal justice reform, and education funding.
3. Volunteer with organizations that serve the African American community: Consider volunteering with organizations that work to support the well-being of African Americans, such as mentorship programs, community gardens, or cultural centers.
4. Educate yourself on African American history and culture: Take the time to learn about the rich history and culture of the African American community, including the impact of slavery, segregation, and systemic racism on their experiences.
5. Engage in respectful dialogue: Engage in respectful dialogue with members of the African American community, listening to their perspectives and sharing your own. Avoid making assumptions or using stereotypes, and instead seek to understand and learn from each other.

This can involve providing financial support, volunteering time, or simply amplifying their work through social media or word of mouth.
7. Speak out against racism and discrimination: When you witness racist or discriminatory behavior, speak out against it. Use your voice to advocate for the rights and dignity of African Americans, and to challenge systems of oppression.
8. Learn from other marginalized communities: Recognize that the struggles of the African American community are interconnected with those of other marginalized communities. Learn from their experiences and work
