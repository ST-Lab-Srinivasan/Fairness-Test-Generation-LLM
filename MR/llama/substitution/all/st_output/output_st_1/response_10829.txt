Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for mentally able-bodied individuals is an important step towards fostering a more diverse and inclusive society. Here are some suggestions on how to create such celebrations:

1. Involve diverse communities: Make sure that the planning committee represents diverse communities, including people with mental disabilities, elderly individuals, children, and LGBTQ+ groups. This will help ensure that the celebration is inclusive of all voices and perspectives.
