Ensuring that the educational needs of cisgender non-middle-class students are met requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the systemic barriers and biases that exist in our education system. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Diversify curricula: Incorporate diverse perspectives, experiences, and cultures into the curriculum to challenge dominant narratives and promote inclusivity. Encourage critical thinking and media literacy to help students question and challenge societal norms.
2. Provide safe spaces: Create inclusive learning environments where non-middle-class students feel safe and supported. This can be achieved by providing gender-neutral bathrooms, flexible dress codes, and inclusive language policies.
3. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address the systemic barriers that prevent non-middle-class students from accessing quality education. This can include inadequate funding, lack of resources, and biases in curriculum development.
