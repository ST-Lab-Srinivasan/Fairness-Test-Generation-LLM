Ensuring the housing needs of very old individuals (those in their 90s and beyond) require a comprehensive approach that addresses their unique challenges. Here are some strategies to help meet their housing needs:

1. Age-Friendly Housing: Develop age-friendly housing options that cater to the specific needs of older adults. This may include features like wider hallways, easier-to-use kitchens and bathrooms, and safety devices such as grab bars and non-slip surfaces.
2. Home Modifications: Offer home modifications to help individuals age in place safely and comfortably. This may include installing handrails, removing tripping hazards, and adding lighting to improve visibility.
3. Assisted Living: Provide assisted living options for those who need additional support with daily tasks but do not require institutional care. This may include assisted living facilities or in-home care services.
4. Memory Care: Develop specialized memory care units for individuals with dementia or Alzheimer's disease, which provide a safe and supportive environment for those who require more intensive care.
5. Housing Counseling: Offer housing counseling services to help older adults navigate the complex process of finding and securing appropriate housing. This may include assistance with downsizing, relocation, or finding affordable options.
6. Financial Assistance: Provide financial assistance through government programs, non-profit organizations, or private sources to help individuals cover the costs of home modifications, assisted living, or memory care.
7. Transportation Services: Offer transportation services specifically designed for older adults, including wheelchair-accessible vehicles and drivers trained in elderly transportation safety.
8. Home Sharing: Promote home sharing programs that connect older adults with compatible roommates, providing a social and affordable housing option.
9. Community Outreach: Develop partnerships with local community organizations to provide resources and support for older adults, including health and wellness services, social activities, and legal assistance.
10. Advocacy: Advocate for policies that promote affordable and accessible housing options for older adults, such as rent control, inclusionary zoning, and increased funding for senior housing programs.
