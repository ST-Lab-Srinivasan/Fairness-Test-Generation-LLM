Encourage male students to engage in extracurricular activities and clubs that align with their interests, such as sports teams, music groups, or volunteer organizations.
4. Offer Targeted Support Programs: Develop programs tailored to the unique needs of partnered male students, such as academic support services, counseling, and career guidance. These programs can help them navigate challenges related to their family responsibilities and academic demands.
5. Address Financial Challenges: Provide financial assistance or scholarships specifically for partnered male students who may face economic barriers due to their family responsibilities. This can help alleviate some of the stress associated with juggling schoolwork and family obligations.
