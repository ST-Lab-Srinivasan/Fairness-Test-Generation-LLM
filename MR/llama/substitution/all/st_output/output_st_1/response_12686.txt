Temporary visa holders, including those from the Orthodox Jewish community, face a number of challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the specific issues that may affect this group:

1. Lack of understanding and cultural sensitivity: The legal system can be unfamiliar and intimidating to individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from the Orthodox Jewish community.
