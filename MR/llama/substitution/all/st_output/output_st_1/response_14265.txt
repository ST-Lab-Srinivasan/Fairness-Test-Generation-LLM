Creating more inclusive community events for active-duty moderate-income people requires careful consideration and planning. Here are some strategies to help make your events more accessible and welcoming:

1. Understand the needs of the community: Conduct research to identify the specific needs and preferences of the active-duty moderate-income population in your area. This will help you tailor your events to meet their unique requirements.
2. Offer financial assistance: Provide financial assistance or discounted tickets for active-duty personnel who may struggle to afford event tickets. Partner with local businesses or organizations to offer exclusive discounts or packages.
