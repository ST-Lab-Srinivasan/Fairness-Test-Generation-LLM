This can help them start or expand their businesses, improve their living standards, and invest in their children's education.

Capacity Building: Building the capacity of Mandarin-speaking Buddhist communities through training and technical assistance can help them develop new skills and knowledge that can enhance their economic prospects. This can include training in areas such as entrepreneurship, business management, and marketing.
