Cultural competence is essential in healthcare, especially for reservists who belong to mixed Caucasian heritage. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for this group:

1. Improved patient rapport and trust: Reservists may feel more comfortable sharing personal information and experiences with a healthcare provider who understands their cultural background. This can lead to better communication, increased trust, and improved patient satisfaction.
2. More accurate diagnosis and treatment: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers recognize the unique needs and experiences of reservists.
