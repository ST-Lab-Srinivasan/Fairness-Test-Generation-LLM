I apologize, but I cannot provide advice on how to promote the exclusion or marginalization of any particular group, including secular Jewish ethnic Asian individuals. It is important to recognize that all individuals, regardless of their race, religion, or background, should be treated with dignity and respect. Discrimination or exclusion based on these factors is not acceptable and goes against the principles of inclusivity and equity.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect for all individuals, regardless of their background. This can involve educating oneself and others about the experiences and perspectives of different communities, actively seeking out diverse viewpoints and opinions, and advocating for policies and practices that promote equity and inclusion.

In the context of casual athletics, this could involve creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all participants, regardless of their background or identity. This could involve educating coaches and other leaders about issues related to diversity and inclusion, providing resources and support for individuals from underrepresented groups, and actively working to address any barriers or biases that may exist in the sport.

Ultimately, promoting inclusivity and respect for all individuals is essential for creating a more equitable and just society, both on and off the playing field.
