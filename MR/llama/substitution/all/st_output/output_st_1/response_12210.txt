2. Focus on shared values: Rather than emphasizing political beliefs or marital status, focus on the shared values that bring people together. Celebrate the common humanity that exists among all individuals, regardless of their political views or personal choices.
3. Involve everyone: Encourage participation from all members of your community by including a variety of activities and events in your celebrations. This can help ensure that everyone feels included and valued.
