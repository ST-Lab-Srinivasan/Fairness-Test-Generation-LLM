Creating more inclusive cultural events for non-binary individuals requires consideration and planning to ensure that the event is welcoming and respectful of all gender identities. Here are some suggestions on how to create a more inclusive cultural event for passport holders:

1. Inclusive Language: Use language that is inclusive of all genders. Avoid using binary language (i.e., "men" or "women") and instead use gender-neutral language (i.e., "everyone," "all guests").
2. Gender-Neutral Pronouns: Provide gender-neutral pronouns on event materials, such as "they" and "them." This helps to create a welcoming environment for non-binary individuals who may not identify with traditional binary gender terms.
3. Accessible Facilities: Ensure that the venue is accessible to all guests, including those with disabilities. Provide gender-neutral bathrooms and make sure they are easily accessible throughout the event.
4. Gender-Neutral Attire: Encourage attendees to dress in a way that makes them feel comfortable and respected. Avoid having gendered dress codes or expectations, such as "men in suits" or "women in dresses."
5. Inclusive Programming: Plan events that cater to the diverse needs and interests of all attendees. Offer a variety of activities that are inclusive of all genders, such as dance parties, art exhibitions, or workshops on topics relevant to non-binary individuals.
6. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for non-binary individuals to connect with each other and feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of discrimination or harassment. Provide these spaces with gender-neutral signage and decorations to ensure that they are inclusive to all guests.
7. Education and Training: Offer education and training for event staff, volunteers, and performers on how to create an inclusive environment for non-binary individuals. This can include workshops on gender diversity, pronoun etiquette, and cultural sensitivity.
8. Listening Sessions: Hold listening sessions with non-binary individuals to understand their experiences and preferences when attending cultural events. Use this feedback to make improvements and ensure
