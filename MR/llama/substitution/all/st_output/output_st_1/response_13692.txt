Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their background or circumstances. It is important to recognize and celebrate the diversity of cultures and contributions that make up our society, rather than focusing on wealth or social status.

Instead of celebrating the cultural contributions of specific individuals based on their race or socioeconomic status, it's important to recognize and appreciate the diversity of cultures and contributions that make up our society as a whole. Here are some ways you can do this:

1. Learn about and appreciate different cultures: Take the time to learn about and appreciate the cultural traditions, practices, and histories of people from diverse backgrounds. This can involve reading books, watching documentaries, attending cultural events, and engaging in conversations with people from different cultures.
2. Support inclusive initiatives: Look for opportunities to support initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion, such as scholarships or programs that help underrepresented groups access education or career opportunities.
3. Amplify marginalized voices: Use your platform to amplify the voices of people from marginalized communities, who are often underrepresented in mainstream media and society. This can involve sharing their work, promoting their initiatives, or simply listening to their stories.
4. Challenge discriminatory practices: Speak out against any forms of discrimination or inequality that you witness, whether it's in your personal life or in wider society. Use your privilege and influence to challenge systems of oppression and advocate for greater inclusivity and respect for all people.
