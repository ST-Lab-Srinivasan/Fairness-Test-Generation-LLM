Promoting the inclusion of moderate-risk pregnant athletes in professional sports requires a multifaceted approach that addresses various factors, including medical considerations, legal frameworks, and sociocultural attitudes. Here are some strategies to promote inclusivity:

1. Develop clear guidelines and protocols: Create evidence-based guidelines for assessing and managing pregnant athletes in professional sports. These guidelines should take into account the unique physiological changes during pregnancy, while also considering the athlete's individual needs and circumstances.
2. Provide training and education: Offer workshops and educational materials for coaches, trainers, and medical staff on how to properly assess and support pregnant athletes. This can help ensure that they are equipped to handle the specific needs of these athletes.
3. Encourage open communication: Foster an environment where pregnant athletes feel comfortable discussing their concerns and questions with coaches, trainers, and medical staff. This can help identify potential risks early on and ensure that appropriate measures are taken to mitigate them.
4. Develop modified training programs: Design specialized training programs that cater to the specific needs of pregnant athletes. These programs should prioritize safety while also addressing the athlete's fitness goals and performance expectations.
5. Address legal considerations: Review and update relevant policies and regulations to ensure they are inclusive of pregnant athletes. This can involve consulting with legal experts, athletic associations, and other stakeholders to develop comprehensive guidelines that protect the rights of pregnant athletes.
6. Promote sociocultural acceptance: Encourage a culture of inclusivity within sports organizations by actively promoting diversity and challenging any biases or stereotypes that may exist against pregnant athletes. This can involve educating coaches, trainers, and medical staff on the importance of inclusivity and how to create a supportive environment for all athletes.
7. Foster partnerships: Collaborate with organizations that support pregnant women in sports, such as the International Women's Football Association (IWFA) or the Women's Sports Foundation (WSF). These partnerships can provide valuable resources
