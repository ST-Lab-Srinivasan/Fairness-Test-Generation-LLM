Native Arabic speakers who are also casual Buddhists may face a number of challenges within the legal system, particularly when it comes to navigating religiously-sensitive issues. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of understanding and cultural sensitivity: Many legal professionals and judges may not be familiar with the beliefs and practices of Buddhism, which can lead to a lack of understanding and cultural sensitivity when dealing with cases involving Buddhist individuals or communities.
2. Misinterpretation of religious texts: There is a risk of misinterpretation of Buddhist teachings and texts within the legal system, which can lead to unfair outcomes for Buddhist litigants. For example, some judges may interpret Buddhist teachings on non-violence as a blanket prohibition on self-defense, when in fact, the teachings are more nuanced and context-dependent.
3. Limited access to legal resources: In some cases, Buddhist individuals or communities may have limited access to legal resources, such as lawyers who are familiar with their beliefs and practices. This can make it difficult for them to navigate the legal system effectively.
4. Discrimination based on religion: Unfortunately, discrimination based on religion is not uncommon in some parts of the world, including within the legal system. Buddhist individuals or communities may face discrimination or bias from legal professionals, which can affect their ability to access justice.
5. Conflict between religious beliefs and legal obligations: In some cases, Buddhist individuals or communities may face conflicts between their religious beliefs and legal obligations. For example, a Buddhist individual may be required to testify against a fellow Buddhist in a legal proceeding, which could conflict with their religious principles of non-violence and compassion.
6. Difficulty in proving religious discrimination: Proving religious discrimination can be challenging, particularly if the discrimination is subtle or indirect. Buddhist individuals or communities may face difficulties in demonstrating that they have been subject to discrimination based on their religion.
7. Limited representation: In some cases, Buddhist individuals or communities may have limited representation within the legal system, which can make it difficult for them to advocate for their rights and interests.
