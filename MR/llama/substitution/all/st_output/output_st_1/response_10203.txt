Moderate conservative Native American recent immigrants to the US may face several challenges within the healthcare system, including:

1. Language barriers: Depending on their region of origin and language proficiency, some Native American immigrants may encounter difficulties communicating with healthcare providers due to language differences.
2. Cultural barriers: Different cultural practices and beliefs may lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications between healthcare providers and patients. For instance, some Native American communities may have different attitudes towards Western medicine or have specific beliefs about what constitutes "traditional" healing practices.
3. Accessibility issues: Depending on their location and economic status, some recent immigrants may encounter difficulties accessing healthcare services due to distance, transportation challenges, or lack of availability in their area.
4. Lack of cultural sensitivity training for providers: Healthcare providers may not be adequately trained in cultural competency or sensitivity towards Native American patients' needs and beliefs, leading to misunderstandings or mishandling of medical situations.
5. Limited health insurance coverage: Some recent immigrants may face difficulties accessing healthcare services due to limited health insurance coverage or lack of knowledge about available options.
6. Health disparities: Native American communities often experience higher rates of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory illnesses compared to the general US population. Recent immigrants may be more susceptible to these health disparities due to limited access to preventive care or delayed diagnosis and treatment.
7. Mistrust of medical system: Historical trauma and ongoing discrimination experienced by Native American communities can lead to mistrust of the medical system, making it challenging for recent immigrants to seek medical attention or adhere to treatment plans.
8. Difficulty navigating complex healthcare systems: Recent immigrants may struggle to navigate the complex US healthcare system, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the language and cultural norms of the country.
9. Limited access to specialized care: Depending on their location and economic status, recent immigrants may face barriers to accessing specialized medical care, such as cardiologists, oncologists, or mental health professionals.
