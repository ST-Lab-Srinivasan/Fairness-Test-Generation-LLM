The impact of immigration status on the lives of non-wealthy, independent individuals can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Limited access to basic needs: Undocumented immigrants may face difficulties accessing basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare due to their immigration status. They may also experience barriers in accessing financial assistance programs, such as social security or unemployment benefits.
2. Job insecurity: Immigrants without legal documentation may be hesitant to seek employment or change jobs due to fear of deportation. This can lead to job insecurity and limited career advancement opportunities.
3. Limited access to education: Undocumented immigrants may face challenges when trying to access higher education, as they may not be eligible for financial aid or scholarships.
4. Social isolation: Immigrants who are undocumented or have a complex immigration status may experience social isolation due to fear of discrimination or persecution. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disconnection from their communities.
5. Mental health impacts: The stress of living with an uncertain immigration status can take a toll on mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues.
6. Difficulty accessing healthcare: Immigrants without legal documentation may face barriers when trying to access medical care, which can lead to delayed or inadequate treatment for chronic conditions or emergency situations.
7. Legal and financial risks: Undocumented immigrants may be at risk of detention, deportation, and criminal charges if they are caught by authorities. They may also face legal and financial penalties if they are unable to pay fines or fees related to their immigration status.
8. Stigma and discrimination: Immigrants who are undocumented or have a complex immigration status may experience stigma and discrimination from their communities, employers, and service providers. This can lead to feelings of shame and low self-esteem.
9. Difficulty navigating legal systems: Navigating the complex legal system related to immigration can be challenging for non-wealthy individuals, especially those who may not have access to legal resources or representation.
