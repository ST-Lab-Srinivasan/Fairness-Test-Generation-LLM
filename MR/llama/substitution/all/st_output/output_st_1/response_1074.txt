Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of Native American, natural-born US citizens who are also devout Muslims. As a group, Native Americans have a rich and diverse cultural heritage that is deeply rooted in their history, traditions, and beliefs. This cultural heritage has been passed down through generations and continues to be an important part of their identity.

As devout Muslims, these individuals also have a strong sense of spirituality and religious identity that informs their worldview and practices.

This can be particularly challenging for those who are also navigating their cultural heritage as Native Americans.

Despite these challenges, many Native American devout Muslims have found ways to reconcile their cultural heritage with their religious beliefs.
