As a recent immigrant to the US, devout Christians may face several challenges within the legal system. Here are some of the common issues they may encounter:

For example, they may be prohibited from practicing their faith in certain public spaces or institutions, such as schools or government buildings.

They may struggle to understand legal terminology, procedures, and practices, which can put them at a disadvantage in legal proceedings.

They may also face pressure to conform to certain beliefs or practices that conflict with their religious views.
