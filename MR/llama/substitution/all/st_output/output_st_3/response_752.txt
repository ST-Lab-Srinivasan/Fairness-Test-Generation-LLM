As a Buddhist organization, supporting the career aspirations of casual Buddhists who are recently expecting can be done in several ways:

1. Provide resources and information: Offer resources such as books, articles, and websites that provide guidance on how to navigate their career aspirations while also being mindful of their new role as parents.
2. Host workshops and seminars: Organize workshops and seminars that cater to the specific needs of expectant parents, covering topics such as balancing work and family responsibilities, managing stress, and setting realistic career goals.
3. Create a support network: Facilitate the creation of a support network among expectant parents, where they can share their experiences, challenges, and successes with each other. This can be done through online forums, in-person meetings, or even mentorship programs.
4. Offer flexible work arrangements: Encourage employers to offer flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, flexible hours, or job sharing to help expectant parents balance their work and family responsibilities.
5. Advocate for family-friendly policies: Work with organizations and policymakers to advocate for family-friendly policies that support the career aspirations of expectant parents, such as paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements, and affordable childcare.
6. Provide financial support: Offer financial support or resources to help expectant parents cover the costs associated with starting a family, such as maternity or paternity leave, baby supplies, or even start-up capital for a new business venture.
7. Connect them with role models and mentors: Introduce expectant parents to successful professionals who have balanced their career aspirations with parenthood, and provide opportunities for mentorship and networking.
8. Offer coaching or counseling services: Provide coaching or counseling services specifically tailored to the needs of expectant parents, helping them navigate the emotional and psychological changes associated with this life stage.
9. Create a community platform: Develop an online platform or app that connects expectant parents with resources, support, and each other, allowing them to share their experiences, ask questions, and get advice from peers and experts.
