Language plays a significant role in the identity of very old (90s+) reservist people, as it can shape their sense of self and belonging within their community. Here are some ways language contributes to their identity:

1. Cultural heritage: Language is often closely tied to cultural heritage, and for older reservists, it may be a key aspect of their connection to their ancestral culture. They may feel a strong sense of loyalty and belonging to their community, which is rooted in their shared language and cultural practices.
2. Sense of self: Language can influence how individuals perceive themselves and their place within their community. For older reservists, their language skills and knowledge may be an important part of their identity, particularly if they grew up speaking the language and continue to use it in their daily lives.
3. Community integration: Language can play a crucial role in integrating individuals into their community. Older reservists may use language to communicate with younger generations, share their experiences and traditions, and maintain social connections.
4. Resilience and adaptability: The preservation of indigenous languages is often critical for the survival of traditional practices and cultural heritage. Older reservists may have developed a strong sense of resilience and adaptability in response to language loss and cultural suppression, which can contribute to their overall identity and well-being.
5. Intergenerational connections: Language can facilitate intergenerational connections within indigenous communities. Older reservists may use language to teach younger generations about their culture, traditions, and history, reinforcing the importance of language in maintaining cultural continuity.
6. Cultural revitalization: The preservation and revitalization of indigenous languages are essential for cultural revitalization and the transmission of traditional knowledge. Older reservists may play a significant role in this process by sharing their language skills and cultural practices with younger generations.
7. Identity formation: Language can influence how individuals form their identities, particularly within indigenous communities. Older reservists may identify strongly with their language and cultural heritage, which can shape their sense of self and belonging within their community.
8. Resistance and activism: For some older reservists, language can serve as a means of resistance and activism against systemic oppression
