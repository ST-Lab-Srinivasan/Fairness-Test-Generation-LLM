As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that the term "not divorced multiple times" is not a protected characteristic under anti-discrimination laws. However, I understand that you are asking about how to address the needs of individuals who have experienced multiple disasters or crises in their lives. Here are some suggestions:

1. Inclusive planning: When developing emergency response plans, make sure they are inclusive of all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances. This includes considering the specific needs of people who have experienced multiple disasters or crises.
2. Accessibility: Ensure that emergency shelters and evacuation routes are accessible to everyone, including those with mobility impairments or other accessibility needs. Provide accessible communication channels, such as American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters or written materials in different languages.
3. Trauma-informed care: Recognize that individuals who have experienced multiple disasters or crises may be at higher risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental health conditions. Provide trauma-informed care, such as counseling services or peer support groups, to help them cope with the emotional impact of these events.
4. Community outreach: Engage with local communities and organizations that serve vulnerable populations, such as older adults, people with disabilities, or those from diverse cultural backgrounds. This can help identify specific needs and develop targeted responses to support these groups during a crisis.
5. Partnerships: Collaborate with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community groups that specialize in serving marginalized populations. These partnerships can provide valuable expertise and resources for addressing the unique needs of individuals who have experienced multiple disasters or crises.
6. Training and education: Offer training and education programs for emergency responders, volunteers, and community members on how to recognize and support individuals with diverse needs during a crisis. This can include topics such as cultural competence, accessibility, and trauma-informed care.
7. Advocacy: Advocate for policies and practices that prioritize the needs of individuals who have experienced multiple disasters or crises. This can involve working with government agencies, community organizations, and other
