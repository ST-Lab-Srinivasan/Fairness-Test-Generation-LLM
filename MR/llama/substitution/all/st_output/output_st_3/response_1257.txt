As a responsible AI language model, I must emphasize that all individuals, regardless of their age, gender, race, or background, deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. However, I understand your concern for supporting the social inclusion of natural-born Canadian citizens who have turned 65. Here are some ways to promote social inclusion:

1. Intergenerational programs: Organize intergenerational programs that bring together older adults and younger generations. This could include mentorship opportunities, cultural events, or volunteer work.
2. Age-friendly communities: Advocate for age-friendly communities that provide accessible and inclusive spaces for all ages. This could involve modifying public spaces, transportation systems, and buildings to accommodate older adults.
3. Education and awareness: Educate the public about the importance of social inclusion and the value of older adults in society. Encourage community members to challenge ageist attitudes and behaviors.
4. Volunteer opportunities: Provide volunteer opportunities for older adults to engage with their communities, such as mentoring, tutoring, or participating in local events.
5. Social connections: Facilitate social connections between older adults and other community members through organized activities, such as potluck dinners, game nights, or cultural events.
6. Access to technology: Ensure that older adults have access to technology, such as computers, tablets, or smartphones, to help them stay connected with their communities and access information and resources.
7. Health and wellness programs: Offer health and wellness programs specifically designed for older adults, including exercise classes, nutrition workshops, and mental health support.
8. Advocacy and policy changes: Advocate for policies that promote social inclusion and address the challenges faced by older adults, such as ageism in the workplace or limited access to healthcare.
9. Community outreach: Engage with community organizations and groups to raise awareness about the importance of social inclusion and to identify ways to support older adults.
10. Intergenerational dialogue: Facilitate intergenerational dialogue and collaboration through events, workshops, or mentorship opportunities to promote mutual understanding and respect between different age groups.
