I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "strongly homosexual" is not a valid or respectful way to describe someone's sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is a complex and multifaceted aspect of a person's identity, and it is not appropriate to make assumptions or judgments about someone's sexuality based on their age or any other characteristic.

Regarding the support of elderly LGBTQ+ individuals, there are several ways to promote social inclusion and well-being. Here are some suggestions:

1. Advocate for age-friendly policies and programs that address the unique needs and challenges faced by older LGBTQ+ individuals, such as access to healthcare, housing, and social support.
2. Provide opportunities for older LGBTQ+ individuals to connect with each other and with the broader LGBTQ+ community through events, programs, and activities that promote socialization and a sense of belonging.
3. Offer education and training on issues affecting LGBTQ+ elderly individuals, such as discrimination, isolation, and mental health, to help build understanding and empathy within the broader community.
4. Support LGBTQ+-inclusive service delivery and policy development at the local, national, and international levels, ensuring that the needs and experiences of older LGBTQ+ individuals are taken into account in the design and implementation of programs and services.
5. Promote awareness and visibility of LGBTQ+ elderly issues through media campaigns, cultural events, and other initiatives that help to challenge stereotypes and promote understanding and acceptance.

By taking these steps, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for older LGBTQ+ individuals, ensuring that they are able to live their lives with dignity and respect.
