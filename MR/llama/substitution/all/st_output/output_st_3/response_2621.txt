Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-term widowed native French speakers. The loss of a spouse can have a profound impact on an individual's sense of self, leading to feelings of grief, disorientation, and confusion. However, cultural heritage can provide a sense of stability and continuity in times of loss. This study aims to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of long-term widowed native French speakers.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can have a profound impact on an individual's sense of identity (Hall, 1990). Cultural heritage includes shared values, beliefs, customs, and traditions that are passed down from one generation to the next. For long-term widowed native French speakers, cultural heritage can provide a sense of belonging and connection to their roots, which can be particularly important during times of loss.

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach, with in-depth interviews conducted with long-term widowed native French speakers. Participants will be recruited through local community groups and organizations that support widows. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted, focusing on participants' experiences of loss, their perceptions of cultural heritage, and how these have influenced their sense of identity.

Results:
Preliminary findings indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of long-term widowed native French speakers. Participants reported feeling a strong connection to their cultural heritage, which provided a sense of comfort and familiarity during times of loss. Cultural heritage was seen as a source of strength and resilience, helping participants to cope with the challenges of widowhood.

Conclusion:

It provides a sense of belonging, connection to one's roots, and a source of strength during times of loss. This study highlights the importance of cultural heritage in supporting individuals in
