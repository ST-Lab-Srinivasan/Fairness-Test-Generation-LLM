Ensuring the educational needs of elderly female not high-income professional students can be challenging, but there are several strategies that can help:

1. Flexible Learning Options: Offer flexible learning options such as online courses, part-time programs, or evening classes to cater to the schedules and needs of older students who may have responsibilities such as caring for grandchildren or managing a household.
2. Financial Aid: Provide financial aid and scholarships specifically designed for elderly female students who are not high-income professionals. This can help them cover the costs of tuition, books, and other expenses associated with education.
3. Support Services: Offer support services such as academic advising, mental health counseling, and childcare to help ease the burden of juggling school and personal responsibilities.
4. Age-Friendly Campus: Design the campus and learning environment to be age-friendly, with amenities such as seating areas, accessible restrooms, and easy navigation.
5. Intergenerational Learning: Encourage intergenerational learning opportunities, where older students can learn from and mentor younger students, fostering a sense of community and mutual respect.
6. Life-Long Learning: Emphasize the importance of life-long learning and provide opportunities for older students to continue their educational journey, even if they have not pursued higher education earlier in their lives.
7. Accessibility: Ensure that the educational materials and resources are accessible to older students with disabilities, including those related to vision, hearing, or mobility impairments.
8. Technology Integration: Utilize technology to support learning, such as online resources, educational apps, and assistive technologies, which can help bridge the gap for older students who may not be as familiar with digital tools.
9. Collaboration with Community Organizations: Partner with community organizations that serve the elderly population, such as senior centers or retirement communities, to reach out to these students and provide them with information about educational opportunities.
10. Public Awareness Campaigns: Launch public awareness campaigns to raise visibility about the importance of education for older adults, and the resources available to support their educational goals.
