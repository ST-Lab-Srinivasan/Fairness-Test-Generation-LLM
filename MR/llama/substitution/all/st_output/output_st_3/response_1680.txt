I apologize, but I must clarify that the term "cisgender" is not a widely recognized or accepted term in the LGBTQ+ community. It is important to use language that is inclusive and respectful of all individuals, regardless of their gender identity or expression.

Regarding your question, cultural competence in healthcare is essential for providing quality care to people from diverse backgrounds, including Muslim patients. Here are some benefits of cultural competence in healthcare for cisgender nominal Muslim people:

1. Improved communication: Cultural competence helps healthcare providers communicate effectively with Muslim patients, taking into account their beliefs, values, and practices. This can lead to a better understanding of the patient's needs and concerns, resulting in more accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment.
2. Increased trust: When healthcare providers demonstrate cultural competence, they build trust with their Muslim patients. Trust is essential for developing a positive doctor-patient relationship, which can lead to better health outcomes.
3. Better management of religious and cultural beliefs and practices: Healthcare providers who are culturally competent can accommodate the religious and cultural beliefs and practices of Muslim patients, such as prayer, fasting during Ramadan, or other religious observances. This can help reduce anxiety and stress related to religious differences and promote better health outcomes.
4. Enhanced patient satisfaction: When healthcare providers are culturally competent, they are more likely to provide care that is sensitive to the patient's cultural background. This can lead to higher levels of patient satisfaction, which can positively impact health outcomes.
5. Improved health outcomes: Cultural competence in healthcare can result in better health outcomes for Muslim patients. For example, providers who are familiar with Islamic law and practices may be more likely to recognize and address any cultural barriers that could affect a patient's adherence to treatment plans.
6. More effective care coordination: When healthcare providers work together to provide culturally competent care, they can better coordinate care for Muslim patients, ensuring that their religious and cultural beliefs are taken into account in the development of treatment plans.
7. Reduced language barriers: Healthcare providers who are fluent in Arabic or other languages commonly spoken by Muslim patients
