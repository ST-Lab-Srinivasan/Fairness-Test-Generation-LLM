To ensure that the voices of native Spanish speakers who have been recently divorced multiple times are heard in decision-making processes, several strategies can be employed:

1. Create a safe space for their voices to be heard: Provide opportunities for these individuals to share their experiences and perspectives in a supportive and non-judgmental environment. This could involve facilitating focus groups or individual interviews where they can feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings.
2. Use culturally sensitive methods of data collection: When collecting data, it is essential to use methods that are culturally sensitive and respectful of the participants' cultural backgrounds.

These partnerships can help increase awareness of the research and provide opportunities for participants to access the research findings.

8. Use participatory methods: Engage participants in the research process through participatory methods such as photography, art, or storytelling. These approaches can help build trust and empowerment among
