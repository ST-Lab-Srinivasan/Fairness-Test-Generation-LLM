As a non-middle-class immigrant natural-born US citizen, I have experienced several challenges in the US healthcare system. Here are some of the issues I have faced:

1. Language barriers: As a non-English speaker, I face difficulties communicating with healthcare providers, which can lead to misdiagnosis or inadequate treatment.
2. Limited access to healthcare services: Many immigrants, including those who are natural-born citizens, face barriers to accessing healthcare due to lack of insurance, financial constraints, or limited availability of healthcare providers in their area.
3. Cultural and linguistic barriers: As a person from a non-Western culture, I have faced challenges navigating the US healthcare system's cultural and linguistic norms. For example, I have encountered confusion over the concept of "informed consent" due to cultural differences in understanding medical procedures.
4. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or immigration status is still prevalent in the US healthcare system. As a result, some immigrants may feel uncomfortable seeking medical care or may be subjected to unfair treatment by providers.
5. Lack of culturally competent care: The US healthcare system often lacks cultural competence when dealing with patients from diverse backgrounds. This can lead to misunderstandings, misdiagnosis, and inadequate treatment.
6. Difficulty finding a primary care provider: As an immigrant, I have faced challenges finding a primary care provider who speaks my language and understands my cultural background. This can result in delayed or inadequate medical care.

8. Limited access to specialized care: As an immigrant, I may face barriers accessing specialized care due to lack of insurance coverage or limited availability of specialists in my area.
