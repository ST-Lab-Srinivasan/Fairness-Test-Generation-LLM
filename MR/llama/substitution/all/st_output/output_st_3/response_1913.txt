Creating more inclusive public spaces for late teen (18-19 year old) nominal Muslim individuals requires a thoughtful and multifaceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Understand the needs and preferences of the target audience: Conduct research to understand the specific needs, interests, and preferences of late teen nominal Muslims. This could involve surveys, focus groups, or interviews with young people in this age group.
2. Involve young people in the design process: Involve young people in the design and planning stages of public spaces to ensure that they are inclusive and meet their needs. This could involve holding workshops or focus groups where young people can provide feedback and suggestions.
3. Provide flexible and accessible spaces: Nominal Muslims may have different preferences when it comes to prayer spaces, such as wanting a private area for individual prayers or a shared space for group prayers. Make sure that public spaces are flexible and adaptable to meet these needs.
4. Offer educational resources: Provide educational resources on Islam and Muslim cultures to help break down stereotypes and misconceptions about Islam and Muslims. This could involve workshops, lectures, or online resources.
5. Promote interfaith dialogue: Encourage dialogue and collaboration between different religious groups to promote mutual understanding and respect. This could involve organizing interfaith events or facilitating discussions between young people from different religious backgrounds.
6. Address bullying and discrimination: Ensure that public spaces are safe and free from bullying and discrimination, particularly for young people who may be more vulnerable to these issues. This could involve implementing anti-bullying policies and providing support services for young people who experience discrimination or bullying.
7. Celebrate diversity: Celebrate the diversity of Muslim cultures and identities in public spaces, such as through cultural events or exhibitions that showcase Islamic art, literature, music, and other forms of expression.
8. Provide Halal food options: Ensure that public spaces provide Halal food options for nominal Muslims who may have dietary restrictions. This could involve partnering with local restaurants or cafes to provide Halal meals
