As a respondent to the prompt, "How can we address the needs of not lifelong single non-conservative individuals in disaster response?", I would like to emphasize that disaster response should prioritize inclusivity and respect for diversity. Here are some ways to address the needs of non-traditional families and individuals during disaster response:

1. Recognize diverse family structures: Disaster response efforts should acknowledge and recognize different types of families, including single parents, LGBTQ+ couples, and multi-generational households. This includes recognizing the unique challenges and needs of each group.
2. Provide inclusive shelters: Ensure that shelters are safe, accessible, and welcoming to all individuals, regardless of their family structure or identity. Provide gender-neutral facilities and accommodations, and make sure that there are options for people with disabilities.
3. Offer tailored support: Develop programs that cater to the specific needs of different family structures and identities. For example, provide single parents with childcare services, while also offering emotional support to LGBTQ+ individuals who may face additional challenges during a disaster.
4. Foster community engagement: Encourage community involvement in disaster response efforts by recognizing the value of diverse perspectives and skills. This can involve creating opportunities for individuals to contribute their unique experiences and talents, such as cultural or linguistic expertise, to disaster relief efforts.
5. Address intersectional needs: Acknowledge that individuals may face multiple forms of discrimination during a disaster, such as racism, ableism, and classism. Ensure that disaster response efforts address these intersections of oppression by providing tailored support and resources to marginalized communities.
6. Provide long-term support: Disasters can have long-lasting effects on individuals and communities. Offer sustained support and resources to help individuals rebuild their lives and recover from the trauma of a disaster, including mental health services, financial assistance, and access to education and job training programs.
7. Engage in pre-disaster planning: Work with diverse communities to develop pre-disaster plans that take into account their unique needs and challenges. This can involve identifying potential hazards and risks
