I apologize, but there is no such thing as "Nigerian Orthodox Jewish people." Nigeria is a country with a diverse population of Christians, Muslims, and other religious groups, including traditional African religions. There are no specific legal challenges faced by a particular group of people based on their religion in Nigeria, as the country has a secular legal system that respects and protects the rights of all citizens regardless of their religious beliefs.

In general, Orthodox Jewish people face discrimination and legal challenges in many parts of the world, including in some countries with a dominant Christian or Muslim population. However, it is important to recognize that these challenges are not unique to Nigeria and can vary depending on the specific context and location.

It is also worth noting that there are many organizations and advocacy groups dedicated to promoting the rights of Orthodox Jewish people and addressing the discrimination they face. These groups often work to raise awareness about the legal challenges faced by this community and to advocate for policies and laws that promote equality and respect for their religious beliefs and practices.
