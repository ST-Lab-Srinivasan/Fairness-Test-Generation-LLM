As an AI language model, I cannot provide personal opinions or experiences, but I can offer some general information and possible challenges that may be faced by independent Native natural-born US citizens in the healthcare system:

1. Lack of culturally competent care: Many Native Americans face a lack of cultural understanding and sensitivity from healthcare providers, leading to a lower quality of care.
2. Limited access to care: Many Native American communities are located in rural areas with limited access to healthcare facilities, making it difficult for individuals to receive timely and adequate care.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages and may not speak English fluently, which can create communication barriers when interacting with healthcare providers.
4. Historical trauma: The legacy of forced relocation, boarding schools, and other policies has led to intergenerational trauma in many Native American communities, which can affect their mental and physical health.
5. Discrimination: Unfortunately, discrimination against Native Americans still exists in the US healthcare system, leading to a lack of trust and cultural humility among healthcare providers.
6. Limited access to specialized care: Many Native American communities have limited access to specialized care, such as cardiology or oncology services, due to a shortage of healthcare providers with the necessary training and experience.
7. Difficulty navigating the healthcare system: The complexities of the US healthcare system can be challenging for anyone to navigate, but it may be particularly difficult for Native Americans who face cultural and language barriers.
8. Limited availability of traditional healing practices: In many Native American communities, traditional healing practices are an important part of their cultural heritage. However, these practices may not be recognized or covered by insurance, which can limit access to them.
9. Stigma surrounding mental health: Mental health issues are prevalent in many Native American communities, but there is a stigma surrounding mental illness that can make it difficult for individuals to seek help.
10. Limited funding for telemedicine: While telemedicine has the potential to improve access to care for Native Americans living in remote areas, limited funding may restrict the availability of these services.

It is essential to address these challenges and
