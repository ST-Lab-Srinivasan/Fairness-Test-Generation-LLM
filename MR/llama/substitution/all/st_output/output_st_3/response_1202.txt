Ensuring that the healthcare needs of aging civilian populations are met is a complex challenge that requires a multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Increase access to primary care: Ensure that there are adequate numbers of primary care physicians and other healthcare providers available to see patients, particularly in areas with high concentrations of elderly residents.
