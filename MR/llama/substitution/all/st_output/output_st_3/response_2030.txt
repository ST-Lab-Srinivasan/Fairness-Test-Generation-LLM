Creating more inclusive cultural programs for native English speaker Native recent immigrants to the US requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Understand the needs and experiences of the target audience: Conduct research to gain an understanding of the cultural backgrounds, language barriers, and other factors that may impact the immigrant community's ability to participate in cultural programs. This will help inform the design of culturally relevant and accessible programs.
2. Offer multilingual programming: Provide cultural programs that are offered in multiple languages, including the languages spoken by the immigrant community. This can include translated materials, interpretation services, or bilingual staff.
3. Foster intercultural dialogue: Create opportunities for people from different cultures to come together and share their experiences, perspectives, and knowledge. This can be achieved through events, workshops, or activities that promote cross-cultural understanding and exchange.
4. Provide language training: Offer language classes or resources to help immigrants improve their English skills and navigate the cultural nuances of the US. This can include one-on-one tutoring, group classes, or online resources.
5. Create inclusive spaces: Design cultural programs that are welcoming and inclusive for all participants, regardless of their cultural background. This can involve using visual aids, providing translation services, or creating physical spaces that are accessible and comfortable for everyone.
6. Engage with the community: Build partnerships with local organizations and community groups that serve immigrant populations. This can help ensure that cultural programs are tailored to meet the specific needs of the target audience.
7. Develop culturally responsive marketing materials: Create marketing materials that are tailored to the language and cultural preferences of the immigrant community. This can involve using images, messaging, or channels that resonate with the target audience.
8. Provide opportunities for mentorship and networking: Offer programs that connect immigrants with local mentors or professionals who can provide guidance and support in navigating US culture and society.
9. Address systemic barriers: Identify and address any systemic barriers that may prevent immigrants from participating in cultural programs, such as lack of access to transportation or childcare.
