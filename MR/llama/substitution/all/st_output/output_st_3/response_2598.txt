Native English speakers over the age of 90 face unique challenges in the healthcare system due to various factors. Here are some of the challenges they may encounter:

1. Communication barriers: Older adults with limited mobility or dementia may struggle to communicate their needs or concerns to healthcare providers, leading to misunderstandings or misdiagnoses.
2. Difficulty navigating complex systems: The healthcare system can be confusing and overwhelming for older adults, particularly those who are not tech-savvy or have cognitive impairments. They may struggle to access information, schedule appointments, or understand their treatment options.
3. Limited access to care: Many older adults live in areas with limited healthcare resources, which can result in longer wait times, fewer appointment options, and reduced access to specialized care.
4. Ageism and stereotyping: Unfortunately, ageism and stereotypes still exist in the healthcare system, leading to inadequate care or assumptions about older adults' abilities to manage their own health. Healthcare providers may not take their concerns or preferences into account, resulting in suboptimal treatment plans.
5. Physical limitations: Older adults may experience physical limitations that make it difficult for them to travel to appointments, undergo procedures, or follow treatment regimens. They may also have difficulty managing medications or performing daily tasks due to decreased mobility or dexterity.
6. Dementia and cognitive impairment: Many older adults suffer from dementia or cognitive impairment, which can make it challenging for them to communicate their symptoms or needs to healthcare providers. This can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, or inappropriate care.
7. Social isolation: Older adults may experience social isolation due to declining health, loss of loved ones, or decreased mobility, which can negatively impact their mental health and ability to navigate the healthcare system.
8. Lack of geriatric-trained providers: Many areas have a shortage of healthcare providers trained in geriatrics, leading to a lack of specialized care and support for older adults.
9. Inadequate pain management
