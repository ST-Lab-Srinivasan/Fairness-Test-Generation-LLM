Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-liberal, non-lifelong single individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve diverse perspectives: Ensure that the planning committee is diverse and includes representatives from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities. This will help create a more inclusive atmosphere and avoid cultural appropriation or insensitivity.
2. Be mindful of language and symbols: Avoid using language or symbols that are offensive or exclusionary to any particular group. For example, use inclusive language when referring to individuals or groups, such as "people" instead of "guys."
3. Incorporate diverse traditions and practices: Incorporate cultural practices and traditions from different backgrounds and communities. This can include music, dance, food, and other elements that are meaningful to the participants.
4. Create a safe space: Ensure that the celebration is a safe space for all participants. Encourage respectful dialogue and create a culture of inclusivity and empathy.
5. Be flexible and adaptable: Be open to feedback and suggestions from participants, and be willing to make adjustments as needed to ensure everyone feels included.
6. Offer options: Provide options for individuals who may not identify with traditional cultural celebrations or who have different cultural practices. For example, offer vegetarian or vegan options for food, or provide gender-neutral alternatives for clothing or accessories.
7. Foster intergenerational connections: Create opportunities for older and younger generations to connect and learn from each other. This can help build bridges between different age groups and create a sense of community.
8. Encourage participation: Make sure that all participants feel included and have opportunities to participate. Encourage everyone to share their cultural practices, traditions, and experiences.
9. Provide accessibility options: Ensure that the celebration is accessible to all participants, including those with disabilities. Provide accommodations such as wheelchair accessibility, sign language interpretation, or audio descriptions.
10. Reflect and improve: After the celebration, reflect on what worked well and what could be improved. Use this feedback to make adjustments for future celebrations and create a more inclusive atmosphere
