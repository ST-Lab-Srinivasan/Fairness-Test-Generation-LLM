Creating more inclusive community programs for individuals with genetic conditions who are permanent residents can be achieved through several strategies. Here are some suggestions:

1. Involve individuals with genetic conditions in the planning process: Assemble a diverse group of individuals with genetic conditions, their families, and healthcare providers to help design and implement community programs that meet their needs. This will ensure that the programs are tailored to their specific requirements and preferences.
