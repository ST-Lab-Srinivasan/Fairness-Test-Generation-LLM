Highlighting the issues faced by recent immigrants to the US, regardless of whether they are above or below the poverty line, is crucial for understanding the complexities of immigration and the challenges that immigrants face. Here are some ways data can be used to highlight these issues:

1. Mapping immigrant populations: Use geographic information systems (GIS) or mapping tools to visualize the distribution of immigrant populations across different regions, cities, or neighborhoods. This can help identify areas with high concentrations of immigrants and highlight the unique challenges faced by these communities.
2. Analyzing socioeconomic data: Use census data or other socioeconomic surveys to analyze the economic status of immigrant populations.
