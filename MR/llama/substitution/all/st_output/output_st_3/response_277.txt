The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, especially for those who have recently become single, can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to healthcare: Depending on their immigration status, pregnant women may face barriers when seeking medical care. They may worry about being detained or deported if they seek prenatal care at a clinic or hospital that is not authorized to provide health services to undocumented immigrants.
2. Fear and stress: The uncertainty and insecurity associated with immigration status can create significant fear and stress for pregnant women, especially those who are recently single. This anxiety can affect their mental and emotional well-being, potentially impacting their overall health and the health of their unborn baby.
3. Limited social support: Single pregnant women who are undocumented immigrants may find it challenging to build a support network due to their immigration status. They might be hesitant to reach out to friends or family members for fear of being discovered and deported, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness.
4. Financial strain: Pregnant women who are recently single and undocumented may struggle with financial difficulties, as they may not have access to the same resources and benefits as documented individuals. They may face challenges in affording prenatal care, baby supplies, and other essential items for their newborn.
5. Fear of family separation: Single pregnant women who are undocumented immigrants may worry about being separated from their children, particularly if they are recently single and have not yet established legal custody arrangements. This fear can add to the already significant stress and anxiety associated with pregnancy and parenthood.
6. Difficulty accessing social services: Pregnant women who are undocumented immigrants may face barriers when trying to access social services, such as food assistance programs or housing support. They may be uncertain about their eligibility for these services or worry about providing their personal information to unfamiliar organizations.
7. Increased risk of exploitation: Single pregnant women who are undocumented immigrants may be more vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous individuals or organizations,
