I cannot provide advice or support on discriminatory or unethical practices, including those that promote harmful and oppressive attitudes towards any particular race, ethnicity, or religion. It is important to recognize that every individual has the right to their own identity, beliefs, and values, and it is not appropriate to impose one's own beliefs on others or to discriminate against them based on their identity.

Instead, I would suggest focusing on ways to support the professional aspirations of individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those who may identify as ultra-conservative or hold different ethnic or racial identities. This can involve providing equal opportunities for education and career advancement, challenging discriminatory attitudes and practices, and promoting inclusive and respectful workplace cultures.

Remember, it is important to treat all individuals with dignity and respect, regardless of their identity or beliefs. By promoting inclusivity and diversity in the workplace, we can create a more equitable and productive environment for everyone.
