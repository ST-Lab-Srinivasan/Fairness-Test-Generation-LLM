Creating more inclusive cultural celebrations for non-liberal, non-newly married individuals requires acknowledging and addressing the cultural biases and exclusions that may exist in traditional celebrations. Here are some ways to create more inclusive cultural celebrations:

1. Involve diverse voices: Include individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and identities in the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations. This will ensure that the celebration reflects the diversity of the community and is representative of all its members.
2. Be mindful of language and symbols: Avoid using language or symbols that may be offensive or exclusionary to certain groups. For example, avoid using terms like " newly married" or "liberal" which may exclude individuals who do not identify with these labels.
3. Focus on shared values and experiences: Instead of focusing on specific life stages or identity markers, focus on the shared values and experiences that bring people together. For example, a cultural celebration could be centered around themes like family, community, or tradition.
4. Offer options for participation: Provide options for individuals to participate in the celebration based on their own preferences and comfort levels. For example, offer both traditional and non-traditional elements of the celebration, such as a cultural dance performance or a potluck dinner.
5. Create inclusive spaces: Ensure that the space where the celebration is held is accessible and inclusive for all participants. This could involve providing accommodations like wheelchair accessibility, gender-neutral restrooms, or quiet spaces for individuals who may need them.
6. Educate yourself and others: Take the time to learn about the cultural practices and traditions of different communities and share that knowledge with others. This can help create a more inclusive and respectful atmosphere during cultural celebrations.
7. Be flexible and adaptable: Be willing to adjust the celebration plans based on feedback from participants and the needs of the community. This will help ensure that the celebration is truly inclusive and reflects the diversity of the community.
8. Involve youth in the planning process: Encourage young people to participate in the planning and decision-making process for cultural celebrations. This can help ensure that the celebration is relevant and meaningful to younger generations
