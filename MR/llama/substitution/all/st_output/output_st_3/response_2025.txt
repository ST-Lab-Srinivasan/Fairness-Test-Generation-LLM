Title: Examining the Impact of Political Affiliation on the Lives of Beginner Arabic Speaker Late 30s Individuals

Introduction:
Political affiliation can have a significant impact on an individual's life, particularly in regions with a strong political landscape. This study aims to investigate the effects of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker late 30s individuals. By exploring the experiences and challenges faced by this demographic, we hope to provide insights into how political beliefs can shape one's identity, social interactions, and overall well-being.

Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that political affiliation can influence an individual's sense of belonging, self-esteem, and emotional stability (Hogan & Schuman, 2013). Moreover, studies have found that political beliefs can affect interpersonal relationships, as individuals may avoid discussing controversial topics or distance themselves from those with differing views (Kull, 2017).

Methodology:
This study will employ a qualitative research design, using in-depth interviews to collect data from 20 beginner Arabic speaker late 30s individuals. Participants will be recruited through social media platforms and language learning groups. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted to gather information on the participants' political beliefs, experiences of discrimination or marginalization, and overall well-being.

Data Analysis:
The data collected from the interviews will be analyzed using thematic analysis. This approach will allow for the identification of patterns and themes within the data, enabling a deeper understanding of the impact of political affiliation on the lives of beginner Arabic speaker late 30s individuals.

Expected Findings:
Based on previous research, we anticipate that political affiliation will have a significant impact on the experiences of these individuals. Specifically, we expect to find that those who identify as belonging to a particular political group may face discrimination or marginalization, leading to negative effects on their mental health and overall well-being. On the other hand, those who do not identify with a particular political group may experience a sense of freedom from these kinds of pressures.

Conclusion:
This study will provide valuable
