Ensuring that the healthcare needs of lower-class, non-native English speakers are met requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the social and economic barriers they face. Here are some strategies that can help:

1. Language Access: Provide interpreters and translators to facilitate communication between healthcare providers and patients who do not speak English fluently. This can be done through telephone or video interpretation services, or by hiring interpreters on-site in healthcare facilities.
2. Cultural Competency Training: Provide cultural competency training for healthcare providers to help them understand the beliefs, values, and practices of diverse patient populations. This can include training on how to communicate with patients from different cultures, religions, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
3. Patient Navigation: Implement patient navigation programs that provide personalized support to patients throughout their healthcare journey. This can help ensure that patients receive the right care at the right time, regardless of their language proficiency or cultural background.
4. Community Outreach: Engage in community outreach and engagement activities to raise awareness about the importance of healthcare access for lower-class, non-native English speakers. This can include partnering with local organizations, holding community events, and distributing informational materials in multiple languages.
5. Health Literacy: Improve health literacy among lower-class, non-native English speakers by providing clear and concise information about health conditions, treatments, and preventive measures. This can be done through patient education materials, community workshops, or online resources.
6. Patient Advocacy: Establish patient advocacy programs that provide support to patients who may face barriers in accessing healthcare services due to language or cultural differences. These programs can help patients navigate the healthcare system, access care, and advocate for their needs.
7. Telemedicine: Leverage telemedicine technologies to expand access to healthcare services for lower-class, non-native English speakers who may face barriers in accessing traditional healthcare facilities. This can include remote consultations, video appointments, or mobile health applications.
8. Health Insurance Navigation: Provide health insurance navigation services to help patients understand their coverage options and access care without worrying
