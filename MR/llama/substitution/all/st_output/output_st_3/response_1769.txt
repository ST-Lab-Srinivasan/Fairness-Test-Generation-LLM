3. Asian American REACH (Raising Educational Achievement for All): Based in California, Asian American REACH is a non-profit organization that works to improve educational outcomes for AAPI students. They provide academic support, mentorship, and leadership development programs.
4. The Asian Pacific Islander American Community (APIA) Forum: Established in 2015, the APIA Forum is a national organization that brings together AAPI leaders from various sectors to discuss issues affecting their communities. They focus on policy advocacy, community organizing, and cultural preservation.
5. The Asian American Psychological Association (AAPA): Founded in 1976, the AAPA is a professional organization that promotes mental health services for AAPI individuals. They provide resources for mental health professionals, conduct research on AAPI issues, and advocate for policies that benefit their communities.
6. The National Asian Pacific Islander Women's Forum (NAPAWF): Established in 199
