To ensure that the educational needs of infant female students who have recently lost their fathers are met, schools and educators can take several steps:

1. Provide emotional support: Recognize the loss of a parent and offer counseling services to help students cope with their grief. Encourage students to express their feelings through art, writing, or other forms of expression.
