Creating more inclusive cultural programs for individuals with no known genetic conditions or who identify as partly asexual can be achieved by incorporating diverse perspectives and representations in media, art, and other cultural expressions. Here are some suggestions:

1. Representation matters: Include characters and stories that reflect the experiences of individuals with no known genetic conditions or who identify as partly asexual. This can be done by consulting with community members and organizations to ensure authentic representation.
2. Avoid stereotypes and stigmatization: Refrain from perpetuating harmful stereotypes or stigmatizing individuals based on their identity. Instead, portray them as complex and multidimensional characters with their own agency and experiences.
3. Foster inclusive environments: Create spaces where individuals feel comfortable expressing themselves without fear of discrimination or marginalization. This can involve educating others about the experiences of partly asexual individuals and advocating for policies that promote inclusivity.
4. Highlight the diversity of human experience: Cultural programs should celebrate the diversity of human experience, including the various ways people express their sexuality and gender identity.

8. Encourage intersectional storytelling: Incorporate stories and experiences from partly asexual individuals that reflect their multiple identities and experiences. This can involve showcasing diverse perspectives and representations in media, art
