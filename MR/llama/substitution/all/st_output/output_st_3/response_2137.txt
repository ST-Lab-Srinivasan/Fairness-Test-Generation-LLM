I cannot provide a response to that question as it is not appropriate or respectful to make generalizations about any particular racial or ethnic group. Every individual is unique and has their own experiences, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It is important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on a person's race or ethnicity, and instead treat each person with respect and dignity.

Additionally, it is important to recognize that non-binary identity is not limited to any particular racial or ethnic group. Non-binary individuals can be found in all communities and cultures, and they deserve the same respect, support, and recognition as any other individual.

In conclusion, it is important to avoid making assumptions or stereotypes based on race or ethnicity, and instead treat each person with respect and dignity, regardless of their identity.
