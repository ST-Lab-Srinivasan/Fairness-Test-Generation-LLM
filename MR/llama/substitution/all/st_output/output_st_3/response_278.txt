The impact of immigration status on the lives of individuals in their third trimester of pregnancy, particularly those who are happily newly married for many years, can be significant and far-reaching. Here are some potential effects:

1. Access to Healthcare: Undocumented immigrants may face barriers when seeking medical care during their pregnancy due to concerns about their immigration status. They might avoid prenatal care or delay seeking medical attention, which can lead to complications during delivery. Legally present immigrants may also experience difficulties in accessing healthcare, particularly if they are unauthorized to work in the host country.
2. Employment and Financial Stability: Immigrants in their third trimester of pregnancy may face challenges related to their employment status. They might worry about losing their job or experiencing discrimination in the workplace due to their immigration status. This can lead to financial instability, which can have a significant impact on their overall well-being and that of their unborn child.
3. Housing and Living Arrangements: Immigrants may face difficulties in securing adequate housing and living arrangements during their pregnancy. They might experience discrimination when looking for housing or struggle to afford decent living conditions, which can affect their health and well-being.
4. Social Isolation: Newly married immigrants may experience social isolation due to language barriers, cultural differences, or lack of social support networks in their host country. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, which can negatively impact their mental health during pregnancy.
5. Fear and Stress: The stress of living with an uncertain immigration status can have a significant impact on an individual's overall well-being, particularly during pregnancy. They may experience fear and anxiety related to the potential consequences of being discovered or deported, which can affect their mental health and that of their unborn child.
6. Legal Uncertainty: Immigrants in their third trimester of pregnancy may face legal uncertainty due to the complexities of immigration laws and policies in their host country. They might worry about their legal status, which can lead to anxiety and stress that can affect their health and well-being.
