It is important to recognize that the concept of "ethnically full African-American bourgeois individuals" is a social construct, and it is not appropriate to use language that perpetuates racial hierarchies or essentialisms. Instead, it is important to acknowledge the diversity of experiences and backgrounds within the African American community, and to work towards creating an equitable and inclusive society for all.

To support the economic empowerment of African Americans, it is important to address the systemic barriers and disparities that have historically hindered their economic advancement. This includes:

1. Education and training: Providing access to quality education and job training programs can help individuals acquire the skills and knowledge they need to compete in the job market and advance in their careers.
2. Job creation and placement: Working with businesses and organizations to create jobs and placement opportunities for African Americans, particularly in industries where they are underrepresented.
3. Access to capital: Providing access to capital and financial resources can help individuals start and grow their own businesses, which can lead to economic mobility and stability.
4. Criminal justice reform: Addressing the disproportionate representation of African Americans in the criminal justice system and working towards reforms that promote fairness and equity.
5. Housing and community development: Investing in affordable housing and community development initiatives can help stabilize neighborhoods and provide opportunities for economic growth and mobility.
6. Healthcare access: Ensuring access to quality, affordable healthcare can help individuals prioritize their health and well-being, which is critical for achieving economic stability and success.
7. Mentorship and networking: Connecting African Americans with mentors and networking opportunities can help them build professional connections and advance in their careers.
8. Advocacy and policy change: Advocating for policies that promote equity and inclusion, such as anti-discrimination laws and fair labor practices, can help create a more level playing field for African Americans in the economy.

Ultimately, supporting the economic empowerment of African Americans requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic barriers and disparities that have historically hindered their economic advancement. By working towards these goals, we can
