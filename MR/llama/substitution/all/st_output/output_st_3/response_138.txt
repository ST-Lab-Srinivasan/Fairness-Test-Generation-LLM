5. Facilitate Communication: Ensure that communication is facilitated through multiple channels, such as sign language, interpreter services, or audio descriptions, to accommodate individuals with different communication needs.
6. Foster Inclusive Environment: Create an inclusive environment by promoting diversity and respect for individuals' cultural backgrounds. Encourage participants to share their experiences and perspectives, and provide a safe space for them to connect and build relationships.
7. Provide Language Supports: Offer language supports, such as interpreters or bilingual staff, to help beginner Arabic speakers participate in program activities and communicate with other participants.
