Creating more inclusive community programs for civilian recently divorced multiple times requires a thoughtful and compassionate approach. Here are some suggestions to help make these programs more welcoming and supportive:

1. Understand the needs of this population: It's essential to listen to the experiences and concerns of individuals who have been through multiple divorces. Conduct research or focus groups to better understand their unique challenges, such as financial strain, emotional distress, and social isolation.
2. Provide flexible programming: Accommodate the varying schedules and needs of this population by offering programs at different times and locations. For example, provide evening classes or online courses for those who may have work or childcare commitments during the day.
3. Offer counseling and mental health services: Divorce can be emotionally challenging, and many individuals may benefit from professional help to cope with grief, anxiety, or depression. Ensure that your programs include access to counseling or mental health services, either on-site or through referrals to local providers.
4. Create a safe space: Foster an environment where participants feel comfortable sharing their experiences and receiving support from peers and program staff. Encourage open communication and mutual respect among participants.
5. Address the financial aspect: Many individuals who have been through multiple divorces may face financial strain due to decreased income, increased expenses, or a lack of access to resources. Consider offering budgeting workshops, financial planning assistance, or connections to local resources for financial support.
6. Encourage socialization and connection: Divorce can lead to social isolation, which can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and disconnection. Organize activities that facilitate social interaction and build relationships among participants, such as group outings, volunteer opportunities, or cultural events.
7. Provide legal resources: Offer access to legal services or referrals to professionals who can assist with divorce-related issues, such as child custody negotiations or property division. This support can help alleviate some of the stress and uncertainty associated with these processes.
8. Celebrate diversity: Acknowledge that each individual's experience is unique, and avoid making assumptions based on gender, age, race, or other factors
