Creating more inclusive recreational activities for people who are not deeply in poverty requires a thoughtful and multi-faceted approach. Here are some strategies that communities and organizations can consider:

1. Identify and address barriers: Understand the specific barriers that may prevent individuals from participating in recreational activities, such as lack of transportation, limited access to facilities, or cultural or social factors. Once identified, develop solutions to address these barriers.
