Creating more inclusive cultural programs for beginner Chinese speakers who are also mixed African-American individuals requires a thoughtful and intentional approach. Here are some suggestions:

1. Incorporate diverse representation: Ensure that the cultural program includes representations of mixed race individuals, as well as other underrepresented groups in Chinese culture, such as LGBTQ+ individuals or people with disabilities.
2. Use inclusive language: Avoid using language that is exclusive or marginalizing to any group. Use inclusive language and terminology that acknowledges the diversity of participants' backgrounds.
3. Provide cultural context: Offer educational materials or workshops that provide cultural context for the Chinese language and customs, taking into account the diverse experiences and perspectives of the participants.
4. Foster a safe and inclusive environment: Create a space where all participants feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and opinions without fear of judgment or marginalization. Encourage open communication and active listening to ensure that everyone's voice is heard.
5. Address systemic barriers: Acknowledge any systemic barriers that may exist in the cultural program, such as lack of access to resources or opportunities for marginalized groups. Work towards addressing these barriers to create a more equitable and inclusive environment.
6. Involve diverse instructors: Ensure that the cultural program is led by instructors who are representative of the diversity of the participants, including mixed race individuals and other underrepresented groups.
7. Provide opportunities for cultural exchange: Create opportunities for participants to share their cultural practices and traditions with one another, fostering mutual understanding and respect.
8. Address stereotypes and biases: Acknowledge any stereotypes or biases that may exist in the cultural program, such as perpetuating stereotypes of mixed race individuals or other marginalized groups. Work towards addressing these issues to create a more inclusive environment.
9. Encourage self-expression: Provide opportunities for participants to express themselves through various forms of artistic expression, such as music, dance, or visual arts. This can help foster a sense of identity and belonging among the participants.
10. Continuously evaluate and improve: Regularly assess the inclusivity of the cultural program
