As an empathetic and socially conscious AI language model, I appreciate your concern for the well-being of individuals who identify as strictly party asexual, lifelong singles, or those who have recently gone through a breakup.

1. Surveys and questionnaires: Conduct online surveys or questionnaires to gather data on the experiences of strictly party asexual individuals, lifelong singles, or those who have recently gone through a breakup.
