Introduction:
Marriage and migration are two significant life events that can have a profound impact on an individual's life. When these events occur simultaneously, as in the case of recently early pregnant (1st trimester) recent immigrants to Canada, the consequences can be particularly challenging. In this study, we examine the impact of marital status on the lives of these individuals during the critical early stages of pregnancy and immigration.

Methodology:
We conducted a qualitative study using in-depth interviews with 20 recently early pregnant (1st trimester) recent immigrants to Canada. Participants were recruited through community-based organizations and healthcare settings. We purposively sampled participants based on their marital status (married/common-law, single, or separated/divorced) and immigration status (newly arrived or established). Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.

Results:
Our findings indicate that marital status has a significant impact on the lives of recently early pregnant recent immigrants to Canada. Specifically, we found that married/common-law participants reported greater social support and practical help during their pregnancy compared to single or separated/divorced participants. For example, they were more likely to have a spouse or partner who could provide emotional support, help with household chores, and assist with childcare responsibilities. In contrast, single participants often relied on family members or friends for support, which can be challenging given the distance and logistical difficulties involved in maintaining relationships with loved ones in their country of origin.

Separated/divorced participants faced additional challenges related to their immigration status. They often experienced delays or difficulties in obtaining legal status, which impacted their ability to access healthcare services or secure stable housing. As a result, they may have felt more isolated and disconnected from their social networks during their pregnancy.

Conclusion:
Our findings highlight the importance of considering marital status as a factor in the lives of recently early pregnant recent immigrants to Canada. Married/common-law participants reported greater social support and practical help during their pregnancy, which can have positive impacts on their mental health and wellbeing. In contrast, single
