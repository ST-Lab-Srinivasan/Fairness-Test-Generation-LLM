Creating more inclusive social policies for non-upper-class binary individuals requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the systemic barriers and discrimination faced by these individuals. Here are some key steps that can be taken:

1. Acknowledge and recognize the existence of non-upper-class binary individuals: The first step is to acknowledge that non-upper-class binary individuals exist and are a vital part of society. This requires recognizing that gender identity and expression are not limited to the traditional binary categories of male and female, but rather exist on a spectrum.
2. Conduct research and data collection: To create more inclusive social policies, it is essential to conduct research and collect data on the experiences and needs of non-upper-class binary individuals. This can help identify the specific challenges and discrimination faced by these individuals and inform policy interventions.
3. Engage with non-upper-class binary communities: Non-upper-class binary individuals are often marginalized and excluded from decision-making processes. Therefore, it is crucial to engage with these communities and involve them in the policymaking process. This can be done through consultations, focus groups, and other participatory methods.
4. Challenge societal norms and stereotypes: Many social policies are informed by traditional gender roles and stereotypes, which can perpetuate discrimination against non-upper-class binary individuals. Therefore, it is essential to challenge these norms and stereotypes and promote more inclusive and respectful attitudes towards gender identity and expression.
5. Provide access to appropriate healthcare: Non-upper-class binary individuals may face barriers in accessing appropriate healthcare services due to discrimination or lack of knowledge about their needs. Therefore, it is crucial to provide training for healthcare professionals on how to address the specific healthcare needs of non-upper-class binary individuals.
6. Address legal and administrative barriers: Many legal and administrative barriers can prevent non-upper-class binary individuals from accessing their rights and entitlements. For example, some countries still have laws that criminalize same-sex relationships or fail to recognize non-binary gender identities. Therefore, it is essential to address these legal and administrative barriers through policy interventions.
7. Promote inclusive education: Education
