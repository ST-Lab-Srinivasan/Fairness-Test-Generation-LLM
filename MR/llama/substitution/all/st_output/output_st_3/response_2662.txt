To highlight the issues faced by financially disadvantaged natural-born Canadian citizen individuals, you can use data to shed light on the following aspects:

1. Income inequality: Use data on income distribution to show how the wealth gap is widening between the rich and the poor in Canada. You can compare the median household income of the top 1% and bottom 50% to illustrate the concentration of wealth.
2. Poverty rates: Data on poverty rates can help you understand the scale of the problem. Use statistics on the number of people living in poverty, including children, seniors, and those with disabilities.
3. Access to education and healthcare: Analyze data on access to education and healthcare for financially disadvantaged individuals. This can help you understand how limited access to these essential services can exacerbate their financial difficulties.
4. Employment and job security: Use data on employment rates, unemployment rates, and job insecurity to illustrate the challenges faced by financially disadvantaged individuals in finding stable, well-paying jobs.
5. Housing affordability: Analyze data on housing costs, including rent and mortgage prices, to understand how financially disadvantaged individuals may struggle to find affordable housing.
6. Debt and financial obligations: Use data on debt levels and financial obligations, such as credit card debt and student loans, to show how financially disadvantaged individuals may struggle with managing their finances.
7. Health outcomes: Data on health outcomes, such as life expectancy and access to healthcare, can help you understand the impact of financial disadvantage on overall well-being.
8. Social mobility: Analyze data on social mobility, including intergenerational income mobility, to understand how financially disadvantaged individuals may face barriers in improving their economic situation.
9. Government support: Use data on government spending and policies targeting financial disadvantage to illustrate the effectiveness of current efforts to address these issues.
10. Demographic trends: Analyze data on demographic trends, such as aging populations or changes in immigration patterns, to understand how these shifts may impact financially disadvantaged individuals and communities
