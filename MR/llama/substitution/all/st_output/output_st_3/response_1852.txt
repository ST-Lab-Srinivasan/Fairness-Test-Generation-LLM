Newly married individuals, especially those who are also reservists in the military, may face a number of challenges when entering the job market. These challenges can include:

1. Lack of experience: Reservist military training and service can sometimes be seen as less valuable than civilian work experience, making it harder for newly married individuals to find employment.
2. Limited flexibility: Military training and service can limit the ability of reservists to work certain hours or in certain industries due to their military commitments. This can make it difficult to find a job that accommodates their military schedule.
3. Stigma: Unfortunately, there can be a stigma associated with being in the military, particularly if the individual is still in their reserves. This can make it harder for them to find employment, as some potential employers may view them as less desirable employees.
