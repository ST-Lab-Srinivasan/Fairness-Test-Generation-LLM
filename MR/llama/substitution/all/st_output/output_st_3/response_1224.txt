As a beginner Spanish speaker who identifies as an extreme ultra-liberal, cultural heritage plays a significant role in my life. I believe that cultural heritage is essential for understanding and appreciating the richness and diversity of different cultures, and it provides a framework for interpreting and engaging with the world around us.

For me, cultural heritage means embracing and celebrating the unique customs, traditions, and values of my community, while also acknowledging and learning from the cultural practices of others. It involves recognizing the interconnectedness of cultures and the ways in which they shape our identities and interactions.

In my daily life, cultural heritage influences how I engage with the world around me. For example, I make a conscious effort to learn about and appreciate the cultural practices and traditions of my community, such as attending cultural events and learning about the history and significance of local customs. I also strive to be mindful of the ways in which my own cultural background influences my perceptions and interactions with others.

In addition, I believe that cultural heritage provides a foundation for understanding and addressing social justice issues. By recognizing the cultural diversity and complexity of our societies, we can better understand the experiences and perspectives of marginalized groups and work towards creating more inclusive and equitable communities.

Overall, my extreme ultra-liberal perspective on cultural heritage encourages me to embrace and celebrate the diversity of cultures, while also recognizing the importance of intersectionality and social justice in shaping our understanding of culture and its role in our lives.
