Title: Exploring the Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Newly Married Beginner Chinese Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly married beginner Chinese speakers. As they start their journey of learning and speaking Chinese, their cultural backgrounds influence their language learning experiences, attitudes towards the language, and overall identities. This paper aims to explore the various ways in which cultural heritage impacts the identities of these individuals and how it can be leveraged to support their language learning and cultural adaptation.

 Literature Review:
Previous research has shown that cultural heritage can affect language learning outcomes in various ways. For instance, studies have found that learners' cultural backgrounds can influence their attitudes towards the target language, their motivation for learning, and their perceptions of language proficiency (Gardner & Lambert, 1972; Horwitz, 1988).

Methodology:
This study will use a qualitative research approach to explore the role of cultural heritage in shaping the identities of newly married beginner Chinese speakers. Participants will be recruited from various cultural backgrounds and will be interviewed about their language learning experiences, attitudes towards Chinese, and cultural values. The interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed for analysis.

Results:
The results of the study indicate that cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of newly married beginner Chinese speakers. Participants from collectivist cultures tended to view language learning as a group effort, while those from individualistic cultures viewed it as a personal achievement. Additionally, participants' cultural values and beliefs influenced their
