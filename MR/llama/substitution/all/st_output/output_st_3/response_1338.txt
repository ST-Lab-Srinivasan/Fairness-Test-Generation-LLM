5. Cultural Competency: Develop cultural competency among decision-makers by educating them on the values, beliefs, and practices of native Arabic speakers. This could involve cultural sensitivity training or cross-cultural communication workshops.
6. Access to Information: Ensure that native Arabic speakers have access to information about decision-making processes and opportunities for participation. This could involve providing clear and concise information in their native language, as well as using technology to facilitate access to information.
7. Safe Spaces: Create safe spaces for native Arabic speakers to express their opinions and participate in decision-making processes without fear of judgment or discrimination.
