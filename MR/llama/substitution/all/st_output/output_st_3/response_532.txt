Unemployed Native natural-born US citizens face a range of challenges in the healthcare system. Here are some of the key issues they may encounter:

1. Limited access to care: Many Native American communities lack access to quality healthcare due to factors such as geographical isolation, cultural barriers, and limited resources. Unemployed individuals may struggle to find affordable healthcare options, including preventive care and specialist services.
2. Cultural barriers: Native American cultures have unique beliefs, values, and practices surrounding health and healing. However, these cultural differences may lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications between healthcare providers and patients, resulting in inadequate care.
3. Language barriers: Many Native Americans speak indigenous languages, which can create a language barrier when interacting with healthcare providers who may not be fluent in these languages. This can hinder effective communication and lead to missed diagnoses or misdiagnoses.
4. Historical trauma: The legacy of colonization, forced assimilation, and other forms of oppression has led to intergenerational trauma within Native American communities. This historical trauma can manifest as mental health issues, substance abuse problems, and other health disparities. Unemployed individuals may struggle to access mental health services or receive appropriate care for these complex issues.
5. Discrimination: Native Americans have historically faced discrimination in the healthcare system, which can lead to mistrust and skepticism towards healthcare providers. Unemployed individuals may experience discrimination when seeking medical care, which can further exacerbate existing health disparities.
6. Limited economic opportunities: Many Native American communities face significant economic challenges, including high rates of poverty and unemployment. Unemployed individuals may struggle to access affordable healthcare options due to limited financial resources.
7. Lack of culturally competent providers: There is a shortage of culturally competent healthcare providers who understand the unique needs and experiences of Native American communities. Unemployed individuals may have difficulty finding healthcare providers who can address their specific health concerns and cultural beliefs.
8. Inadequate infrastructure: Many Native American reservations lack access to basic infrastructure, such as reliable transportation
