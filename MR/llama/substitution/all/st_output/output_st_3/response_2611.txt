Title: The Role of Cultural Heritage in Shaping Identities of Happily Long-Time Married Beginner French Speakers

Introduction:
Cultural heritage plays a significant role in shaping the identities of happily long-time married beginner French speakers. This paper will explore how cultural heritage influences the language learning process, identity formation, and intercultural relationships among this demographic.

Literature Review:
Studies have shown that cultural heritage has a profound impact on an individual's language learning experience (Kramsch, 1993). For instance, individuals from collectivist cultures tend to prioritize group harmony over individualistic goals, which can affect their motivation for learning a foreign language (Hood, 2009). Similarly, the cultural background of learners can influence their perceptions of proficiency and their willingness to take risks in communication (Ellis, 2008).

Moreover, cultural heritage shapes an individual's identity formation through language learning. For example, individuals from cultures that value modesty and humility may find it challenging to express themselves freely in a foreign language due to their cultural upbringing (Gudykunst & Ting-Toomey, 1988). Similarly, the cultural context in which language is learned can influence how learners perceive themselves and their place in the world (Bernstein, 2000).

In addition, cultural heritage plays a significant role in intercultural relationships. For example, individuals from collectivist cultures may experience difficulties in communicating with those from individualistic cultures due to differences in communication styles and expectations (Gudykunst & Ting-Toomey, 1988). Similarly, cultural background can affect how learners perceive and interact with others from different cultural backgrounds (Hong & Kang, 2015).
